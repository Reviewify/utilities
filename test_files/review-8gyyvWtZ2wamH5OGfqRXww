Ice cream sandwiches with fresh cookies. So many combination's to choose from, it's like the Subway of Ice Cream Sandwiches. I personally love the Chocolate Cookie with White Chocolate Chips paired with the Cookies and Cream Ice Cream. Although the line may look long at times, they serve their customers pretty fast. Regardless, you can never go wrong with the price of $1.50 for a premium  ice cream sandwich.", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-23", "type": "review"}
