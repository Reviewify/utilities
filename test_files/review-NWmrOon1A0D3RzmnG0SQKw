On my last outing, I had their filet w/mash and mushroom gravy. The filet was perfectly cooked and was of excellent quality. Being that it was a10 oz filet, the price was about 23 dollars which actually is quite reasonable when compared to some other establishments in the Providence area. The service has always been average, never above and beyond but also never bad.  You will most likely have to park in the Providence Place mall which will run you a buck for the first three hours. It's an especially nice joint to eat at during the summer. That is when they open all of the street side windows.  As far as decor goes. It's a rather elegant place that manages to look sophisticated without being overly stuffy and off putting.  I highly recommend Joe's to any and everyone. Whether you're looking for a simple burger or a 10 oz filet. Joe's has you covered.", "business_id": "AMcQOPu1hcSl7f6iguru3Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-19", "type": "review"}
