Authentic atmosphere, down-to-earth service. The food was spectacular (I got a bacon and guacamole omelet). I got fresh fruit and of course a huge biscuit. Yes, it's an experience - don't expect to be in and out of there in a 1/2 hour. But that's part of what makes it great - it's very relaxed in there, almost feels Southern. I will definitely be returning. My only complaint?? Why do they close so early?? I would die happy if they had late night breakfast :) :)", "business_id": "sxHugC9jE_yfkn460JMV_w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-23", "type": "review"}
