The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and the cheese is just delicious.  The specialty slices are something that puts South U Pizza at the top. Make sure you get the buffalo chicken or the four mushroom pizza. they are my favorites. Lately in this cold weather, I have not gone out much and been able to get my daily slices but the people working there are nice enough to deliver slices to me. What other pizzeria will deliver slices? NONE. South U Pizza has my vote for Best of Ann Arbor this year. 5 stars is really an understatement.", "business_id": "1BX80nfhUO9rzrmY1iURWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-03", "type": "review"}
