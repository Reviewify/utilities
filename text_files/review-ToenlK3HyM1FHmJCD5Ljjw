Yougurtland is aptly named as it is one part foodstuff provider + one part adventure park.  \n\nSince they are of the same model, I compare Y-land to Creations.  One might say that where Creations was set forth on this earth as is, Yogurtland has evolved into a better more efficient ForYo model.  It is slightly cheaper, offers double - if not more than double - the toppings to choose from, plus their fruit is fresh.  Also, their spoons are biodegradable, as opposed to landfill waiting to happen you get at Creations.\n\nAll of which leads me to choose yogurt-evolution over a less-than-fully-intelligent yogurt design. I will go to Yougurtland over Creations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hhfga62zdR5TxuqtleNHCg"}
