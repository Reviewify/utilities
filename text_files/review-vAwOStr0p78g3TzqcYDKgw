Cafe Durant is quite a unique place. where you get in a line to order, and they bring your food to you. Service is often quite slow, to be honest, so don't come here if you're in a hurry.  They have a beer pong table sometimes, and there are often bros in there, being bros, but that's just part of the whole thing, and they never really get that rowdy. They also have super cheap pitchers, if you go during happy hour. The have TVs so you can watch baseball, and a random cast iron stove in the corner.  Their sandwiches are bomb, and their mole burritos are, as well. You may have to wait a little while, but for a nice, cheap meal, it's worth it. They also let you bring in (non alcoholic, I think) beverages from other places, so you can get boba down the street, and eat it with your bomb - ass brunch. Also, the tiki torches and rooftop seating at night? Love!", "business_id": "BOCJ5g4q1RhP8wikwwr3Ow", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-02", "type": "review"}
