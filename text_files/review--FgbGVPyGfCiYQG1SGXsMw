I LOVE burgers, so when I heard about Red Robin, I was excited.  I've been meaning to go, and I finally made it.\n\nI am in 100% agreement with Daniel B. that Five Guys is the #1 place in the area for a burger.  Ever get a Five Guys bacon cheeseburger (only wimps get the \"little burger\" with one paltry patty) with Everything on it?  It's the one of *the* best burgers for a chain, if not the best!\n\nHowever, the point goes to Red Robin for choices.  Many creative types of burgers.  I had the Royal, and it was very good.  Sooo many options!  They all sound so good.\n\nAh, but the steak fries suck.  They can make it bottomless all they want, but it's pretty mediocre.  Compare that to Five Guys fries, it's not even close.\n\nWhoa, but wait!  Ice cream root beer floats are also bottomless!  Point goes to RR.\n\nOverall, not a bad place for a family outing.  Cute decor, a balloon for my daughter, and a larger menu makes for a good chain experience, and the burger is good enough compromise so that the rest of my family can have something else.  That's something Five Guys cannot provide.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-7cDP00Kwa7zOtP6-B3s0Q"}
