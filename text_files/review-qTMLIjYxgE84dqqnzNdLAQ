It didn't help that I lived half a block away during my time there, but I probably was here 3-4 times a week.  During nice weather there are few places better to sit and enjoy some coffee.  The drinks are solid, but not spectacular and there's a decent array of cakes and pastries.  Also, the prices can't be beat, I still think it's under $3 for a large Bianca Mocha and the baristas are some of the fastest working around.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ"}
