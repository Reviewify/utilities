This location is now under new management and EVERY good nail tech has left. I'm looking for a new place to go now.  Previous Review: I've been going to this location for a while now and I always get an excellent pedicure (wish I could say the same about my manicure). Here's the trick for getting the best service. 1. STAY AWAY FROM THE MEN... they never do a good job. 2. Ask for Crystal, she's the best and the busiest so if you can't get her, look at the names on the sign in sheet and pick someone that has been request a lot. That's a good sign that they're good. Do not go to any random person. 3. This salon is one of the few that will still use the razor on your pedicure. Don't allow them to use it. Instead, get the callus (sp?) remover it cost $5 more but it does the trick and is better for you're skin. Spa Mani and Pedi cost $35 (including the extra $5 for the callus remover).", "business_id": "-xGIq1WisCfTcgyzu0D5Ig", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-30", "type": "review"}
