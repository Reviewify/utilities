The night I flew in, my bf and I drove straight here and were not disappointed at all!\n\nThe meat was tender and moist and the BBQ sauce was a fab accompaniment. I think the best was the pecan pie. Now, I'm not a fan of pecan pie at all. I don't go out of my way to eat it or buy any but we bought a slice since my bf is fanatic about it. After one bite of the pie, I ended  up polishing if off. It was so darn good! I would definitely recommend this place to others!", "type": "review", "business_id": "F-CnLwWvidsZqR9pLUrcBw"}
