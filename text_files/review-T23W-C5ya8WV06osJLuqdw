There is a lounge area on the first floor and a dining center upstairs. It's relatively small, but well decorated. We went for dinner and it was dimly lit. It is very apparent that Om tried to go for an exotic asian theme, which was executed well.\n\nFood: Everyone ordered different apps and a main course. It's been several months since we went, so what I am describing is based on my memory (I'm turning 28 soon, so I blame old age if I'm off on something!). I do remember how good the truffle-sprinked popcorn was though. They gave this as a snack food while we waited and it was deliciously addicting. I had sushi for my main course which was pretty good. I also tried out their version of mac & cheese. It was okay - nothing to write home about. The drinks were the most notable item we all talked about.  They had a cocktail infused with lavender that was strong, yet yummy. I could drink those all night!\n\nService: Adequate service. They had a minor problem with a drink one of the girls ordered, and didn't come by as often as I had expected, but nothing major to complain about.\n\nPrice: The bill was over $200 for the four of us, which included tips and a drink or two.\n\nCompared to all restaurants in Boston, it was above average, and worth trying out. For the price range though, there are better places out there to experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A"}
