The deal is that everything 'looks cheap.'  That's my main issue.  True, they do have a wall of earrings and racks of colorful skirts and loose pants but the jewelry looks like it hasn't gone through the final stages of finishing (i.e. jagged edges, discolored silver - do you want to polish when you get home?).  Also the fabric that the clothing was made out of was scratchy and the stitching wasn't of particular quality.\n\nThis shop is great if you are the trendy type and like to jump on and off band wagons without spending too much money to get the look ..and then move on.  If however, you're like me and like to plan out the content and quality of your wardrobe...the only things I would suggest buying there are the colorful, soft scarves they have on display out front.\n\nThe harshness of my criticism I guess comes from learning how to sew and making jewelry  (go hobbies!)...It's just drawn my attention to the details and maybe that's what's spoiled this place for me.\n\nThere's a place in North Beach that I like and sells better quality shtuff.  It's on Grant Ave between (I think it's) Green and Union, but it could also be a block farther down between Vallejo and Green.\n\nThe guy working at the shop is super nice and I'm sorry I didn't buy anything.  I just ache for small businesses right now...  ;o(", "type": "review", "business_id": "yNxLV3iX7ikziTduEuJmwA"}
