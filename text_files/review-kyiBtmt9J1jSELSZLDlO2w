The food is pretty average if you get the wrong stuff, If you do try their butter chicken pizza, you've hit the jackpot. That pizza has its own unique blend of Indian food and Pizza. If you have not tried this and you like Indian food. They also have a couple of Indian Sodas, which is amazing. I believe they had hookahs too when they started up.
