Because I love the moist texture of the cupcake itself and the frosting.. at times a bit sweeter than other times that I've been here though.\n\nBut to my preference ladies and gentlemen.. i would say my favorite cupcake here so far is the Strawberry flavored cupcake one!!!!\n\nIt's not too sweet! and the strawberry flavored cupcake is to die for!!! So Moist!!  I love the perfect balance in the frosting and cake they put into it.\n\nI've tried the vanilla cupcake also.. and I gotta say It's goood..the peace sign made me happy..\n\nThe store is very modern, simple, and cute. Workers are ready to serve you.. They write down your order first then go about their business and wrap your cakes in the box.. Very professional from what I have gotten so far.  I went during the day and both times no lines at all. So i am glad I haven't experienced the long lines at Sprinkles that everyone has been talking about.  \n\nAfter having these cupcakes.. I don't think I will ever eat Kara's Cupcakes ever again.. unless it is for free. then that's different issue.. but me paying for it... no thank you!! I will wait until I am in Palo Alto again!!!\n\np.s- the dog bites are so cute.. damn palo alto yuppies.. that they have treats for dogs like that for selll... What if I wanted a small cupcake for myself because I can't afford it?  I wonder what they would think if I just ate it right away.. hahahaha.. they would probably think i am poor :(", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
