Fully customizable and the toppings are very fresh. Nice crunch to the crust and gotta love that aroma from the woodfire.  The base Margherita pizza is delicious by itself but when you start to add your own toppings to it, it surely takes it up a notch. And if it doesn't taste good, it's probably because you got too adventurous and effed up the pizza by mixing things that shouldn't have been mixed in the first place. Definitely the best pizza in Westwood.", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}
