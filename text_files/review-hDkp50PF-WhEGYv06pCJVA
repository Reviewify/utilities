No, not in Timothy Leary's head. Austin artists have decorated The Jalopy with these fun, whimsical characters which is a perfect match to Nic, the fun, whimsical and very talented chef behind the unique array of rotisserie chicken sandwiches. Nic allowed me to bring my own gluten free bread for a delicious Son Hong sandwich consisting of juicy rotisserie chicken, pickled peppers, crunchy slaw and sweet, spicy chili sauce. My office mate had the Caprese, stacked with rotisserie chicken, lemon parsley pesto, fresh tomato and a thick slab of mozzarella cheese. We joyfully stuffed ourselves at a picnic table under a grove of trees. The menu details desserts such as a Little Debbie oatmeal cream pie and Bread Puddin' along with drinks and veggie chips (not a fan so much) plus assorted veggie sandwich options. When you go, be sure to check out Libby, the Liberated Lady, who stands in a box at the order desk. She invites you to pull down her skirt, and you should definitely submit to her wishes. I promise you will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "OIhLVqFOibyXnZCTlCt43A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-12", "type": "review"}
