Seriously, it has amazing rocks. The collection of minerals, rocks, semi-precious and precious gems is enough to make everyone from the most avid rock collector to a 3 year old go oooh and aah. They have incredible rare specimens from all corners of the earth. The glass flowers are also a must-see even if you don't like botany. They are works of art and it's hard to believe you aren't looking at living plants in the exhibit. The taxidermied animals have seen better days in terms of their preservation, but they are still fascinating to see. The fossils are fantastic. This museum is easily visited in an afternoon and it's definitely worth the trip. Update: I have learned that many of the taxidermied animals have been repaired and are in better condition now. Even more reason to visit!", "business_id": "MTGPiWQ0QS5IGjbBmZwTZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-27", "type": "review"}
