Driving down Kirby everyday, I am tempted often by the smells emanating from Goode Co. BBQ. I don't very often let myself indulge but I figured one good turn deserves another and so we took our sweaty selves to Goode Company. I have to agree with Jim M. - I am also a Yankee and definitely not a BBQ connoisseur, but I thoroughly enjoy the beef brisket sandwich, with some extra BBQ sauce. The jalapeno cheese bread is soft and delicious. Between the thickness of the bread and the amount of meat, a sandwich is really all you need, though the sides are also wonderful, albeit in my opinion a bit overpriced. This place also gets extra points for being very gluten-free friendly and even letting my mother in law and me see food labels to double check we were good to go :) One downside that others have mentioned is the outdoor seating. If you've lived in Houston for more than five minutes, you know it's pretty much always hot here. Heavy food and eating outside don't always go well together. There is seating inside but it's limited and you might end up getting surrounded by the people in line waiting to get their food. One solution - take it home! It tastes just as good, if not better, in your air conditioned abode.", "business_id": "F-CnLwWvidsZqR9pLUrcBw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-20", "type": "review"}
