The only one better was in Little Italy in SF (Sadly I forget the name). They serve your table with pieces of bread along with some exquisite olive tepanade. My colleagues could hardly get enough of the stuff and our waitress had to bring seconds. I found the veal absolutely amazing, so flavorful and tender. Several of my colleagues also loved veal and wanted to come the following day for lunch (they had sushi instead). Also great was the dual creme brulee, one half of the serving to be the classic creme and the other half being chocolate. OMG... absolutely decadent. The place was small and quaint and filled to capacity quickly for a Tuesday evening. You will have to park down the street or about a block away at a lot. Service was excellent. My colleagues ended up at a bar later that night down the street and ran into our server and treated her to a drink for a good night's service. I loved it so much I took several business cards for reference and to give to friends/family. Bon Appetitto!!!", "business_id": "fy8ssAoDOOtg3Y2iqfMHSQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-25", "type": "review"}
