They were very great in seating us in a large room separate from the rest of the restaurant. The service was also very good, the waiter was patient with all of us. As for the food, I started out with the curry mussels, they were by far the best thing I had at the restaurant. The sauce was really delicious and savory. I actually kept the sauce to dip my naan in later. My main meal was chicken tiki, which was just okay. Normal Indian food. However, some of my friends dishes were less than spectacular. I tried a shrimp dish that was so over cooked I could barley swallow the shrimp. The lamb was also way over cooked. Overall, I might return to this place. Its a little expensive for Indian food but certainly not unreasonable.", "business_id": "KK-6rXbIo9B4-b_P5WO5Qg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-07", "type": "review"}
