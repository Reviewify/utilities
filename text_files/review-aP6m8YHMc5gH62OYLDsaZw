Sure.. the square is dead aside from business hours where the local office workers on lunch keep it lively but honestly, that's not a reason to keep such crappy hours. They are pretty much only opened for breakfast and lunch. And that is a shame considering the way array of food that they have there. It's actually quite unique: they have stands: a salad one, a rice  bowl one, a pasta bowl one and a sandwich one. Oh and yeah, the crepe one. Depending on what you want to eat you wait in line in the stand where they custom make your food on to order and then you pay and enjoy it.\n\nI've actually tried a few items there, from the pasta and rice bowls to the sandwiches and the crepes. They taste decent although I think that they are way too expensive for what they are. The whole place is a ripoff. I had lunch there with my girlfriend, and we each had a so-called entree and a drink and it cost me over $20. Sacristy I say!\n\nThe service is kind of slow, especially since they cook everything to order in their \"stands\" so if your in a hurry, I'd head over to Cosi next door. I had to wait like 25 minutes in line and then another 10 while my food was cooking to order. It's kind of annoying and the portions aren't the typical bang for the buck.\n\nIt's a fun place to try, one in a while I guess. The atmosphere is pretty cool and they have windows everywhere which helps cure winter depression!", "type": "review", "business_id": "c577WXP83PAcIyDiaCtrDQ"}
