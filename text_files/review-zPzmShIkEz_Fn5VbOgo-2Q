If you look, I wrote a bad review at the 72nd street location, which I still stand by fully.  I swore off Cohens, but they have this city on lock and are like the starbucks of optometry.  Thus, when I needed glasses and with my sucky-ass vision insurance benefits in hand I went to..ugh..COHENS!\n\nI like this location better.  They are more friendly than the 72nd location and better to work with.  Yes, it's a Cohens still, but everyone knows its overpriced.  I liked the sales people here better.  They were friendly.  When I was glasses shopping, I felt like the girl was able to understand what kinda of model I was looking for.  She was slightly pushy with the financing option, but overall backed off once she saw my tentacles growing out of my arm to body slam the bitch.  \n\nPlus, a few times I had to go in to get my glasses resized and they did it quickly and efficiently.  So, this makes me a happy-enough consumer.  \n\nSo, if you have to go to Cohens, go to this location.  Not 72nd street.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sR69be9vQIWj1sZ55DNAjQ"}
