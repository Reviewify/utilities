I was so looking forward to the visit and even \"bragged\" about my past experience.  Well, I ordered the Ahi Tuna burger with Hawaiian BBQ sauce and Avocado.  The only part that was good was the avocado.  I should have sent it back, but I just ate my side item instead.  My burger was a barely seared mash of chopped Ahi.  I was not looking to eat sushi for lunch, and that it was it looked like.  It was cold in the middle and did not look good.  The BBQ sauce was just that, BBQ Sauce.  I did have the Loaded Tots which were delicious.  The sides did get smaller though.\n\nSo, I did not order one of the slushies, but from my friends who did, they said that they were both watered down.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the chocolate covered strawberry that the Manager gave me.  Delicious!\n\nI love the staff and the food at Park 75, so this must have been \"one\" of those days.  \n\nMaybe next time I will just dine in the restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tbfbSDu347UPplagdAVuIw"}
