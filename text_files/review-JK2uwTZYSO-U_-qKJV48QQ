She is pleasant, knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to refer me to an ophthalmologist when she saw something that concerned her.  \n\nNow Dr. Berkowitz does talk fast and seems to be impatient, but I have learned that really is just her personality.  As when my daughter was trying to start on contacts, she let my daughter doing it in her office about 4 times for hours and was really great about it.\n\nI don't know what people are referring when they say she doesn't have modern equipment, because I actually go to here because she can do a computer eye test that many opticians don't have.\n\nAnd when I asked here where I could get higher grade lenses than what was sold next store, she  referred me to multiple stores that sold premium progressive lenses.\n\nI have been to Dr Hu also and she is clearly an extraordinary nice person with a nicer looking office.  But my exams with Lisa were more thorough and significantly cheaper (I don't care, but if you had 3 kids you might), so if you want the better exam go to Dr Berkowitz.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KriradD8Bn_NvVQec84Hkw"}
