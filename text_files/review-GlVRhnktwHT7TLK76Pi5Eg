I've tried falafel at most sandwich places in Boston, and this place did not dissappoint. A lot of falafel sandwiches are served with hummus, which tends to steal the spotlight from the actual falafel. This once is served with lettuce, tomato, pickles and a light tahini sauce that makes it fabulous. So much food for $5, which is not easy to come by in Harvard Square. It's become my go-to place for a delicious, cheap lunch. The staff has always been very friendly. Yayyyy Middle Eastern food!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YeRXjIzxc9FaK6uyrTBvkQ"}
