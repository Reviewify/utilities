Went to Bubble House tonight with some friends because they had a coupon. The bubbles were stale (like they were the other week, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt that time), the food was blah, the server was blah, and they didn't have about half the menu in stock. The food we did order was cheap. I shared the Red Coconut Curry with shrimp with a friend and there were three shrimp. Three. In a large bowl with tons of rice and soggy lettuce swimming in the curry. Ew. Why wouldn't the rice come on the side? There was a dispute about the validity of the coupon and the waitress told us it wasn't valid, but it was supposed to be valid for a year from the purchase date, etc. Annoying.", "business_id": "8Wq0LZSuHdPTlleQD5sU_w", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-01-24", "type": "review"}
