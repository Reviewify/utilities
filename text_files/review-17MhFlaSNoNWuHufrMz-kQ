I guess the word adequate comes to mind...  \n\nWhich is a shame, because walking past the storefront in Harvard Square, it seems as though it has SO much potential.   It's not exactly the neighbourhood full of the hippest joints in town, but Tory Row looks pretty cool from the outside with its minimalist navy frontage: you feel like it's a place for the beautiful people.\n\nUnfortunately it's let down by the food and service, not the clientele or decor.  I ordered the lobster salad and my friend ordered the veggie burger, and like I said they were adequate: not good, not bad.  The real WTF moment came when our order of broccoli rabe appeared.  Just to be clear: I am a big fan of broccoli rabe, in fact, broccoli is definitely on my top 5 list of vegetables.  Sadly, this one smelt-and tasted- like it had been steeped in sulphur.\n\nMy friend was brave enough to take a bite and immediately regretted that decision.  We finally got the attention of the waitress and explained that it seemed like there was something wrong with the rabe.  Her unenthusiastic response was \"A lot of people really just don't like the broccoli rabe.\"  She removed the offensive item from the table but failed to remove it from the bill.  \n\nHere is my question - if \"a lot\" of customers are complaining about the item then why is it still on the menu and how are you still charging people $4 for it??  Boo to Tory Row for poor service, mismanagement of the menu and for trying to poison customers with questionable vegetables...!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A"}
