The place was rather empty, and only slightly filled up come 12:30p. I was rather distracted by good company, but here is what I remember of the place.\n\nTons of windows created a light-filled, welcoming ambiance... wooden everything (including bar area) and natural plants spread about. Waiter was present and attentive - drinks were fast and refilled regularly; appetizer came first; plates were cleared as we finished; and all the while I only noticed him once or twice. \n\n3 out of 4 dishes were cleaned up and/or taken home - a seafood/pasta mix, a pizza, and a chicken panini. Moderate prices for an Italian lunch - $9-13 for a sandwich or pasta.\n\nWould not hesitate to go again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uirnfa_m6ITWKMN2JBLHvQ"}
