In other words, it took me four years to eat here. The Spicy Lamb Bolognese is great! I didn't expect to like it so much but it was perfectly seasoned and I loved the whipped basil ricotta. I think White Dog as a whole is a bit too expensive for the average college student, but it would be a nice place (on campus!) to take your parents for dinner if they were to visit.", "business_id": "ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-02", "type": "review"}
