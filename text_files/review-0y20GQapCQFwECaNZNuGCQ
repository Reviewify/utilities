Their chai goddess is what got me addicted to chai in the first place!  \n\nThe monkey mocha diva is also pretty awesome.  And the honey latte.  Well, everything really.  These are absolutely the sweet and creamy type of coffee drinks, but don't be fooled... the advantage that they have on everyone else in this business is that they don't leave out the good, strong coffee.  If you're ever having trouble deciding (it's a big menu, after all), just ask the barista what they recommend, or go with the posted special.  You won't be let down.", "type": "review", "business_id": "trjl04ZqxZOyazhgcJecPQ"}
