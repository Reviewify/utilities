Call me crazy, but I actually think it may be my favorite (even topping Methodist...?). It still only gets three stars because 1) it is, after all, a crowded, overpriced hospital cafeteria, and 2) the ambiance is terrible (it's in the basement, meaning no windows, no cell reception, and no escape from that ubiquitous scorched food/cleaning liquid scent). Also, the prices have continued to climb over my time at medical school, and lunch now runs at $6-8, which is not exactly cheap.\n\nHowever, the food is decent, in my experience. I would say the cafeteria has a soul food/southern food bent (although it certainly has the standard salad bar, pizza stand, and sushi cabinet that most places do). Even the Chinese food makes me think of the rodeo. I have to specifically mention the sweet potato pon (don't think about the butter in it) and the fish (which has always been good when I've had it, whether fried, blackened, or baked). I also am a fan of the soft serve machine. But, then again, I've never met ice cream I didn't like...", "type": "review", "business_id": "P8fyFwD9P7fdhh96cStoMg"}
