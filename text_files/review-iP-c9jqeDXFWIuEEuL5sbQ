Allied Arts is such a beautiful, peaceful haven and to have lunch there is a real treat.  I have known Cafe Primavera for years as I have used them for all kinds of catering.  They are the best- food, decor, staff- cannot get anything better.  I would not hesitate to invite friends for lunch at this gorgeous venue- you will not be disappointed!  I love, love, love their food!!", "business_id": "DTwNhYuDQzyGvUHysBk_4Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-16", "type": "review"}
