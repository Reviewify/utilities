The only thing about it ,was there really isn't anywhere to go AFTER this place.  It is two long bars split in half, and a small outdoor patio. Everyone we talked to in this place while we were looking for places to live said do not live here in Westwood as there are only two bars to go to.  The bartenders are very nice and the drink prices are average.  It seemed like a lot of UCLA students were there, at least the ones we talked to.", "business_id": "Z6gj3H0r5kMkGYu_gqlDVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-04", "type": "review"}
