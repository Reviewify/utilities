Not only has it been almost three years since I've reviewed it, but the CLP has done some serious renovations over the past few years. How could I, a bibliophile (thanks to my librarian mother) who uses the library regularly, have been so remiss? \n\nSo my sister-in-law called me up and asked me if I'd like to take my niece Allison to the library today to help with a project on Mark Twain. Would I?! Are the Beach Boys over the hill?  Does Ticketmaster still rip people off?  Did Steinbeck and Dickens write good books?  Asking me to help someone find a book is like asking an etymologist to find words.  Allison's at the age now where she's using the adult section.\n\nWe also saw a fine program today, \"Hurricanes, Lightning and Tornadoes, Oh my!\" featuring Dennis Bowman from KDKA-TV.  He gave several weather related demonstrations including how tornadoes are formed and how weather balloons work.  \n\nWho says libraries are obsolete?", "type": "review", "business_id": "FzjluWtXjZqcfXGIrGmVJQ"}
