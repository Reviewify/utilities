Good, but not great. They do double-fry the wings and french fries, and the buffalo sauce was of high quality. The burger had the texture of play-doh. They only have one flavour of wings. I think it would be great food if you were already drunk, but they don't serve beer here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Il2csF4ZapaWAkQlFSyPTg"}
