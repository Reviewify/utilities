It's expensive, but the pizza is huge. It always has interesting specials, but sometimes it's hard to get what you want. I'm on the fence, so I'm going with three stars. I've only ever had pizza and salad there, so maybe I should try something new for a better palate judgment. At the same time, the salad I had was awful and I usually have ghetto belly after eating Fellini. There have been a couple of times when my boyfriend and I have tried to order a certain type of pizza or salad and it's been out. One time they ran out of lettuce at 8:00 on a Thursday night. How does that happen? I also have a problem with the service. Whether I call for delivery/pick up, or if I'm at the counter ordering, I always feel as though I'm being talked down to. I don't like that, and I think it's unnecessary. It also makes for a less pleasant eating experience overall. But the highlights are how massive the pizza is, and how many different toppings there are. They always have new specials that you can order by the slice, which is awesome and a nice change from the typical pepperoni or cheese slice. On the flip side, a typical slice of pepperoni or cheese should always be available for those less daring, and there have been numerous times I've gone in and that hasn't been an option. And who wants to pay $20 for a cheese pizza? No thanks. I'll keep going to Fellini, but probably only if I have a massive crowd to please and we're not yet drunk enough to order from Dominos.", "business_id": "xsciMH9Wvl6o3sUdCsz8gw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-16", "type": "review"}
