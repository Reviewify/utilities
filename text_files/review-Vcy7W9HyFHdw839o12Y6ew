Cozy venue. Real music's last stop where anything can be tried and heard. I saw a duo tribute to Simon & Garfunkel performed by A.J. Swearingen & Jonathan Beedle. Not a terribly big fan to S&G (before my time) but they were excellent to the classics of S&G. This was a pleasant surprise. I gave a bit to the Ark too. It is a non-profit joint. Must find a way to revisit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ot7LlNNnR2nbdb0zfOF6IQ"}
