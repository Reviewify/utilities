I've come on numerous occasions.  Even my (omnivorous) family loved this place.  The bakers are very friendly and accommodative.  Once I placed an order the night before an event for two dozen cinnamon role cupcakes and they were able to prepare them by 9am the next morning.  I would highly recommend Cinnaholic to anyone and everyone.", "business_id": "2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}
