This review is for their party delivery option. Thanks to a recent Groupon, my office decided to see if we could addict the remaining fifty percent of non-frozen-yogurt eaters by bringing in Pinkberry. The entire process was incredibly easy and Pinkberry contacted us several times to let us know of snags in the process - first the manager of the Back Bay store to let us know that he had transferred our order to the Harvard Square store, then the Harvard Square store manager to discuss some issues with the flavors to use. Delivery was fast and efficient, products were already put into covered cups (which was great for sticking them in the freezer for latecomers), and they left the ice for us to use in a (vain) attempt to prevent any melting from occurring before the hordes of the office could descend.", "business_id": "eyYc64obC0oY0Gk17PgpQg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-12", "type": "review"}
