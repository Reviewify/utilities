Definitely your experience here will depend on who you get, and unfortunately I got the old lady hairdresser. She kept cutting it, looking at it with uncertainty, and even tried straightening it. I never straighten my side bangs! I just let them fall into place after blow drying. Anyways, my bangs are a big deal to me. Just don't go to this lady for a bangs trim! :]", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mw_IkXUlEWhcnT8UEuIViw"}
