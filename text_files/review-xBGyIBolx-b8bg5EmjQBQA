Best Yet gets it right for the neighborhood- high quality, fresh produce for a good value, an affordable market brand, plus organic and other high end product for customers who want it. I love to cook food from most world cultures, and can find everything I need at Best Yet. And in my household I have vegetarians and gluten-free eaters, Best Yet has a good selection for everyone. Like most NYC stores, the layout is awkward, and the lines can be long, but the staff are always very courteous and efficient. Plus- ready made food, great deli, cheeses and the bakery! And I'm not even going into the beer- the largest craft beer selection in Manhattan!", "business_id": "3dyxUo0nT31VTwEaOp2CYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-02", "type": "review"}
