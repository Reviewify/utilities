The beer is okay, but nothing phenomenal.  The food is generic Chilis-esq food.  The crowd tends to be 20 year old boys trying to scope out the non-existent female crowd.  Not worth checking out.\n************************************************************\nOkay, I HAD to drop it another star after last night.  I'm not sure if I've ever had service this bad at a restaurant.  We show up, sit down and get our menus.  My friend gets up to use the restroom and while she's the gone the waiter asks if I know what I want to drink.  I tell him that my friend is in the restroom and I'm not sure what I want and as I'm telling him that I want the hef, he walks away not listening.\n\nAlmost 10 minutes pass before he comes back to get our drink orders.  \n\nAnother 7 minutes pass before he brings her the water she asks for.\n\nAnother 5 minutes pass before I get my beer.  Now, let me pause and tell you about this beer.  I'm not beer snob, but I do like beer to resemble beer.  This showed up looking like a soda.  Seriously, most sodas don't have this much carbonation.  I actually thought it was one of those bubble glasses where they have bubbles put into the glass as decoration.  Nope, the entire beer is so bubbly (but not foamy) that I was more than a little confused.  And usually the beer was decent, but I barely even finished this one.\n\nMoving on.  After he brings us our drinks, he disappears for another 10 minutes.  He finally walks by again and I flag him down.  \"Oh, did you want food?\" he asks in a bored way.  Ummmm, perhaps us staring at the menus for the last 30 minutes could've been a clue!  So we order.\n\n20 minutes later, he notices that another friend has joined us and asks if he wants a drink.  My friend orders a water.  The waiter fails to ask him if he wants a menu.  \n\n10 minutes later, he shows up with the other water.  And we have another guest.  Completely ignores him and tell us that our food will be just out.\n\n10 minutes later, I get my sandwich and she gets her pizza.  The food is fantastic.  Puts me in a better mood, and I'm willing to forgive him.  But then I notice that all 3 (umm, there's four of us at this table) of our drinks are empty.\n\n15 minutes later he stops by to check on us and I ask for a water, as does my original friend.  The third guy was in the restroom, but his glass was clearly empty and the fourth guy didn't even have a drink, but nevertheless it didn't dawn on him to refill/offer drinks.  Also, the water took about 5 minutes get.\n\nThe boys left and my husband shows up to take their place.  He gets a beer menu, but no food menu.  It takes 5 minutes to just get a menu.  So he orders.  And my friend orders the sweet potato chips since they sound interesting.\n\n15 minutes later, the food shows up, as does my husband's beer.  (His beers both fared much better, so I'm assuming there was something just wrong with the hefs that night.)  We eat and notice that the chips are definitely not sweet potato, but are just regular chips and we as him about it.  His response was, \"What are you gonna do?\"  \n\nWe finally pay (and luckily he got our tickets correct) and leave as fast as possible.  We spent over 3 hours there and most of it was due to the incompetence of the waiter.  My husband was surprised we were still there (and was hoping we'd be done so he could get better food) and after he got there, he understood why.  \n\nFrom what I could tell, the other waiters were all pretty slow too, but not to this extent.  Another group that came in the same time we did got there food and that table rotated 3 other parties before we left.  That is not right.  \n\nI definitely would think twice before coming here.  Black Walnut downstairs is much better, as is Kubos across the way.  I've heard amazing things about the Indian place, but can't vouch for it myself.  Really, really disappointing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1jf4fZV8IdsRy9yjhAix9w"}
