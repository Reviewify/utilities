By \"corporate,\" I mean that it has more than a couple of stores open around here. Not Starbucks corporate, but corporate enough for some. I have to say, I love getting a seat at the window and staring out at people who walk by. The service is always really good, the people here are nice, and they have a bathroom, which is rare for Berkeley. I've only had iced drinks here, but they are really really good. Again, the location is key here, because the building is situated on a corner with a great view and almost no building obstructions, so you get a great panorama. Outdoor seating is average, three tables in the middle of the sidewalk. What else? They still have a bit of that independent coffee place atmosphere, and they play classical music!!! I love it. One star off for the bathroom being all messed up, because they seem to be much more lax now about the customer only usage. Also, the table space outside is a bit lacking.", "business_id": "Ojj7Eb6gxtZ_X5g2oQuoOg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-01", "type": "review"}
