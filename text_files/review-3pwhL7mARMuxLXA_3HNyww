I can't fully love anything that reminds me of Appleby's. Boring lay out and seating doesn't do it for me. Now the desserts - yes they are yummy, but not the best bakery I've ever been to. I will give it points for variety of options and efficiency of servers. If you bring me a chocolate cake from Finale, I won't complain, but I'll feel a lil sorry for you that you overpaid.", "business_id": "8V1ceChgSzcGUV6jC8CvyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-19", "type": "review"}
