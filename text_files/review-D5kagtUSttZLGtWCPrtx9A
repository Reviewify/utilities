The pineapple curry is AMAZING - definitely recommend getting that. It's sweet but somehow spicy and fruity, all together! the ginger chicken isn't half bad either, but nothing phenomenal. For the prices, it's a good deal on thai food. the wait can be excruciating, so be prepared.", "business_id": "h11Hr07ffM-dn-rico0_fA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-31", "type": "review"}
