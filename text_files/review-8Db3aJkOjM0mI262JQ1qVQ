The sandwiches don't look big, but trust me when I say they are filling. I got the roast beef on dutch crunch and it was satisfying. My friend ordered the Chicken Pesto Panini, and he said it was a bit on the salty side...so maybe stick with the cold sandwiches.\n\nEverything here looks and tastes fresh. It's close to campus as well so that's convenient. The people working there are also very cordial.\n\nIf you're craving a sandwich for a cheap price I'll point you in Cheese N Stuff's direction", "type": "review", "business_id": "o0KC5k-7fXH8LHf75Icfuw"}
