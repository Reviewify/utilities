If a Tambor Party is what you'll be going to 595 North for - you can forget about wanting to sit down. The music was so awesome I didn't take the time to go on a tour of the venue. I was there for one reason - to cut the rug, to shake a tail feather; in other words - to dance! From what I could see from where I danced; it looked like a pretty trendy place. It's nice and spacious lots of room for dancing, spinning, whirling, dippin' and flippin'. Tambor the spanish word for \"drum\" is a perfect definition for such a party. The guest DJ for this event, one Culoe de Song from South Africa who drove the beat all night long; well...until 3am, which could have easily gone on until sunrise and the crowd would have kept dancing and being moved by the music which was hypnotic - once it grabs you - it never lets go. It's the kind of music I'd danced to on the boardwalk at Coney Island all last summer. I found it to be euphoric - dancing on and on to a syncopated rhythm. If the music doesn't move you - you simply do not have a soul. It was so amazing, afterwards, people stood around outside talking about it and I heard things like: \"Girl, you sure got your dance on!\" \"It did my soul good, that's my church.\" \"Girl, you look like you just got out of a shower!\" So, no matter what kind of party or event going on at 595 North...I'm willing to bet money nothing's got it going on like a Tambor Party.", "business_id": "A5c_J0JsVCUrnmu4j0FwIA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-20", "type": "review"}
