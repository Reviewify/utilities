The prices are cheap, but the quality of the food leaves something to be desired.  I've had much better (and I mean much much better) sushi at other places that are just as cheap as Tako (Manpuku, Geta).  The Miso soup was probably the most disappointing part of it. The service though was the worst part.  The place was pretty empty when my friend and I were there and yet it still took forever for the waitress to come over to our table. I'm never coming here again.  I almost contemplated giving it two stars because of the cheapness of the sushi, but then I decided that was too generous.", "business_id": "2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-28", "type": "review"}
