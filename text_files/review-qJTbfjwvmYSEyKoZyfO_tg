They are incredibly delicious. I like the red velvet, pumpkin, and black&white. Those are my favorite cupcakes.  My sister tells me that the place is always packed. The owners are strict about keeping the doors closed. So only like two people can come in at a time if there is a long ass line. A great dessert place. My sister goes once a month and brings me back a cupcake :-)", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-08", "type": "review"}
