I do a lot of online shopping and they make it very easy with returns/exchanges. Not as much traffic as the one in Galleria. Also, they have a furnishing/decor section which the Galleria doesnt. However, Galleria's sale section is much much larger than this one. \n\nIf you've never been to Urban Outfitters in general, they sell hip, vintage, over-priced clothing (that I give in to buying..) and a bunch of novetly items. Definitely a great place to stop by for gift shopping. The material of their apparel is a hit or miss. Sometimes its nicely made and other times I find my pieces falling apart after a couple of washes. Shoes aren't that great either; style is cute, what they do to your feet isn't. \n\nTip from an ex-employee: Items that are on the floor usually will be moved into the sale section within two weeks. It really depends on how popular the item is, but most pieces do.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wb3iHGk2gqMsK7pH017pCw"}
