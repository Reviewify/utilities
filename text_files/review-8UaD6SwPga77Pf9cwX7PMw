I was always too afraid of being caught (or spotted by my parents and/or one of their friends, who always seemed to catch me when I was somewhere I wasn't supposed to be. remind me to tell you the story about the time my dad found out I was at a Princeton University party at 4am because apparently one of HIS friends was there.............) so I never went. until a few years ago when I met up with a former classmate to have drinks and catch up on life. Decent dive bar, I remember there being a relatively good selection of beer. Staff was..........well, virtually non-existant, mostly because it was (i think) the day after Christmas, but nice enough. Pool table maybe? God, I'm senile. can't remember now. I usually choose not to go drinking in Princeton to avoid running into people I know (i hate those \"OMG how have you been????\" conversations, especially since I left school mid-senior year and to this day, apparently people think i was in jail or got knocked up and sent away. ugh) but the Ivy is a decent place to grab a few rounds.", "business_id": "0AG93DSyGOrpUsx6NV-zqA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-02", "type": "review"}
