I had never had takoyaki and was only vaguely aware of what it was.  But, fried octopus balls sounded, shall we say, intriguing.  Love Balls' takoyaki is exactly as advertised.  Fried to a crunchy crisp on the outside, but immediately gooey and battery inside.  And then you reach the succulent octopus, which is chewy and briny and delicious.  I ordered mine Ponzu style with marinated bean sprouts, which provided a nice, sour, crisp counterpoint to the savory takoyaki.  In my highly scientific estimation, I believe that Love Balls might be the perfect post-bar-hopping food.  I will need to test this.", "business_id": "8SqxzaPVVBTIxrbJKZwDxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-23", "type": "review"}
