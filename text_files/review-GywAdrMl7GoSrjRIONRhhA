And of course, Gather. I had the great privilege of dining here with two dear friends recently. The space is an unusual shape-sort of a half circle, with natural earth tones, medium wood tables and light airy metal light fixtures throughout. Regular and sparkling waters are served in upcycled Strauss milk bottles and the servers are incredibly friendly, genuine and can offer great suggestions on portion size and favorite dishes. We shared the gently sweet stone fruit green salad and a smoky and crispy pancetta pizza with a thin crust and two fried eggs on top. Sheer heaven. Our sweet tooths lead us to split a chocolate almond torte, gluten free, with a healthy dollop of whip cream and macerated strawberries. My kind friends let me take home the leftover pizza which I enjoyed for quick snack/lunch. Memories flood back to a beautiful day spent with truly sweet and generous people. Gather your dearest and closest family and friends and try. You'll be pleased you did. PS Make reservations. It fills up quickly. A seasonal menu too. Gather and nourish.", "business_id": "BiZAzf2SAFCE0gJrX-PGFw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-29", "type": "review"}
