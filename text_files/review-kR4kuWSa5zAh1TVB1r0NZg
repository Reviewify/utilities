Kosmo has a very unique steampunk, post-industrial style to it that not only charms, but really feels warm... in a post-apocalyptic, nuclear holocaust sort of way. The food itself, albeit derived from relatively basic cooking technique, is extremely satisfying. While the Bi Bim Bop might be most appealing (it is a Korean grill anyways!), I highly recommend the vegetable fried rice, which has an otherworldly fried quality to it, actually imparting a highly desirable crunchy texture to the rice. Either way, no dish at Kosmo is complete without compliments of the house version of the traditional Gojujang-derived Korean hot sauce which is most typically served with Bi Bim Bop (I use it on all dishes at Kosmo). Their version is something I dream about at night, I have spent hours thinking about ways to replicate this highly endearing hot sauce which has a very noticeable sweet side to it, but is just the right hotness. Don't forget to add an amazing egg roll to your meal, they're super unique - filled with kim chi! All in all, I have never been disappointed with an experience at Kosmo. The staff is always very helpful and kind (as long as you are!).", "business_id": "18NlgiRTcSo4NNsM_xs-OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}
