I have a long history of volunteering/working with libraries all over the country and this is one of the better funded branches I've come across in my travels. In the past few weeks I've had no problem getting my book fix here and I don't think I'll run out of choices any time soon. That said, I was a little ticked off at first that they wouldn't give me a library card even though my license said I lived in Chapel Hill... Despite the fact they are called the Chapel Hill Public Library, in actuality they are an Orange County Public Library, as that is how they determine free patrons. Anyway, I now live in Orange County so I use this branch regularly. Beware! If you put items on hold and expect to be emailed, their email system seems to get spam blocked by lots of email services. Make sure you add 'library at townofchapelhill dot org' to your whitelist. I just want to share one other thing... my wife came up with an awesome idea of cycling our coffee table books with interesting selections from the library. Not only are we keeping our living room interesting, but we're also promoting the local library to our friends. We get great feedback about this so give it a try yourself!", "business_id": "kUUX9uhZk9Ux204_4SNqJQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-29", "type": "review"}
