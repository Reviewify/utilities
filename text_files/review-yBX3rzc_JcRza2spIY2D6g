They tend to be closed a fair amount and it's not announced or mentioned on their website, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a website.  During the summer and winter holidays from school, it seems like they are closed more often than not.  I only mention this because (due to all the glowing reviews) I have tried to eat there at least 7 times and only been successful twice due to them being closed. The entrees are good and the sauces are tasty.  Prices are a little on the high side to me - some of the meat dishes have so many vegetables it seems almost like filler.  I would like it if some of the dishes or sauces were a bit more heavily spiced, though.  For comparison, Empire and Woori Jib are a bit cheaper.  It's about the same price range as Golden Harbor and definitely faster, but I've never been blown away by a dish here like I have been at Golden Harbor. So that's pretty much it.  For campus, a little expensive.  It works if you really want an on-campus Chinese fix, and it is better than Cravings or Bo-bo China.  If you are meeting someone here, I'd call first to make sure they are actually open.", "business_id": "jKxES7iLV63H_PfyGVGIDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-19", "type": "review"}
