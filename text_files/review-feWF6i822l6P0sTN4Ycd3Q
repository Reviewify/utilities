There's a giant list of toppings, many of which are atypical.  My boyfriend and I went with a 12\" pie with all our favorite stuff on it: sweet potatoes, dried cranberries, caramelized onions, bacon and mozzarella.  We got the rosemary sauce, and at first I didn't think it really went with the toppings we picked, but I changed my mind as we ate.  The crust was extremely thin, but not at all cardboardy like some thin crusts: it was actually very light.  The mozzarella is extremely high-quality, creamy and fresh.  None of this part-skim nonsense.  Yet the pizza wasn't the slightest bit greasy.  I don't know whether Emma's would fulfill my run-of-the-mill pizza cravings, but it was definitely delicious and I'm sure we'll be back.\n\nBy the way, the 12\" ended up being the perfect size for the two of us, but we're not very big eaters.  If we'd been super-hungry, we might have wanted an appetizer too.  My only complaint is that our server was apathetic to the point of being rude.  She really seemed miserable.  I mean, when you come over and reach across the table to pick up my water glass, fill it up, and then plop the glass down on the edge of the table with your back to me while walking away... well, it doesn't give me the warm fuzzies.  I'm just sayin'.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7bYE2n75faWu_OjzxD0l0w"}
