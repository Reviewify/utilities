I maybe picky but I like my food hot and fresh.  When I ordered my slumdog dosa, I was handed my dosa right away.  If I wanted something prepackaged, I would have gone to Fresh and Easy (corporate plug of the day).  Aside from that, it was bland.   The samosa  was yummy though and made up for the dosa, but this is called the Dosa Truck so that cannot be forgiven. 2 stars for YOU!", "business_id": "NtyjXKWUH_Lc0XEbxhp_1g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-25", "type": "review"}
