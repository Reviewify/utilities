I was surprised at how big the place is. The parking lot was full but I got lucky enough to find street parking. This place includes the bowling alley, arcades upstairs, pool tables, and a bar. We hung out at the bar the entire night. Lisa M created a playlist and the DJ played all the songs on her list. It was a good place to hang out. There isn't alot of variety at the bar and the food lacked some salt and pepper but overall we had fun. The staff was very nice. I would definitely like to go back.", "business_id": "fGawcocJqcj3wXjHj7YXAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-07", "type": "review"}
