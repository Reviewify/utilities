PROMISE you won't regret it...just make sure you work out afterwards...it's extra greasy, hey if you gonna have a FAT day might as well go all out right? LOL oh also go at night, that's when i go it's better it's something about the ppl that make it durning the day...i like food that is prepared with love not like, and at night they make it with love. They also always give me a slice that comes out of the oven and let me choose my slice. : )", "type": "review", "business_id": "WqAtgHTxgS-B8J6iHc4eeA"}
