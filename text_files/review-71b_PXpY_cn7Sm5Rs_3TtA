I had the veal chop special and it was absolutely divine -- we voted it the meal of the evening. The sides were good, but did not stand on their own. Appetizers varied from usual, to delicious (I got the smoked trout which was great).\n\nService was great, attentive. Wine was well priced and they had a good selection. Great night, great location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_qGDRfTvIwUqFtI1mGI8Rg"}
