Everyhting that I have had tastes great, big portions, good prices and the ingrediences are fresh.  Love the chips and salas.  Happy hour is great, the beers are cold and refreshing.  The staff is wonderful, very friendly and the place is always clean The music is always cute polka type music, puts me into a good spirit.  On Tuesdays during happy hour they have all you can eat tacos for $5.85 There record for eating the most tacos is 21, hmmmm...Nah I would not be able to eat more then 5, maybe? They have this item on the menu that I have not noticed before and I only have read the menu a zillion time, it is a must try the next time I go.  It is bacon wrapped prawns DEEP FRIED, with lots of veggies in a spicy sauce with cheese melted on top.  Comes with tortollas, rice, beans, sour cream and guac.  Let's just say  I will be bringing my flax seed oil with.  Oh and the other meats I have had always has a very good seasoning and is very tender.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZLbpGclbk8a-PSi1ocS-2A"}
