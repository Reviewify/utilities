It's quiet, attractive, and has a fountain out front. Parking is good. Breakfast is continental with hard-boiled eggs, Tazo teas, make your own waffles. There are always cookies and coffee in the lobby. Rooms have a decent-sized flat-panel tv and a DVD player. The lobby has a stand with an impressive number of recent and classic DVDs, for free use. Beds are a bit soft, but the hot water comes on quickly. Free wi-fi in the rooms. There's a computer for guests in the lobby, and they will print the first 5 pages free. Nice if you're checking in for a flight ahead of time. Across the street from the Apple Farm, and I think these rooms are nicer than AF. Our friend had a room at AF, and it was not conducive to work.", "business_id": "XAf56vWdymyvG-u6k9wqjw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}
