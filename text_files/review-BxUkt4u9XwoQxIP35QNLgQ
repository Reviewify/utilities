After sitting in the waiting area for 25 minutes I was taken into a room. The woman who would perform my massage told me to disrobe and place a sheet over myself -FINE- the sheet was actually half a sheet (barely covered me). I laid on the table but the opening for my face was so small I could barely breathe. I experienced one of the strangest massages ever (I have had Korean Spa experiences if you know what they entail!) At differing times I felt very exposed (buttocks or my leg would be placed in a position that pretty much inappropriate). A few day after my massage my back was hurting - I looked at it and I am covered with bruises - never have I gone ANYWHERE and gotten bruises from massages! Perhaps that is what I get for such a deal...... BUYER BEWARE!", "business_id": "WKc3yIQe55mj2ZWeKuWMJQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}
