I do recommend sharing if you're not that hungry.  \nThey are big and generous and very delicious.  I'm a vanilla fan and very satisfied.  The chocolate ones are delicious also.\n  I am on the email list and do appreciate the different ones they make for different holidays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
