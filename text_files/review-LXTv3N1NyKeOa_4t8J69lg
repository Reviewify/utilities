(Despite what my city says I am a born and bread Rhode Islander).  But, it is over a week since we went and I still can't so much look as an egg without my stomach turning.    Let me tell you that I love greasy spoons.  I will try anything.   We were going to go to our late night favorite (Olneyville System of course) but decided to save gas and revisit this Pvd standard.  This place is disgusting, inedible and expensive.    We were definitely a few drinks deep and couldn't even stomach more than a bite.  How do you ruin an egg and cheese sandwich (with bacon on it no less)????  My husband (he of the iron stomach) couldn't eat his burger.  Our fries tasted like fish, no matter how much vinegar and ketchup we put on the cover the flavor.   Save your money, your stomach and your ability to eat an egg, go elsewhere.  Oh and did I mention the unbelievable stink coming from my husband for hours after?", "business_id": "dQfvxeuNNqku7mozkk4Y3w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-11", "type": "review"}
