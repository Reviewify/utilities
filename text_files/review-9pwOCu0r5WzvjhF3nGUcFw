Upon arriving a group of women on the hotel staff rushed up to us as we were getting settled at the pool and told us we weren't allowed to be at the pool unless we were hotel guests. \n\nUm, wait what?\n\nI asked to speak to a manager and they directed me to a tightly wound little man named Brahm.  He was rude and uncaring about our concern. He completely dismissed us. \n\nFine if the pool chairs are only for hotel guests, but if you're HOSTING a POOL party, maybe put that on the invite.  It was too late for us to go to the Roosevelt, so we hit the beach.  Next year, I will buy my tickets for the Roosevelt WAY in advance, and I will never set foot in the W again.\n\nBurning bridges like that in this economy seems unwise to me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg"}
