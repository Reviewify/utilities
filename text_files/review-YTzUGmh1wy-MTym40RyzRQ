I get the chicken pita or the Greek Lady salad (with chicken). Their grilled chicken is just phenomenal. And the fries are good. The cheese fries not so good. They never put enough cheese on the fries and the cheese gets cold absurdly fast. But other than that just get to know your favorites and you're good. Don't leave off the tzaziki sauce on any pita. It's great. And the fries they put in the house gyro so good. Meals run about $10. Oh, and their chocolate cake is great. Best in the area.", "business_id": "ADe114o7Z4vb1O6HkM6YEA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-18", "type": "review"}
