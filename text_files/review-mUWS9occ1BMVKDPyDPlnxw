I'm a big meat lover, so Brazilian steakhouses are my #1 specialty! Unfortunately Bay Area has very few choice of good steakhouses. I was quite excited to find Pampas, so close in Palo Alto but  are you serious? Such a limited meat selection, service and I\"m sorry but I feel like I have a better variety in my fridge than in their salad bar.  I always justify the price to the quality of the food, for the price I pay here food should be significantly better.
