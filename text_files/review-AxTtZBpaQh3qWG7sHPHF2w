You know you are getting to be a local when you recognize places from being there before-- when it was called something else! I guess in this economy that's not too much to be proud of, but digressing..\n\nWalked into Publik a couple of Tuesdays ago for Trivia Night with a big group of friends. We were first seated upstairs, but then when we explained we were there for trivia, etc, hostess kindly moved us downstairs. Our group kept expanding though, so we kept moving tables until we ended up in the front corner table for 8. Hostess was very nice and smiled through this. Waiter was good looking and funny (plus points always!).\n\nWe basically just had drinks which were a little expensive but they have a good unusual selection, which I always appreciate. As Elaine mentioned-- Boddingtons, $4, I was there. We also ordered \"bread service\" which wasn't anything fabulous and I thought they should have just given that to us for free. \n\nI'd love to go on a date down there on a non-busy night to just have a couple of beers and maybe share a meal. I parked in my friend's garage this past time, so not sure how the parking situation around there would be for those without midtown garage hookups. Having the Fox next door is + for good atmosphere and \"Atlanta-ness\" but also - for jacking up parking prices in the vicinity.\n\nAs far as trivia, it was really fun and low-key, just a bunch of friends flexing their smarts... friendly competition with nearby tables was amusing as well. Definitely check it out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jqJ49WeQVYmkJkOj4VDF6Q"}
