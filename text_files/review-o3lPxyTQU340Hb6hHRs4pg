I tried their Apricot wheat and it was very tasty. The Blind Pig is a good place to go if you're trying to stay away from the college crowd. They have a nice outdoor seating area as well. My only small complaint was that they ran out of toliet paper in the women's bathroom. I used the unisex bathroom and the lock appeared to be having some trouble locking. Even though I locked it some drunk woman was able to power through the lock and nearly walk in on me.", "business_id": "yk3TyFAJ-KM70uGb-cyspw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-02", "type": "review"}
