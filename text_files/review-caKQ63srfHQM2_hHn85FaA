I've never found anything like it on the Westside. I am about to become a full-blown addict. So packed (every wall and stand crammed to the ceiling with samples) you'll probably have trouble squeezing in past the throngs of people and obscene amount of footwear. $5-10 can get you a pretty fancy pair of dress sandals, and I got an adorable pair of ankle boots for $15. If you care about the look more than the name on the insole (because I actually didn't even think to check), this is the best in West LA.", "business_id": "cEggqgThI0_Dsd4B9EmCiQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-05", "type": "review"}
