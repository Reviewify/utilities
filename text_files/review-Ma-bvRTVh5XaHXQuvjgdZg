Love the pepperoni and onion, the cheese and mushroom, or the deluxe. Always fast and friendly, and usually clean stores. The thin crust they use is delicious. there's the right amount of greasiness without worrying me about getting a heart attack. leftovers are amazing. garlic bread is a good side (so many delicious carbs!)\ni've heard tell the salads are good as well. Strombolis are a good choice if you're on your own for lunch and don't want to eat a whole pizza ( like i do...)\n\nand there's a little train at this location that delivers your drinks to you :) and pictures of the town that are like 20 years ago.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bxXX4CxK2lbDH_v9c8uQaw"}
