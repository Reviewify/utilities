They are always very confused and unable to answer questions about things they should know.. like \" can  we order food at the bar?\"\n- It takes a long time to get water, chips and salsa, or anyone to great you at your table.\n- food is very average. It does not stand out and delicious, inventive, or even good.\n-empty tables sit empty for a long time before they are bussed or re-seated.\ni would not recommend this place.\n i hope they improve", "type": "review", "business_id": "GI6-M1x1SW1MTXGC5fPbnQ"}
