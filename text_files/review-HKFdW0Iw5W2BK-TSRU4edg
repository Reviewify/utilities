I have been several times and I am sad to report it is just not very good. -The hostesses are the worst. They are always very confused and unable to answer questions about things they should know.. like \" can  we order food at the bar?\" - It takes a long time to get water, chips and salsa, or anyone to great you at your table. - food is very average. It does not stand out and delicious, inventive, or even good. -empty tables sit empty for a long time before they are bussed or re-seated. i would not recommend this place.  i hope they improve", "business_id": "GI6-M1x1SW1MTXGC5fPbnQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-06", "type": "review"}
