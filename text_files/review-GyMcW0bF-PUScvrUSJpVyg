And received a free green tea and edame thanks the check in deals :)...hooooray for yelp deals!!!! The food was reeeally good (i had salmon roll, albacore sushi, crispy rice w/spicy tuna, and unagi)...i ended up only spending around $20 AND i was surprisingly full. It wasn't really busy when we walked in so we got our food pretty quickly. The only real complaint i have is the parking...it was a nightmare getting out of the lot. Other than that, i just wanted to thank yelp for helping us find this delightful little sushi joint :)", "business_id": "QiiuqzcD4HUqYpKhhGXU6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-27", "type": "review"}
