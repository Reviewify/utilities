Also some people have said it's nice. i say it's alright. But not the best. Yes, it has my favourite boutiques and stores, but the whole atmosphere was dull. Also there's not really restaurants and places to eat. I prefer going to Union Square. Will I come back probably not only if i must. At least is has LACOSTE, I'm content because of that. I was expecting a Rodeo Drive type of area.", "business_id": "2oFme3IiUSSi0PdAJNBxwg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-17", "type": "review"}
