It's always a favorite when choosing a place for happy hour with ANYONE-be it a friend who you need catching up with or a group of co-workers looking to gossip about their work week-this place is IT!

It's that good.", "business_id": "YDD0n84xkd_nHmkmPorG5Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-24", "type": "review"}
