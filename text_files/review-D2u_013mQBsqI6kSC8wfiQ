Got the jerk chicken which was insane. Got the candied yams which where beyond insane.  Got some cornbread which was awesome (and they gave me like 1/4 a loaf). And I got the mac and cheese which was good, but not insane. \n\nOnce I go to more soul trucks I will adjust my rating, but for real this truck was beyond great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV130V7ArLHiNRtkCPbEMw"}
