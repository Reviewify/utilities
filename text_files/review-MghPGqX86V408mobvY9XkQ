I called and placed a take out order and was told I'd be called when it was ready. After 45 minutes had gone by I called to check on my order and was told it was ready and had been sitting out. When I asked why they didn't call me they said they wait at least an hour before calling.... this didn't make too much sense to me but I still asked the hostess who answered if my order would be hot or cold. She said she'd check on my order and came back to say it was fine. I walked promptly over to the restaurant picked up my order came back to eat it at my hotel and it was practically inedible. I had to force myself to eat it because everywhere else had closed. I really don't think this is the best policy regarding take-out orders and feel I should have been told the food was cold or the restaurant should have warmed it up or made a new one for me.", "business_id": "ttZRucfe1fcN_DX2ZGZ1Vg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-11", "type": "review"}
