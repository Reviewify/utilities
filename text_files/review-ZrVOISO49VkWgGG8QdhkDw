I went over the Thanksgiving weekend last year. I found the room to be large, the bedspreads nicer then the standard ones that most cheaper hotels have. The service was good.  The view wasn't great but this isn't\"t the type of hotel you go to for luxury.  Overall if you are looking for a good place to stay but not fancy perks, this is it.", "business_id": "KZYNSm2nk8SJApyqMUBPSw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-20", "type": "review"}
