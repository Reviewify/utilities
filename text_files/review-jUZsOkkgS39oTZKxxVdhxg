MISTAKE! First off, let's save phrases like \"best pizza in the city\" for places like Gramaldi's, Lombardi's, or Patsy's... ok? Second, there was nothing I liked about this pizza. I get that this is not coal or brick oven pizza, but not one thing on this whole pie was good. The doe/crust was bland, the pepperoni was garbage, the sauce... oh wait, there was barely any sauce on there to taste, unless you count pools of grease as sauce. The only reason this place has 2 stars is that the delivery guy was pretty fast and the pizza was still hot when it came. Other than that, I'll stick with the downtown pizzerias.", "type": "review", "business_id": "geTFpY84Tp-nVTXflnxtDA"}
