Nothing too special, but very nice and tasty!  Very chill and easy to have a conversation while relaxing and watching sports.  Will go back when I'm in town as they have an eclectic selection of bottled beers in addition to their hand-crafted in-house brews.  Read the menu and saw some plated dishes as I left which looked quite appetizing!  If the food is as good as it looked and sounded on the menu, my rating will definitely go up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-4ppieQivAHq4flJXwqy0g"}
