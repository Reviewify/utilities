The menu might have the same items, but they do NOT taste the same or even comparable.  If you want bi bim bap, please walk a couple blocks and pay two bucks more for Korea Tofu House.  We paid 7.99 for a fried egg and rice, because that's all I could eat.  There was mostly lettuce and crab with mayonnaise in my bowl.  Not good.\n\nThe fried rice dishes are OK at best, but much better fare can be found on the same block for the same price.  The california rolls were bad, too.  Way too much mayonnaise with diced crab, so we ended up taking it out and eating the rice and nori.  \n\nI ended up eating the miso soup and tea instead of the bi bim bap.  My boyfriend was hungry, so he ate the mayonnaise-doused rice and chicken fried rice plate.  He feels so sick now he can't get out of bed for dinner.\n\nThe worst part is that we loved the old Tokyo Garden. Sad to see it deteriorate, but you'll have to find a new place, as do we.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z7543gTRoewwvk72MwqvGg"}
