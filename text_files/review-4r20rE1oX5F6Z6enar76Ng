I was excited to check out the exhibits because I enjoy being all museum-y.  However, the night I went, the top floor was unavailable as they were in the process of setting up a new exhibit and the bottom floor just consisted of projectors whose images were now being projected on all the people standing in front of them.  I think that the museum store was more interesting than the \"exhibits\" on display.  The entertainment was really good but alot of people were just standing around looking awkward.  At least I was able to check out the photocopies of various old houston flyers as a waited almost an hour to purchase over priced alcohol.  It was alot easier to get the free vitamin water outside than buy drinks.  Seriously, I recommend bringing your own alcohol to this thing so you don't waste your time in line.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kaJbKJmdVYuzYyZeWr3YtA"}
