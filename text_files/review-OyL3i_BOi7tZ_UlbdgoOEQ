I went to UC Berkeley for 4 years of undergrad, and 2 more years of graduate school. I met my hubby here as well and he is still finishing up his PhD. We really love Cal and value our education here. The campus is beautiful and the national lab where we did our researches has a breathtaking view of the bay.  Sure classes were challenging and we missed countless hours of sleep time stressing over projects and exams. But college times were the best 4 years of my life. At Berkeley I met so many friends, and I cherish every moments we spent together in class, in the dorms, and at Saturday football games where we screamed our lungs out.  I'm proud to be a cal bear! Go bears!", "business_id": "0iSN6PgiXKP4oSVL037ATg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-19", "type": "review"}
