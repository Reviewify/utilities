But for calling themselves a \"dough shack\" the dough used in the calzone wasn't that great. It was very thin and didn't have a lot of flavor. It was covered in grease/dripped grease while eating, etc. They do have fried green beans, which were good. And they have 26 kinds of fountain soda, which is great.
