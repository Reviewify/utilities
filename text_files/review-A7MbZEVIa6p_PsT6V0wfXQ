It's a small storefront on the Ave, so they don't have the most stuff, however what they lack in quantity they make up for style. The store itself is very open, which is a nice departure from most of the clothing stores in the area which are cramped and poorly lit (think Buffalo Exchange). They do have a pretty decent variety, and I love how things are organized by color. Most of the stuff is very basic and simple but in a variety of rich hues. Great for work (when I worked at Cedars and could wear anything I wanted) and wardrobe basics that will last through the seasons. The customer service is great, too. I love to buy tops and shoes here. Everything is reasonably priced (especially the shoes on clearance, where you can find some great deals). Plus, I've had a lot of stuff from there for years and it's all still in great shape. Not cheap crap like you find at the mall (and also it's not in the mall, which is a plus in my book). It's cheaper and more approachable than Aprie, but nicer than the rest of the clothing stores on the Ave. Love it!", "business_id": "iO8TvNDXAQJlWvAHhDVqcA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-16", "type": "review"}
