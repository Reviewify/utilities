Go for a stroll down to the South Street Bridge on a clear night for one of the most-stunning (and accessible by foot) views of the cityscape.  From the footpath, there is a direct view of the Schuylkill river leading straight up to Center City, and the angle creates a pyramid-effect of architecture and light.  This view is best appreciated on foot, as the surface of the vehicle lanes is pocked like a mutant-waffle.  The vibrations from crossing on a bike produce a similarly beautiful, pixilated version of the panorama. With rumors of a potential reconstruction/complete renovation -- which would at least improve the situation for biking -- I hope the city maintains the stunning view!", "business_id": "N-R7te7N0wmyYlmNcGSNmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-25", "type": "review"}
