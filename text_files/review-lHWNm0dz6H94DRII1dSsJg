It is ice cream for grownups.  Sort of like an ice cream bar.  The flavors are complex and ever-changing.  Burnt caramel is tremendous if you are a fan of creme brulee.  The staff are knowledgeable, patient, and generally easy on the eyes.   Tip them well.  At one point Tosci's was serving a Sunday brunch that was phenomenal, and included baked goods from Petsi Pies.  The central square location has free WiFi, 'interesting' student art, and generally good music.   Most importantly, it is rare that this ice cream shop is over run with knee high screaming vermin with chocolate smeared from head to toe.  Something I, as a barren MILF, certainly appreciate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u1Xq93R4LQ2VV2hK8MK5Wg"}
