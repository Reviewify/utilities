That is, until I found (with a rather unpleasant and painful bite) a lovely piece of broken glass amid the saag paneer I usually love so much. The servers were apologetic but didn't really offer me anything other than a vague explanation that \"things get busy in the kitchen and stuff breaks\". Um, thanks? Maybe I should have been more belligerent and offended, but I didn't want to cause a scene. I really do like the food here and perhaps I can get over this experience enough to come back again. Shattered (get it? haha.) faith aside, they have a delightful variety of dishes with well flavored sauces and usually a delectable array of desserts. I'm particularly fond of their mango and rice puddings. They also always give me fresh roti when I ask, free of charge. In the end, I would still recommend Kalluri to people looking for a filling and relatively cheap casual lunch venue.", "business_id": "69pDmF3LElzNHk6xu-2R0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}
