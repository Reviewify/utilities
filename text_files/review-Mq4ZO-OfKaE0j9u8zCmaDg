See an almost exact replica of LBJ's Oval Office, information on the 207 pieces of \"Great Society\" legislation he passed, including Medicare, Medicaid, public broadcasting, environmental protection, the War on Poverty, education, and many, many others.  The Library talks extensively about the Vietnam years and the toll it took on LBJ, as well as the JFK assassination, and his family. They also have special exhibits -- when I visited, there was an exhibit on Walter Cronkite, which was spectacular! The best part? It's free admission and free parking! I hadn't been to the LBJ library in 30 years, but it was just as good today as I remembered when I was a little girl. Fantastic presidential library -- don't miss it!", "business_id": "qnJ8FQPgJ1Jq-3G9l1fB3A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-30", "type": "review"}
