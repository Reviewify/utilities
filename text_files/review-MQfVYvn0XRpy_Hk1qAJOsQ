We walked in without a rezzy, but there was no problem getting 2 of us seated. There was a nice buzz in the place, busy, but not insane. We started with the spring rolls, which were really tasty. The sauce was great, and the rolls were light and flavorful. The chicken pad thai was slightly underseasoned, but nothing a few extra squirts of lime juice and hot sauce couldn't fix. Spice was tasty, the best Thai in Harvard Square in my opinion (better than 9 Tastes for sure), but not quite to the level of the best Thai restaurants in town.", "business_id": "84-VYasaVm6zCDw3T_LfDg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-09", "type": "review"}
