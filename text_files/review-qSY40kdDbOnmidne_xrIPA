Since the change of management 2 or 3 years ago, their future doesn't look so bright. Actually, we just went there today for lunch and all three of us were disappointed. First of all, there was a greasy, musty smell and it was very stuffy, so we had to ask the waitress to turn up the AC. After that, we ordered. I got my wonton soup first and saw that there was a good amount of extra oil in there. I didn't have the broth after seeing that. Dad got General Tso's, his absolute fave Chinese dish, and was very distressed to see that the batter part of the chicken was very thick and there wasn't enough meat inside. Mom got shrimp fried rice and was also pretty crestfallen to see that there was a layer of oil sitting on top of the rice. Me? I got chicken and black bean sauce, which so far every Chinese restaurant has been able to make the right way. Almost every Chinese restaurant that is. I don't know what the chef was thinking, but the whole sauce seemed to come from a bottle of soy sauce, except for the black beans. No wonder there was a whole crowd at Tiger Noodles and we were the only people at Ivy Garden. Don't waste your money people. Go to Tiger Noodles where you can get some value for your money, and come home with a full, satisfied stomach.                                                                         -Isha Biswas, age 11", "business_id": "ypwAHNow4r90cVFNfDoVAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-04-01", "type": "review"}
