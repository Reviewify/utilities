The brisket was very tender and fall-apart-in-your-mouth type, perfect. Only having been open since February, I think this little place is making great strides, especially with Debbie's personality at the front of the store.  My only wish is for unlimited sauce and bigger portions for the price.  For $20, I can usually fill myself up at a BBQ restaurant, however, not this time!  As a BBQ-loving-American, I need to satiate my large appetite. Keep up the good work, Debbie (and brother, whom I have not met)!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-i3pCgQi_Y9NiSSWs6G7bw"}
