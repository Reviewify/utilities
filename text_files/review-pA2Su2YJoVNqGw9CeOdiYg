At first glance, the menu was great and all the food coming out looked brilliant.  They also had a nice selection of beers, including Irish cider on tap.  All good, right?  No.\n\nSadly we had a server who made it pretty clear to us that she had far, far better things to be doing than waiting on us.  Sure, it was a bit busy, but not so busy that it warrented that kind of attitude.\n\nFood was pretty good and I'd love to return to sample other things... but unfortunately the service experience will keep me from returning.  What a shame.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pW18p3XZrinTIDONZiBoig"}
