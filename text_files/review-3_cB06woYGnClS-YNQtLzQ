For Monday happy hour, the food is $5 and wine is half off.  Service can be slow and the wine is allright.  However, the food is excellent and can't be beat for the price. They also have a good selection of beers and the bread pudding dessert is awesome.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8polKN4I6fJx1t8pPxogVw"}
