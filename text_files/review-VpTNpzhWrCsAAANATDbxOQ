I have gone here twice, and both times were screwy! First time was for a wedding reception and they totally ignored us. The second time I went with my husband for our 4 year wedding anniversary, and it was the worst service. Obviously my rating is geared towards service. Food was great...but still like my steaks from Morton's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2LrIkZB7mOwu8-9OVhjWfQ"}
