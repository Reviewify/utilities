The first was on a date, the second with my parents.\n\nOn both occasions the food was delightful, the wine list extensive and of high quality, and the server perfectly likable and helpful. Of particular mention are the scallops, tuna and double-baked white chocolate cheesecake. Overall the menu is quite varied and suits a variety of tastes, which makes it a great place for any occasion!\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is the noise level. The restaurant gets energetic in the evening, and it seems to echo around a fair amount. This is completely fine if you're with a group of people anyways, but not necessarily ideal if you're looking to converse with an individual or two.\n\nOverall a great establishment with a fine ambiance, above standard food, and good service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v5nZgLkiE2OHbRnYkvrbDQ"}
