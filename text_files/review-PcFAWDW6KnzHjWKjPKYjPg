The museum is 3 floors and tells the story of Texas from the start of time to current. The exhibits are full of rare artifacts with full descriptions. One of the great things I did notice is the artifacts come from all over. From the Texas State Archives to private collections and everywhere in between the staff has done a great job in securing some of the most rare artifacts to put on display. In addition to artifacts they have interactive exhibits which include video, audio, touch and smell. This is not a museum where you can spend a few hours at and get something out of it. To get the full experience of the museum you need to spend at least 5 to 6 hours to see everything. With that said they have a cafe which serves great food at a great price. The museum has a IMAX which plays films about Texas and Texas History. You can get a ticket package where you can get admission to the museum and IMAX tickets for a low price. This museum has something for everyone....young and old. This is one of the best museums I have been to and the only one that comes close is the Oklahoma State History Museum.", "business_id": "DZXp8m38R0s9U3Saj4Qbcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-01", "type": "review"}
