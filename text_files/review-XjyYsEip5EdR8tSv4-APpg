I love their frozen yogurt, since it actually tastes like YOGURT and not super sweetened crap that they sell at the grocery stores or at restuarants.  I had the regular flavor, which was amazing.  Their cup sizes are a little deceiving because they actually build a yogurt tower way over the top of the cup, so it's actually quite large.  But then on the other hand, the center is hallow so it just looks bigger than it really is. Interesting toppings all the time - fresh fruits, acai, etc.  And small tables for outdoor seating during the warm weather.  I would definitely recommand to a friend...although now that we're in a recession, I am watching my purse strings a bit more.", "business_id": "e3OqPQ6ayfhIXI04FXy3Ig", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-07", "type": "review"}
