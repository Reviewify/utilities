He is great with my hair, knows what I want and is really easy to talk to! The studio is close to campus and the prices are reasonable. I often don't know what I want or how to describe what I want, but Dale always understands and is very helpful. Plus he is easy to talk to, unlike many stylists who I end up having awkward small talk with.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6S8nb2l9PT_fp7AExbUw0A"}
