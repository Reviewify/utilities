I'm not a huge fan of pizza to start with and I loathe trendy food destinations. so there was never any hurry.  To start the parking is clearly too complicated.  I pulled in to find a half dozen cars in a complete clusterfuck trying to navigate the tiny lot.  Luckily there wasn't a line at the counter. I found the place as well as the staff cold and unwelcoming immediately,. I expect that the counter people deal with a ton of douche bags ,so that's understandable.    The price for pie is insane. I know its an experience but so is a rub and tug. I'll bet I'd be more satisfied for less.    Also, pizza without soda pop is a crime. Water, fizzy water or oranjina? LAME! I also think communal seating sucks.  Asses at food level I just cannot abide.  Our pie came out so quick that i barely had time to complain. No wonder, ITS TOTALLY UNDERCOOKED. The inedible ring of char aside. The sauce is too thin, the cheese was barely melted. And where either meets the 'crust' its so doughy that it sticks to the roof of your mouth. BLECK.  I managed to choke down two slices and called it quits.  People this is not a thin crust pizza.   I had hopes of saving the experience ridding on the cannolli. Unfortunately we didn't get them on the way in and on the way out there was a line out the door. Atlanta LOVES waiting in line for overpriced food.  So we skipped it.    I can get an entire meal with my choice of beverage at Camelli's and not leave hungry.  I found the entire experience VASTLY UNDERWHELMING.", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-29", "type": "review"}
