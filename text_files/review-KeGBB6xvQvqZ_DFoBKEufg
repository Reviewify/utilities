We split the pastrami and the cajun turkey sandwich. They were both amazing and full of flavor. It's super close to where I work so I plan on coming back again. The register staff was helpful and polite with a great sense of humor. Prices range but look to spend from $8-$12 (to include drink and chips). We waited for about 5 minutes before our food was ready so it was relatively quick. Overall a great exprience but I can only imagine how busy this place will be once school is in session.", "business_id": "A-toRZgCFfvHNGkKs6-5Jw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-16", "type": "review"}
