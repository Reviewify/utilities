On a cursory glance, it seems to have decent inside seating area but patio seating is much nicer. My visit was for a late dinner so the place was pretty thinned out by then. Generally, I don't pay much attention to music in restaurants as food and drinks take precedence over everything... present company included. However, rocking Top of the Pop Chartbusters doesn't cut it in a dimly lit, Italian restaurant either. If thats something that bothers you, skip rest of the review and look for another place. Wine selection was a little disappointing. The first bottle had to be sent back... it tasted refermented. Super Tuscan bottle of wine should not be tasting like Champagne! We started with an order of Salumi Affetati - a LARGE platter of cured meats. Salami and speck were especially delicious. Entrees were tagliatelle with shitake mushroom and garganelli with sausage. Sauce was good on both orders but overall they were nothing extraordinary. Same thoughts for the dessert which was a large slice of Tiramisu. I am not an Italian food snob but I have developed my taste buds eating in some of the oldest Italian restaurants of Chicago so I am a bit spoiled. Baraonda fares better than your regular chain restaurants like Maggianos or similar, but it fell short in meeting expectations. I don't regret the first visit but it's not worth a second round.", "business_id": "ttZRucfe1fcN_DX2ZGZ1Vg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-12", "type": "review"}
