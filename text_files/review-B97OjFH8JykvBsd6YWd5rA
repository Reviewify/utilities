This review is for the Starbucks inside the Marriott Hotel at Kendall Square in Cambridge. I experienced a completely frustrating SNAFU when I tried to order a traveller and miscellaneous other items from this Starbucks ahead of time by phone for a work event. When I arrived to pick up my purchase, there was massive confusion. Once they realized that the person who took my order mysteriously disappeared without mentioning it to anyone else, the four staffers present at this location totally rallied to get the order ready and didn't make me pay for it. As an added bonus, the utter darling-sweetheart who always remembers me prepared the signature beverage that I usually order for me to enjoy while I waited. Apart from this singular occurence, the staff is normally friendly and pretty efficient. I have a higher percentage chance of receiving my order to spec here than at the other nearby Starbucks (Broadway and Ames). Keep up the good work, Kendall Marriott Starbucks staffers!!", "business_id": "_-NeBiPBmm8nf-Eq7_o0_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-23", "type": "review"}
