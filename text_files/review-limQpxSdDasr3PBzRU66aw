Also, the food here is pretty expensive, considering it's located near one of the biggest public universities in the nation. In case the owners aren't aware, college students are broke, so $13-15 for a plate is pretty steep! The only nice thing is they have a cute patio area, which has benches and lights. I enjoy sitting there on cool summer nights, which is pretty much every night...since La Jolla has the most amazing ocean weather!", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-11", "type": "review"}
