However, I don't like waiting 45mins - 1 hr to get seated. Yes, it is my fault for coming on a busy Saturday night so I don't blame them for the long wait. After I was seated, I headed to the bathroom and I passed a few empty tables. I suspect they're creating an artificial wait sort of like at popular club or lounge. Anyways, I've been craving some fried chicken lately so I ordered the \"Midnight Train\". It's 4 pieces of fried chicken wings with a side of strawberry flavored waffles. After waiting an hour, I was already pretty hungry. As my food arrived, I dove into it pretty quickly only to discover that the chicken was a little bland. For a hungry man, that's not a good sign. I'll admit the waffles were delicious but I've never met a waffle I didn't like so it isn't saying much. The chicken, on the other hand was ok at best. They're meaty but a bit on the bland side. I had to drown it in hot sauce. All in all, it was a good experience but I'm not sure if I'd wait the 45mins again though.", "business_id": "zNqQSYafieEgxB2nZ8yAFQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-19", "type": "review"}
