Cozy little place w/ soothing colors & comfy chairs at bar. \nWent for happy hour: A decent syrah w/ an array of amazing cheeses (including 1 of my fav's - Humboldt Bay) was a great way to ease into the evening.  \nSweet, little place for a date w/ my wife.  \nParked around the corner in open lot for $2 (after 4 pm) instead of flat rate in parking structure for $5.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ"}
