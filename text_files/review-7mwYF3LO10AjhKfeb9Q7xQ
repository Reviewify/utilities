Cozy little place w/ soothing colors & comfy chairs at bar.  Went for happy hour: A decent syrah w/ an array of amazing cheeses (including 1 of my fav's - Humboldt Bay) was a great way to ease into the evening.   Sweet, little place for a date w/ my wife.   Parked around the corner in open lot for $2 (after 4 pm) instead of flat rate in parking structure for $5.", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-10", "type": "review"}
