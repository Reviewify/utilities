Staff was cordial, but a little on the slower side. -Calamari (4/5): This was good, but there was something off about it. It was too soft for its own good. The sauce makes up for it though. -Short ribs entree (4/5): The actual short ribs were really good and tender. Not too big on the polenta though, and the cheese mixed into the spinach was too strong for my liking. -Atlantic salmon (3.5/5): This dish was kind of bland. Some more seasoning on the fish would've been nice. Chocolate soup (4.5/5): The souffle was delish! The syrup is infused with some sort of tangy fruit flavor.
