Staff was cordial, but a little on the slower side. \n-Calamari (4/5): This was good, but there was something off about it. It was too soft for its own good. The sauce makes up for it though. \n-Short ribs entree (4/5): The actual short ribs were really good and tender. Not too big on the polenta though, and the cheese mixed into the spinach was too strong for my liking. \n-Atlantic salmon (3.5/5): This dish was kind of bland. Some more seasoning on the fish would've been nice. \nChocolate soup (4.5/5):  The souffle was delish! The syrup is infused with some sort of tangy fruit flavor. They will write Happy Birthday on the plate and include a candle if it's your birthday. \n\nCareful with the water. I accidentally swallowed a lemon slice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MJMTsZ0ty0RCyUjF_6XVPg"}
