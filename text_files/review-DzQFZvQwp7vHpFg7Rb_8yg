There were little things that prevented me from giving a higher mark.  One thing I noticed right off the bat were the paper napkins.  For a higher end cafe which they are passing themselves off as, I would expect cloth napkins.  I get that they're trying to save money, but providing only one paper napkin per seat with no dispenser readily available is a functionality issue.   I'm more of a messy eater and I need more than one napkin. The couple times I've been here for lunch, the service was very good and attentive.  My server was prompt, polite, and gave helpful suggestions when I had trouble deciding which entree to pick.  The wait for the food to arrive wasn't overly long. On my most recent visit, I had the lamb burger.  The meat was a little dry, but I appreciated that the tzatziki sauce and pickled cucumber juices balanced this out nicely.  The clove mixed into the meat with the red onion and spinach leaf toppings rounded out the flavors.  A good burger for sure, but I expect a bit more complexity when it's gourmet.  For the side dish I chose the jalapeno jicama slaw, and was relieved to find that it wasn't too watery.  I liked the initial bite of the jalapeno with the slaw,  but wished they provided more of them.   The more spicy kick, the better. The organic food quality coupled with the clean decor, and ambiance definitely assures my return visit.", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-09", "type": "review"}
