I crave it like there is no tomorrow and even if I have it the night/day or week before I want it again and again! My favorite is the cheese and pepperoni ofcourse. The pizza is soft, cheese is fresh and it's always right out of the oven. I've gotta say this place is one of the best, you have got to check it out. They also have one in SF, too bad it closes so early ahhhh.", "business_id": "WqAtgHTxgS-B8J6iHc4eeA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-05", "type": "review"}
