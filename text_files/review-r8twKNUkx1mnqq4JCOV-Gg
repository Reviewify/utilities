It is difficult to maneuver to the bar to order snacks + alcohol because of the crowd around the bartenders. \n\nWhen you get to the bar, you are sometimes served by incompetent bartenders. I once asked for a drink and the bartender asked me what was in it and how to make it. The same bartender also made drinks for everyone in highball glasses, so my friend got a White Russian in a highball glass (which is just really weird to me...). \n\nThe size of the highball glasses are also pretty small. They are around the size of the drinks you get at expensive hotel bars, so I'm guessing you get around 6-8oz of liquid per glass. \n\nThe drinks they make for you are not very strong, so that is probably why they are so cheap. This is the place you want to go for quantity over quality.\n\nThis place does have a pool table and a dance floor, but I am not sure if that makes up for how gross the floors are in there (sticky mess of a combo of spilled stuff). \n\nThere are also quite a few creepers here. By creeper I mean ~30 year old men that hit on the ladies. So if you are a woman, I would recommend coming with a friend (or not coming at all, there are better bars out there). :)\n\nThe one thing Kip's has going for it is... It is one of the few places that still sell snacks late at night!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0JeXmrEdTrPaOsoj2axTQg"}
