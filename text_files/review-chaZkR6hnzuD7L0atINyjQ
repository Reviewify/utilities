My husband and I had pizza, I did a wine tasting and he had  some beers (Pomona Queen). The pizza was quite good, with a pesto topping and your choice of other toppings. We had the Italian pizza with proscutto. Very nice. It also comes with a small salad on the side. The wine tasting was great. I bought a bottle of Noble House Reisling that was quite delicious and under $15.00 a bottle.\n\nI also enjoyed looking at the wines in their little shop that is attached to the restaurant. They have a display of wines from wineries owned by Pomona Colleges alumni. I couldn't help but notice that their graduation dates (which were displayed) were in the 1960's and 1970's - meaning (to me) that they must have made their money doing something else and then bought a winery!\n\nMy only complaint is that we were there on a Friday evening and the place was quite busy. We waited a VERY long time for the pizza we ordered. They only have one toaster oven (looked like the one that we have from Costco), and although it did a fine job, it really is inadequate for multiple orders coming in for pizza. We did order another pizza, but something happened (bad communication, I guess) and the order never got put in - no second pizza.\n\nEven though I like to take a long time eating and enjoying a restaurant, my husband does not. Two hours there was more than enough for him. So, I would say - good food, good wine and great selections, but slow and inattentive service. Go on a weeknight when its not quite so busy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XFvBdUd311tm6dg9WRJFDA"}
