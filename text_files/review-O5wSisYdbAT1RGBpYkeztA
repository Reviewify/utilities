The menu clearly touts the fact that they use soyrizo, but whenever I try to order a soyrizo taco, the server always corrects me and says \"oh, you mean the chorizo?\"  \n\n\"Um, no, I mean the soyrizo.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, all of our chorizo is made with soy.\"\n\ngrrrrr.\n\nSo why not let me call it soyrizo like it says on the menu?  We non-pig eaters are a suspicious lot, so once you start sow-ing the seeds of distrust, it makes it hard to enjoy a taco that we suspect might have ground up snout in it or whatever it is they put in non-soy based chorizo.  And then I start to think, well, does \"soy-based\" mean that it's mainly soy with a bit of piggy parts thrown in for sabor?\n\nBah, nevermind.  I'll stick to the cheese quesadillas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wW9eE3x2TsndTKqRdAMhLA"}
