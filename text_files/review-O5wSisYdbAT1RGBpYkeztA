While we're talking about the vegetarian options, there's some mixed signals going on. The menu clearly touts the fact that they use soyrizo, but whenever I try to order a soyrizo taco, the server always corrects me and says \"oh, you mean the chorizo?\" \"Um, no, I mean the soyrizo.\" \"Oh, well, all of our chorizo is made with soy.\" grrrrr. So why not let me call it soyrizo like it says on the menu? We non-pig eaters are a suspicious lot, so once you start sow-ing the seeds of distrust, it makes it hard to enjoy a taco that we suspect might have ground up snout in it or whatever it is they put in non-soy based chorizo. And then I start to think, well, does \"soy-based\" mean that it's mainly soy with a bit of piggy parts thrown in for sabor? Bah, nevermind. I'll stick to the cheese quesadillas.", "business_id": "wW9eE3x2TsndTKqRdAMhLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-24", "type": "review"}
