The venue is small and quaint and their hours 6-10 are setup for the foodies. It reminded me a little of Ten Tables in Cambridge.  We started with the scallop and hamachi appetizers and we ordered the Duck for two.  Pre-order the duck when you make your reservations otherwise you will be out of luck! The duck  was excellent and is enough for 4 people!  They have an extensive wine list. We chose a nice 2008 Ogier La Rosine Syrah which went superbly with the duck! This is a must  and is  located across the street from Craggie on Main!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VLIkcraglJc9XoumlTOQQg"}
