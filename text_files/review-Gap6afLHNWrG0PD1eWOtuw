I enjoy the area. Easy to spot. Atmosphere: Seemed like a nice spot to check out, went inside and it was a bit claustrophobic. But nice local place to kick it, maybe outside.  Service: It was nice. Offered freshly made cookies to me, so i had to buy one.  Food: They serve things besides coffee, however i was not able to try any. When i do i will report back.  Sanitation: Good i suppose. Nothing to report.  Overall: I had coffee, and thats about it.", "business_id": "JLyP3zNKUb1VFD0MVj0ZxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-31", "type": "review"}
