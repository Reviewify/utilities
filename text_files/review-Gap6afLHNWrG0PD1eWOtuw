That's all. \n\nLocation: Claremont district. I enjoy the area. Easy to spot.\n\nAtmosphere: Seemed like a nice spot to check out, went inside and it was a bit claustrophobic. But nice local place to kick it, maybe outside. \n\nService: It was nice. Offered freshly made cookies to me, so i had to buy one. \n\nFood: They serve things besides coffee, however i was not able to try any. When i do i will report back. \n\nSanitation: Good i suppose. Nothing to report. \n\nOverall: I had coffee, and thats about it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JLyP3zNKUb1VFD0MVj0ZxQ"}
