I cannot rave enough about this place. Whenever we have friends that are visiting Seattle, we always recommend this place. Please be aware that this place is cash only. Luckily, there is a nearby ATM for all your plastic-swipers. When you walk in, this place is super tiny with only a few tables and some seats at a bar-type thingy overlooking the cook. The cook is this older, very scrawny, Thai man that works about 10 woks at once and moves really fast. It's quite a show watching him spit out all the meals of the dining area plus the many take-out orders they serve up for nearby college kids. Onto the food - breathtaking. Chris had the swimming rama and I had the spicy flat noodles. Good lord, can that crazy Thai man cook! I like that they also make it as spicy as you want as well. If you like Thai food and you're in Seattle, do this place and make sure you have cash! P.S. The prices are dirt-cheap as well! I may book a flight to Seattle now just thinking about Thai Tom!", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-29", "type": "review"}
