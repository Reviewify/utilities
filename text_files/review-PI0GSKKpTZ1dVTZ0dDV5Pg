The ambiance is very cozy and casual, although it's also dressy at night, either way you're good. Besides having their sublime cupcakes, the entire menu is awesome. We come here every other weekend and I can't rave enough about it. The crepes, salads, eggs are all good! I definitely recommend coming here for brunch and getting a table outside when it's all nice and sunny out! Oh, make sure to take cupcakes to go! They make the perfect visiting gift!", "business_id": "BbkF6j51IbcX-ed1f-bnhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-07", "type": "review"}
