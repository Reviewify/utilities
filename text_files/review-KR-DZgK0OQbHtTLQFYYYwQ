It is the best Asian bakery in town, because it is the only Asian bakery in town.  The praises that other yelpers have given reflect the win-by-default assessment. Yes, Asian bakeries are good. Yes, it is mildly surprising that Ann Arbor would have one. But if we even moderately expand our comparison class beyond our modestly little town, then Eastern Accents no longer seem so winsome. The prices are far too expensive. $2 for a bun? That is a 100% mark up compare to the typical prices (in Chicago's Chinatown, for example). $3 for an inauthentic \"Thai\" iced tea? $10 for Bibimbap? $2.50 for a slice of banana bread? While by no means outrageous, these prices are not cheap either, especially for a homely self-serving joint. The food and drinks themselves are nothing special. While I like the flakiness of the curry beef turnover, the filling has a very generic flavor to it. The moon cakes are pale imitations of the authentic version. In general, things are rather bland. The atmosphere is nice since the large windows let in a lot of light. It is also a bit a way from the campus area for a change in clientele. So I am inclined to be more lenient when thinking of Eastern Accents as a coffeeshop as opposed to a food establishment. Overall, Eastern Accents is acceptable, moderate, serviceable, but nothing exceptional.", "business_id": "AztY39QdGAkoKrLy9Di2yw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-22", "type": "review"}
