I said, 'diet soda and a water'. He replied, 'you know there is water in the soda, right? so you just want them in separate cups?' I knew we were in trouble then. \nI ask, 'what are the specials here?'. He replies, 'well, we've been around for 9 years and all the bad stuff has been removed. the food is better than the service'. I certainly hope not..... 'cause he is on fire! \nOver long deliberation we both ordered from the Brazilian side of the menu. I had the Bobo de Camero, which was beautiful large shrimp sauteed with potatoes and veggies and swimming in an oddly light tasting coconut cream sauce. Yum. The little round of bread served on the side was amazing. Doughy heaven. My friend was also happy with his meal, the Bife a Milanesa, which looked like chicken fried steak but much thinner and with less breading. \nWaiter comes back to check on how we like the food, to which he says, 'who's entree is the best? are you guys going to fight about it? maybe i should take the knives away.' Silly, yes. But it made me smile. \nI'll go back for the food, and the chance to possibly partake in another stand up routine. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "4_Z2QGkLj5QICAaSv94gnQ"}
