'cause he is on fire! over long deliberation we both ordered from the brazilian side of the menu. i had the bobo de camero, which was beautiful large shrimp sauteed with potatoes and veggies and swimming in an oddly light tasting coconut cream sauce. yum. the little round of bread served on the side was amazing. doughy heaven. my friend was also happy with his meal, the bife a milanesa, which looked like chicken fried steak but much thinner and with less breading. waiter comes back to check on how we like the food, to which he says, 'who's entree is the best? are you guys going to fight about it? maybe i should take the knives away.' silly, yes. but it made me smile. i'll go back for the food, and the chance to possibly partake in another stand up routine. :-)", "business_id": "4_Z2QGkLj5QICAaSv94gnQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-11", "type": "review"}
