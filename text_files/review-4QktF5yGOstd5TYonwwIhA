A dirt one. The Dish is perfectly paved, so I don't really think it crosses into \"hike\" territory at all. The views of the foothills, campus, and South Bay are pretty to be sure, but you're kind of in a barren grassy landscape that itself isn't too picturesque.\n\nFrom reading reviews, I was expecting to be a little bit more challenging? I went the \"harder\" way, and it was still pretty tame. To be fair, I don't know if I could run it, though.\n\nParking is pretty awful, weekend or weekday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UZ0adu-4hd27k-_URRdMbw"}
