It is a grad student's dream, excellent healthy food and cheap!  The salads are so huge I can eat them for two meals.  The bread you get with the salad is also amazing!  The service is quick and extremely efficient.  It can sometimes be hard to find a place to sit, but People's Park is just around the corner and Sproul is close too.\n\nBeware however, they only take cash!", "type": "review", "business_id": "j0C1t08TLW_iPPdC-8P_vQ"}
