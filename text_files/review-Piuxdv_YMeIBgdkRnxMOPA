Having eaten at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, arguably the top Thai restaurant in Vegas. Anyways, the appetizer of Chicken Satay was flavored perfectly, and not too salty (although the portion size was very small) and the lamb was great and cooked perfectly medium rare. It was spicy but tasty. Great place, great service, I will definitely go back. The mango sticky rice for dessert was to tie for as well. Have them add some Coconut Ice Cream on the side :-D Yummy Yummy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ofJkkF9CpfBtZdnopzxJBg"}
