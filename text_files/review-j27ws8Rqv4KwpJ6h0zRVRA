The food is inventive and interesting. The place is hopping. The staff is super helpful if maybe a tad too busy. Reservations seem like a must, even if your SO's family who you're visiting knows at least one of the higher ups here. Otherwise you might have to go upstairs and drink mimosas until a table opens up. Delicious delicious mimosas. They have salads at brunch time too. One man's brunch time is another man's lunch time. Oh, and parking is a bit of a pain.", "business_id": "YDD0n84xkd_nHmkmPorG5Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-22", "type": "review"}
