I went with a group of about 6 friends on a Friday night, and there was a line out the door. The place is BYOB so we kept ourselves entertained while we waited outside :-) It's a unique place that feels like a slice of Italy, and the table seating creates a casual and relaxed experience as you dine with all sorts of folks including Georgia Tech students and faculty, dates, parties, families and everyone in between. Did I mention it's BYOB? Yeah...I love this restaurant.", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-14", "type": "review"}
