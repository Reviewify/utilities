The pizza and atmosphere is second to none.  I went with a group of about 6 friends on a Friday night, and there was a line out the door.  The place is BYOB so we kept ourselves entertained while we waited outside :-)  It's a unique place that feels like a slice of Italy, and the table seating creates a casual and relaxed experience as you dine with all sorts of folks including Georgia Tech students and faculty, dates, parties, families and everyone in between.\n\nDid I mention it's BYOB?  Yeah...I love this restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ"}
