It really has the potential to be a super cool sports bar, but it always seems to fall short. The place is huge compared to most restaurants in Westwood, with a lower bar, a smaller upper level bar, and table seating all over the place, as well as several outdoor patio booths. There are televisions everywhere, and you will always be able to find what you want to watch.\n\nHowever, the food is insanely overpriced given the quantity and quality of each item on the menu. The burgers are ok if you want to fork over $12 for one, and when I pay $10 for buffalo wings, I expect more than five of them on the plate. On top of this, the service is usually pretty bad unless you sit directly at the lower bar. The servers always seem so clueless (they do know that they're working for tips, yes?). On busy days, Barney's can also get pretty dirty, though I suppose that's typical for a neighborhood sports bar.\n\nI do love Barney's for its enormous draft beer selection, and they always have some good monthly/daily drink specials. Barney's is great if you want to watch a game and drink a few good beers, but that's where it ends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t0Jua5Oo9247QorSQ1WzPw"}
