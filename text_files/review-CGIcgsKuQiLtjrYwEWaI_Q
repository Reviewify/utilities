I was so excited! I rushed home to tell my husband that there was an Albertos in Pasadena! He says, Why am I cooking dinner then? Lets GO!  YES! So we go down to albertos and order our usuals. The lady was very nice and I they even accept card. They had the bar for the salsa so I grabbed a TON of green sauce and waited patiently for our orders. We bought a Carne Asada Burrito, Cheese Quesadilla and taquitos. We rushed home and started eating. Yes. the Quesadilla was amazing and I could feel the pounds packing on. Then I started on my burrito. Wait. something was wrong..... It wasnt that good. Wait why?!  I have no idea but it really jsut wasnt that good. Also, we love the green sauce but i love the red sauce too, and for some reason, it was really burnt. Like Roasted red peppers or something. I dont know but it wasnt good. I love albertos so ill give it another chance and really hope they dont disappoint me next time.", "business_id": "icfrDjfJwVUOyghyPS0yaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-19", "type": "review"}
