But the yogurt is so good.  The price is pretty good, too, but I can't afford the habit anymore.  The chocolate, the white chocolate, the creme brulee.  The mint chocolate in place of a breath mint.  It's a thick, perfect consistency, and so rich the smallest cup is too much -- well, usually.  I think I've finally gotten tired of the limited selection of flavors, but I'm probably lying to myself so I won't go back.  Other places offer more flavors, but the quality of Yogurt Park's servings are way more consistent.  Coming here is always worth it, when other places are hit or miss.  To make matters worse for me, Yogurt Park stays open until midnight!  It's really hard to resist walking home with a cup of this.", "business_id": "LNdmk-ZXmTE8a2xQGL3OeQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-19", "type": "review"}
