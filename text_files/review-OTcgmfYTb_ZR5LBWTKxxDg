As said in previous reviews, FSM is over-priced, but they survive despite what they charge because of their prime location for catching students with severe mid-study session cravings. Seating is rather hard to come by, and the squirrels out on the deck are way too comfortable around people--warning: they will climb right up to your face! Previously, I've gotten their chicken sandwich, which comes with salad. Satisfying meal, but by no means extraordinary. Lines get long, though they have quick service. I think my reviews are probably positively biased just because I am always super hungry, especially when I resort to on-campus locations.", "business_id": "DO1Ukiuia9hs33VTnTY_Jg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-07", "type": "review"}
