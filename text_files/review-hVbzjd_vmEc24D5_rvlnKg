NOT AT ALL - this place looked and smelled disgusting.  the place reeked of mold and there first floor room looked directly onto the parking lot, so they had to keep the drapes/windows closed for safety and privacy.  no closet in the room either, and apparently the complimentary breakfast was pathetic.   i wouldn't pay to have my dog stay overnight there...   needless to say, they switched to Hotel Deco on 45th and Brooklyn as soon as there was an opening.  where they got a huge, clean, 11th floor corner room with views of downtown/lake union/mount rainier... all for a cheaper price. this place should get new owners who would take pride in the establishment.  if it's convenience to the U Village that you're looking for, I would recommend the equally nearby Silver Cloud Inn instead.", "business_id": "byAJceNT1x4RiX1OxNTcWw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-28", "type": "review"}
