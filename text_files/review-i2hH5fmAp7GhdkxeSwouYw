Not only is the food excellent, but the company standards are superior! The salad bar is small, but extremely detailed with the finest of salad varieties that you cannot find in any other salad bar, whether it be at a store or a restaurant! This company treats their customers like family! They also treat their employees with the utmost respect, dignity and a flexibility you could never imagine. I am writing this review to tell you my experience as a customer and proud employee of this company! Please tell your friends and family to come in and experience New Frontiers Market, where your family is our family!", "business_id": "yxNfdN-N20dRI-13hA9tbw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-09", "type": "review"}
