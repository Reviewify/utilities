The den is a bit dark for my taste but it's got a great atmosphere and the food is excellent. I had the turkey and Havarti sandwich. It reminded me of a sandwich I really like at Disney's California Adventure only I think Grendel's may actually be better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
