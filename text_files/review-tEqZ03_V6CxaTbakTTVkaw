And it's for a place I absolutely adore. I'm glad that this little town has a place for foreign and indie films, not to mention it's also the first solar-powered movie theatre in the USofA. With movie ticket prices soaring up the double digits, it's endearing to know that this theatre has awesome bargains. I seriously grab a bunch of those WOW Coupon Books for 2-for-1 tickets Wed and Thurs nights. Matinee prices are great and they even have frequent movie watcher passes. Yay! I admit it's no AMC or Century Theaters movie theater, with quality seats and big screens, but it does the job. I love the movies they show here, ya know Sony Pictures Classics, Warner's Independent, Focus Features.. etc. OH! and the wall of movie characters! They've even got Keanu Reeves. HAHA... I especially enjoy viewing the last showing of certain movies and getting dibs on their $10 movie posters. Cheap and huge! Sometimes they give out free movie posters (like that one time I grabbed 45 mad hot ballroom posters and gave them out like candy.) I usually eat downtown before coming, so I overlook the concession stand. But I remember their popcorn being a buck or something. Overall, I'm glad to have this place be my first first reviewed. I'm always down to go to the Palm whenever I'm in town. Whoopah!", "business_id": "X9Hna0jBuwkFi-PoTl1w6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-10-22", "type": "review"}
