And it's for a place I absolutely adore.  I'm glad that this little town has a place for foreign and indie films, not to mention it's also the first solar-powered movie theatre in the USofA.\n\nWith movie ticket prices soaring up the double digits, it's endearing to know that this theatre has awesome bargains.  I seriously grab a bunch of those WOW Coupon Books for 2-for-1 tickets Wed and Thurs nights.  Matinee prices are great and they even have frequent movie watcher passes.  Yay!\n\nI admit it's no AMC or Century Theaters movie theater, with quality seats and big screens, but it does the job.  I love the movies they show here, ya know Sony Pictures Classics, Warner's Independent, Focus Features.. etc.  OH! and the wall of movie characters!  They've even got Keanu Reeves. HAHA...  I especially enjoy viewing the last showing of certain movies and getting dibs on their $10 movie posters.  Cheap and huge!  Sometimes they give out free movie posters (like that one time I grabbed 45 mad hot ballroom posters and gave them out like candy.)\n\nI usually eat downtown before coming, so I overlook the concession stand.  But I remember their popcorn being a buck or something.\n\nOverall, I'm glad to have this place be my first first reviewed.  I'm always down to go to the Palm whenever I'm in town.  Whoopah!", "type": "review", "business_id": "X9Hna0jBuwkFi-PoTl1w6A"}
