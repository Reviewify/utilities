I was shocked to look in the case and see an emaciated selection of pastries. I think I saw pineapple bun, curry bun, and some cookies. That does not a Chinese bakery make! My friend ended up getting me a pineapple bun to-go, and it wasn't that good. It was pretty plain. I've had better. The food is pretty good though, i have to say. The prices are cheap-$6.50 for a plate of rice, crispy pork chops, veggies, and soup. Not bad right? I could eat that every week, but I'd probably get atherosclerosis!  I also liked the bubble tea. The red bean smoothie is very good, and the black milk tea with pudding is my favorite go-to. I ask for \"half-sugar\" because  it gets too sweet w/the pudding.", "business_id": "XyeRCD7AAkwzPL8stT_Law", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-03", "type": "review"}
