I concur with all the other reviews: bring cash, bring chairs for sure. They only allow the low chairs (6 inches off the ground) but bring them because you'll get uncomfortable on the ground. If you bring a blanket, bring a cushy one so you have padding under your bottom! There's a super long wait for the good food trucks--come early to get your food. We waited an hour for one food truck. If you get there early it helps get a good spot for your chairs or blankets. If you get reserve seating it costs a bit more but ensures you're closer to the screen. It was definitely a fun group event. :)", "business_id": "BPT-D30wcq-_SOU8pY6zTw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-09", "type": "review"}
