Don't order any of the food specials because it's not worth it. I had their vegan chili and it's actually really good (needs some extra salt though).  Atmosphere is cozy and typical of Harvard Square. Okay place to hang out with friends but the food, in general, isn't really worth it. I prefer Tommy Doyle's, which is right across the street.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}
