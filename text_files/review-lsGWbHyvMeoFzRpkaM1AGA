I am not an Indian food expert by any means, so I can't speak to the authenticity at all, but I've always enjoyed the food I've gotten from India Samraat. We tend to get the same thing every time: Chicken Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala, an extra container of Basmati Rice, Cheese Pakora, and Naan. And sometimes, as a treat, we get Mango Lassies. We've also occasionally ordered the Veggie Samosas and/or Veggie Pakora. This is usually enough for at least two meals for the two of us, and it tastes just as good reheated later in the week. We've become such regulars that they've actually started giving us a little discount every now and then. One of these days we'll actually have to go in and check out the restaurant we've been ordering all this food from for so long.", "business_id": "mhZL8QyPjuqUWePU1oPuEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-31", "type": "review"}
