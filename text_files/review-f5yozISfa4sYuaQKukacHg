I even talked Dr. Murphy about Yelp during my eye exam. Anyway, she did a good job. The eye exam was enjoyable and thorough. Plus, she introduced me to a different contact lens product that had never been mentioned to me in my many years wearing them and going to other eye doctors. They were pleasant and responsive. So check them out, when you need a eyeball check up!", "business_id": "0fC_ZBjBmdo53Cdz5PLyfg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-24", "type": "review"}
