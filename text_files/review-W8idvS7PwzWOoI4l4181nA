I told the manager about it and he took 1 meal off the bill and gave a discount on the other. Waiter was nice but overall this is my last trip to this restaurant chain. If you want superb Mexican food go to Chevy's in Burbank.", "business_id": "3ig_tq9MqJyMiOUI-6kuTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-09-21", "type": "review"}
