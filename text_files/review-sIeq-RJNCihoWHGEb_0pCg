My friend and I ordered an appetizer and two entrees. As someone who often travels to Thailand, the Thai food here is worst than subpar. It is just too greasy.  After dinner, we both didn't feel too well, especially since we had to get ready to go out. I would say, I'd only go to this restaurant once in a while and not make it a habit because the food is not good for anyones health.", "business_id": "KzgI3kFHxYdf-l3e0U-mdw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-08-14", "type": "review"}
