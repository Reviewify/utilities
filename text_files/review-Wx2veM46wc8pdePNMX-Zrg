Their in-store stock is somewhat limited and they really dont have much in the way of software. One cool thing is that the educational discount is already applied to all items, and you just have to affirm that you are entitled to receive it. They have nice people working here who definitely want to help you, but they may or may not possess all the Mac smarts that they profess to you. Case in point: I went in for a Mac Mini and it was determined that the best course of action would be to order it online and have it shipped (went off w/o a hitch, 6 days later). The guy at the IL Apple Center said I would need a certain adapter for the Mac Mini to attach to my monitor (which had a DVI input). Fact of the matter is the Mac Mini comes with just such a cable in the box. I spent $18 when I did not need to (and unfortunately I opened the package and lost the receipt).", "business_id": "R0SY86PqTcp80TFvGrLi9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-22", "type": "review"}
