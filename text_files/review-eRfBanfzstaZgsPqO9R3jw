I asked about the parts first, pulling out some components from my backpack and asking if they had various sub-assemblies, bolts, nuts, etc. The employee I was talking to said they had none of these parts. Fair enough, these are relatively uncommon components. Rather than refer me to a mechanic, though, or someone who might have more knowledge, they were dismissive and disinterested in helping me further. The store also didn't have the cone wrench I was looking for. Basically: - poorly stocked with tools - narrow knowledge base about bicycles - not particularly helpful (\"we don't have that, but you might try X or Y\" would have been a better response).  The shop seems to be designed more to cater to a crowd that values appearances more than function or practicality. As a bicycle commuter, my interests are aligned completely differently: function follows form when getting around here.", "business_id": "07VwweSmOMqPuFbi9MO4fw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-26", "type": "review"}
