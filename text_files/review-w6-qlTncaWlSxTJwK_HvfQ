We had some sushi a la cart and then the sushi deluxe dinner.  While the initial sushi a la cart were quite fine and the fish was actually fresh, the sushi deluxe dinner was disappointing. The tuna were a bit fishy and the white fish did not taste that fresh.   The one thing that made it worse was that they could not get the basics right - the sushi rice was too chewy and did not have the right amount of vinegar taste.  The rice affects overall sushi taste a lot!", "business_id": "PEv6gtuj01IMkVS_1hiCuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-05", "type": "review"}
