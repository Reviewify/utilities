Slainte is located literally right next to the 30th Market/Frankford entrance/exit and across the street from the 30th St Amtrak station. It's also right down the street from Drexel. So it seems to be at the nexus for commuters and students. As such the crown inside was fairly diverse, ranging from students, professors, business guys, to the construction guys sitting next to me. I ended up sitting at the bar, since the host did not deem to acknowedge me after standing around for at least 5 minutes. The bald headed bartender/Mr. Clean took my order for beer promptly and gave me a menu. The Sam Adams Oktoberfest was nice and crisp and tasty. The Guinness he poured for me was perfect, not too much head, just enough. Since I came after 7 I thought I'd get charged full price, but he gave me the happy hour price for both beers. Sweeet. The California wrap I had was ok, but nothing special.  The fries were decent and plentiful. Service from the bartender was excellent. He was attentive without being intrusive and was very fast at pours. He also knew his crowd and talked to some of the regulars.  I could see coming back here for a happy hour and to get some of their $5 appetizers. I\"m not sure I'd come back for the food though.", "business_id": "c8rjE6NcfeyzLB_aU1GdMA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-06", "type": "review"}
