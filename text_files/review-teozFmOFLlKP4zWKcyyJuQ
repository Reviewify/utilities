Prepare yourself for macrobrews and typical fryer-centric bar food; annoying snobs like myself make do with (unfortunately) breaded buffalo wings and a pint of Guinness.  Since its served up by an old Irish woman who looks like she doesn't take sh*t from anyone, much less some no account punk kids wandering in off the street, I give it a pass.  \n\nBonner's doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't and doesn't have to.", "type": "review", "business_id": "52iW9Eo-EWJZXYYjQ5pAKw"}
