Came here for Mother's Day brunch. This review is based on my Mother's Day experience. The Good: 1. The venue is homey; a fireplace is situated in the middle of the back room. (It was unusually cold today, and we're already in May!) 2. The first two orders of mimosa is only $1.00 each with any egg meal. The drink is refreshingly tasty. 3. The corn bread is moist, warm and flavorful. 4. The restaurant is directly across from my loft, so it's ridiculously convenient. You can't beat that! The Bad: 1. They should have anticipated that Mother's Day is a busy occasion, but they were severely understaffed.  As a result, service was dead slow.  (Thankfully, the server was polite, apologetic and tried his best to please.) 2. Food is pricey. I don't mind paying for good food, but the spinach omelet and roast beef were bland. I don't think this place carries Tabasco or Tapatio.  I wanted so badly to add kick to my omelet.   3. The corn bread is free with brunch, but you have to request for it. The waitstaff will not readily offer the free bread to you.  Overall, this place is not bad - but definitely not 5-star material.", "business_id": "Rq4uo4COsP8W-oo1KgTavQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-09", "type": "review"}
