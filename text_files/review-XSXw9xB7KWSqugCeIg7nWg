And after a long work day and workout all I wanted to do was get home, eat, and watch the NBA Finals.  In the shopping plaza a mile away from my hotel is a little hole in the wall called Yummy Maki Yummy Box.  Yeah, the name is a little funny but the sushi is awesome.  I got an order of Rainbow and California rolls to go and had them while I watched the game.  I wish I had taken a photo to post, but I was too hungry!  Give this place a try if you're in the area.  They'll even deliver.", "business_id": "o7BQ5ZQDWbplY1nKKl_FEg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-06", "type": "review"}
