First of all, I love to watch the music video channel and it has not been working for over two months now. What's the deal? And the tvs in general are going down the drain. Last week I went at a really off time, hoping to get to use an elliptical with a functioning tv and tried four or five machines before I found one that works. And the one I ended up using doesn't count calories correctly, unless I am superwoman because I glanced at it after ten minutes and it said I had burn 720 calories. Waaah? Not super important, but it's nice to know how many calories I've worked off.
