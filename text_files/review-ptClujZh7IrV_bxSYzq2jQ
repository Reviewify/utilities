Random thoughts about Sprinkles: Strawberry, Vanilla, Orange, Red Velvet and Irish Chocolate (St Patty's Day)....these are my favs...strawberry is probably my number one and I'm usually a major chocolate fan! So light in flavor, yet perfectly done. The vanilla is just amazing. Many of the flavors are a little overbearing such as the chocolate marshmallow and the dark chocolate...way too much frosting/cake. Yes, they are hella expensive...get over it.... My Mom (and a few others I've spoken to) complains that they don't put enough salt in the cupcakes... We bought the red velvet cupcake mix and the vanilla cupcake mix and turned them into my fiance's birthday cake.....the guests made the request that we make about 10 of them next year because the one we made lasted 5 minutes before it was devoured. Sprinkles pretty much rocks my socks.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-16", "type": "review"}
