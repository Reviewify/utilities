The setting is beautifully done - a warm, dark wood bar, inviting cocktail tables and low chairs, and floor to ceiling windows fronting the space.  An elevated dining room in the center of the space is unique.  Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired.  At $44 per head for the speared meat and side/salad bar, it's pricey.  The side bar featured cold dishes that should have been hot and cold dishes that, while supposed to be served cold, were bland and flavorless.  The meat purveyors were much more pleasant than our standoffish server.  The meat quality was just ok and frequently, the meat was overcooked and barely lukewarm.  My fave was the spicy chicken, followed by the lamb.  Overall, food quality and service will need to improve before we head back.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-19", "type": "review"}
