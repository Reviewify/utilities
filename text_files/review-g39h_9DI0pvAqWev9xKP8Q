The second time I placed an order for pick up, because I really didn't care for the atmosphere the first time.  I ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes past the time they told me my food would be ready. The quality of the food this time was TERRIBLE. I understand they were busy, but the staff either needs to figure out how to deal with being swamped or they need to hire more people. I'm not saying I'd never go here again, but I wouldn't seek it out.", "business_id": "Lqr5YF6N6nSRb7WChYNOgg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-07", "type": "review"}
