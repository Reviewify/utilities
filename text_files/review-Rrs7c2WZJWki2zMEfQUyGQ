Nothing turned up that was better than the greasy spoons I knew from 50 years ago. Then, driving down Pawling Ave., I spotted this clean-window double-storefront place with many cars in front. Gave it a try. Was EXTREMELY pleased with Carol's Place. The restaurant portion is next to the Pizza & Subs shop. Very informal, very pleasant staff. The eggs and bacon were the best I've had in two months of eating eggs out almost every day the past two months. Decor is a long counter and many tables. Yes, the staff is ultra-cordial to the many very regular customers, but they've never seen me before and I couldn't hope for any better service. They are open fro 6 or 7AM until 2PM, then 4PM until 11 or 12 for dinner. Daily specials are on a chalkboard. Bacon, eggs, toast are $5.99 . The home-baked rolls and coffee cakes look great (not on my diet :={{{ ).", "business_id": "AHzOTzpGa3pIfYDSP2VYIA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-07", "type": "review"}
