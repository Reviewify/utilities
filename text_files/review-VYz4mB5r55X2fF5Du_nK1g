I came here with a friend for the first time on Friday after reading Yelpers' reviews. You guys make me happyyyyy :)\n\nWe both ordered the iced Milk Tea with boba, plain and simple. It was sweet, but not overpoweringly sweet. The boba were more than plentiful and perfectly textured. My drink was ready about 10 seconds after ordering, which was quite nice. \n\nThe highlight of my time spent sipping my tea while it was pouring rain outside came when my companion inhaled a boba and did a combined hack-snort to keep from choking. Those damn boba. How I love them..\n\nEDIT: My new lover: large almond snow with boba. HALLELUJAH. I'm addicted, and it's a little bit sad, but I'm still happy about it because it's so damn delicious. New rating: 5 stars.\n\nEDIT x2: Whoa, whoa, WHOA. It's 90 degrees+ out, and your BLENDER is BROKEN? And you therefore can't make any heat-relieving snows or slushes?! For multile days in a ROW?!?!?!? Not cool, guys, not cool.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ch1ercqwoNLpQLxpTb90KQ"}
