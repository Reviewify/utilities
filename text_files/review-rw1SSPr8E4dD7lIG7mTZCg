Their veggie burgers are not much different from cafeteria veggie burgers. The tofu and avocado sandwich is pretty decent, but almost two dollars more. \nSometimes the food is bland, but the portions are always large. This is a neat place if you want to fill up on less than five dollars.  \n\nThe Place: \nJust a block from the UC campus and always busy. However, the food is prepared pretty quickly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q0j0-u8WHHczEg5c9DPQKg"}
