You need to know exactly what to get in order to have a fantastic time at Madam Mam's. I know, I know, the menu is large, but I am writing this update to save your money and please your palates. APPETIZERS: A5 - Spicy fish cakes; so savory and flavorful! A10 - Deep fried rice paper; the servings are on the sparse side, but still good. ENTREES: F5 - My go-to spaghetti stir-fry. I wouldn't recommend ordering it with tofu, which is kind of mealy. F11 - A flat rice noodle dish that hits the spot. NS8 - Excellent lemongrass noodle soup. P40 - Fried tilapia with an excellent tamarind sauce. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, but I also suggest sharing this with another person since it's rather large. P46 - Feeling up for some amazing pot roast? Go for it! It's tender and spicy. DESSERT: D1 - Sticky rice with mango. Most people already know this is good. D3 - Best banana dessert you will ever have, trust me. The compilation of this list was made with much help from my friend Vince, who is much more of a Madam Mam's expert than I am, but due to his laziness he refuses to create a Yelp account. I understand that their big menu is what exactly keeps Madam Mam's from getting five stars... but I'm hoping that more people will be able to have better dining experiences due to this list. I've eaten all of these and vouch for their wonderful flavors, and I will continue to maintain this list in the future as I try new things.", "business_id": "hTp23z3Q5PCvuGvKTIQtXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-25", "type": "review"}
