The employees are super friendly and it's quick. I like that it's late night so you can always go for that late night bite.  I always bump into someone i know here and my little girl loves it here. It would be more awesome if they had seating but the food makes up for it.", "business_id": "p7SZnq-msIbO5oElxyuIxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-24", "type": "review"}
