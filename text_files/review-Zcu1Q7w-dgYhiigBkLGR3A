I LOVE this place for special occasions, romantic dinners, or just plain treating myself to some delicious food. I've been here for restaurant week, to celebrate a birthday, and even as a gift to myself after a particularly difficult but rewarding work week. Such a great restaurant with wonderful staff who are very accommodating, informative, and engaging. They had wonderful recommendations and were very knowledgeable about their dishes. I will say that this is a lovely place to indulge and I did just that! Crisp pork belly with the diablo glaze (which I would totally swim in) is delicious and perfectly prepared with a crisp outer layer and melts like butter on the tongue. The asian pear and fried mint garnish provide just the right accent of sweetness to pair with the salty porcine goodness. The oil poached tenderloin is a gift from the gods paired with the smooth, buttery, and velvety pureed potatoes. The finish of frito misto was the perfect pungent contrast to the rich and indulgent textures. Oh my god. I have dreams of crisp pork belly. Thumbs so way up.", "business_id": "gghrK_T4ulGBgJPtn2cbiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-10", "type": "review"}
