Usually, the deciding factor was not if I had been drinking and couldn't drive there, only where I had been drinking.  If we were in West Campus, we were going to Pluckers.  If I was at my house on 12th and Lamar, we were ordering Pluckers. \n\nIn the last couple of months, they tore down the old University Gardens Apartment building that housed Pluckers (and use to have Gumby's too) and built a monstrosity of a garage behind it to house a leasing office and some retail/office space.  Well, Pluckers is now a tenant in the building.  Even though i miss the memories that I have from the old location, the new one is much more comfortable and a much better place to watch a game.  Plus, they have a new patio.  And, wait for it,.....................wait for it....................a FULL BAR.  Of course, this isn't as big of news as it would have been when I was 21 and bars were noticeably absent from the West Campus area, but, it's still a welcome addition (my office is close).  But the new building is like the S Lamar, Round Rock, and Lakeline locations and has a ton of plasmas playing every sport you can imagine and the chairs and tables are much nicer, new, and comfortable.  So, if you need a place to hang out before or after taking in a UT game, you should definitely give the new Plucker's a try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hGNI2d-tCmVwUWKztDDl2w"}
