No, it is not \"authentic\" mexican food, but so what? Some authentic food can be appaling. The food is great and it does not pretend to be only mexican. They serve great cajun dishes with staples like catfish and crawfish. The place is cheap and great for large groups and an after-work margarita. \nFood, fun and a festive atmosphere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A"}
