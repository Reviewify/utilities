Their \"Internet Sales Department\" is basically a trap to lure you into their showroom.  They never directly answered my questions, they only made vague and unverified claims that they had the best prices, best options, even lower fees and sales taxes!  When I asked for specifics, they would not provide anything, just more begging for me to come into their showroom.  Most creepy, they never referred to me by name, all their emails started with a generic \"hello ;\" it made me feel more like a stalked victim than a valuable customer. There are more than a dozen Honda dealerships in the DC metro area, no one should shop at this one.", "business_id": "HLLnml55hd_izrahJIiMew", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-13", "type": "review"}
