The service was great but the food was awful I ordered the snapper and it was actuallysoggy. It was probably due to the fact that the fish was frozen and the sides was really bland. My husbands food had no flavor. I just have to say that the food isn't worth the money. I will never go back. I just liked the waiter.he was really nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qfNX18O5FdknoUjfI0n-fQ"}
