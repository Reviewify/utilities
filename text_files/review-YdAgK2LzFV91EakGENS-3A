I am not a foodie, but I would describe it as \"Asian-American fusion.\" We went here for restaurant week dinner. The service was fantastic. The atmosphere was cool. The food was decidedly \"meh.\" It was totally edible, but nothing to write home about. I had the fried shrimp appetizer, the vegetarian entree, and the creme brulee. In all fairness, the creme brulee was awesome, but then I've never met a creme I didn't like.", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-19", "type": "review"}
