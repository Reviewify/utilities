I honestly feel like this is the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. My friend and I got the special menu. He got the veggie soup and I got the wonton soup. Both seriously were lukewarm and tasted like water. Our appetizers of fried tofu and spring roll was alright, but far from the best I've tasted. As for our main course, we got pad thai and green curry. The green curry was very thin and salty. Not flavorful, just salty. The pad thai tasted like ketchup.  Service was great, but the food was terrible.", "business_id": "lS42krxXMm-HIk7dntRsKQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-09", "type": "review"}
