I live in NY and I haven't seen a lot of these flavors.  Boysenberry, caramel, and cake batter are the flavors I haven't seen elsewhere.  I think I sampled all those plus others (blueberry, vanilla, original, and a few more).  My fav's were the cake batter and boysenberry. Great selection of toppings as well. All in all, great fro yo and good price! Will be back next time I'm in town.", "business_id": "6E4qfgHlGwm7eDQOtlcxaQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-11", "type": "review"}
