And expect the nicest group of southern people you've seen in a while. Thinking back on my lunch from yesterday, the people working here were what resonated with me the most. I think every employee we passed on the way in AND on the way out said hello, or thanks, or something cordial. It was nice. The food: your basic southern cooking. A meat-n-3 type of place. I had fried chicken with mac and cheese, fried okra, and green beans. Greasy goodness. The mac and cheese was my least favorite because it was cooked so long, it was a bit more like cheesy mush. Lunch was served with buttery biscuits and moist cornbread. Yum! The other thing is that they are so fast here! I think our food was on the table less than 5 minutes after ordering! This is a great place to go if you are in the Midtown neighborhood, you're looking for some good, comfort food, and don't have a lot of time for lunch.", "business_id": "Ic2xakPYKgM_Uma5hnLnFg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-03-14", "type": "review"}
