Went there to repair headphone jack and replace battery. They returned the pod and the casing wouldn't close. I thought this was a simple mistake. The guy disappears for a half hour while I wait and then comes out and says the faceplate is defective and they will replace. They don't call me to tell me it's fixed. I go in and they replaced it with a used faceplate that looks like somebody ran over it. They ere extremely rude and dismissive. So in essence I went in for engine work and came out with a smashed up car. I hate being ripped off (who doesn't). This place should be shut down.", "business_id": "_wpB4HodaB4IU7DKjW-oOQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-20", "type": "review"}
