Although it is a fairly expensive restaurant, the food here is always top-notch and I always recommend it as a location for a special occasion or romantic date.  Located off of Harvard Square, Sandrine's serves Alsatian food (German/French-influenced) and one of the only two restaurants in Boston where I have found good \"wurst.\"  Famous for their food and dessert, go to this restaurant and experience it for yourself!\n\n(Side note: if you see poached peach with ginger ice cream on the menu, ORDER IT!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "G0bkSEyElXerSXNy6P8BNQ"}
