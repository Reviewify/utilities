They recently reopened at their new location right on Walnut Street and are in the process of putting in a pizza oven as well.  My personal favorite flavor is the strawberry cheesecake gelato but unfortunately it's hardly ever on rotation.  I keep going back for more of it with limited success.  Mango, key lime and peanut butter are almost as equally delicious and those aren't even their \"bestsellers.\"  They have so many flavors to choose from that you'll have to go back to try them all!  It's a little more pricey than your typical ice cream but it's well worth the extra cost.  I always go with the small size and it's just enough to quench your craving without making you feel guilty.  You know it's good when you're trying to find excuses to stop in Shadyside so you can swing by and grab a cup of gelato when you live in the North Hills!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kwMJ4KfhEcrk9jiMe-S6wQ"}
