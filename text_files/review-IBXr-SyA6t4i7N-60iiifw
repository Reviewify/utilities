They're clearly aiming for a Euro-cafe character, but they don't push it too far. I've been coming since the week they opened and it's been great to see them develop their own personality.\n\nAs for the food and drinks, they do the basics admirably using high-quality ingredients, but go beyond that by featuring new and interesting items that you probably won't find elsewhere. For me, nothing warms up a rainy fall evening like their Almond Earl Grey tea. I take it as a sign of good taste that they seem to stay away from cloying \"candy\" drinks (the Caramel-White Chocolate-Marshmallow-Latteccinos you'll find at some other places).\n\nSide note: Kudos for always having at least a couple of vegetarian options, clearly marking which soups are veg., awesome vegan brownies, and soy milk options for drinks (standard these days, but still appreciated).\n\nOverall, Crema seems like a place run by people who truly care about great coffee, quality food, and creating a welcoming space for people to meet, hang out, study, or just sit and contemplate life over a steaming mug of one's favorite drink. If they keep it up, I expect they'll be a Harvard Square institution for a long time to come.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ"}
