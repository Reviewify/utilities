Let me repeat: DONT DO IT! AVOID AT ALL COST! The old man that works here is a total D-Bag. I called him earlier in the day asking how much they would pay per oz of gold, He quoted me 1750. When I arrived there later that afternoon, he then knocked the price down to 1650. I asked him whats up with that, and he told me that his brokers online could only offer him 1650!! Then I was a little upset and asked him why he told me 1750 earlier and now he changed his price. GUESS WHAT? HE TOTALLY FLIPPED OUT! HE GOT SUPER MAD and said if you dont want this price take your stuff and you can leave. Are you kidding me? I have every right to ask him why the sudden price change, but when you're running a business, thats no way to treat your customers. This guy serious needs to take a chill pill and check his panties for tiremarks because he's got some serious attitude problems. On the otherhand, there was a lady that worked there and she was much friendlier. But I assume the owner is this old fart, and he's running the show. Either way, dont come here because he will rip you off and then give you major attitude. Looking at the reviews below, I'm not the only one who had this experience. Take your business somewhere else. There are plenty of coin shops around and they'll actually give you a fair price. I cant believe this place is still open!", "business_id": "AkCGVy6fKPV3hWW6joLL3w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}
