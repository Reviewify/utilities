I came here to see \"Hell's Kitchen Dance\" with Mikhail Baryshnikov and was really happy to discover that our last-minute tickets in the upper side balcony still had relatively close-up views. It was kind of crappy that some of the seats up there are on a diagonal, so if you come with a cuddle buddy be prepared to ... well, not cuddle. Parking was easy in the downstairs garage, and Berkeley's campus was very pretty, if slightly haunted-feeling (no students; it's summer). Three stars to the theatre but a definite five stars to the show... if you're heading to NYC soon, check it out! \"The Russian\" can still dance a mean ballet!", "business_id": "0GieyCzEfmebTjg7dTD5tg", "stars": 3, "date": "2006-06-20", "type": "review"}
