I like this store.  It's always neat and orderly, they have lots of fun things for when I am in the mood to browse for something I don't really need, they have a good-sized grocery section for quick things you might need in a pinch, and the pharmacy is very good.  The people in the pharmacy, and generally in the entire store, are friendly and helpful, and are very patient with me when I use all my coupons that I got on my previous store receipt (I am a sucker for the ExtraBucks).  For those driving to the CVS, they have a lower-level parking garage just behind the store (enter on 6th Street) with stairs and an elevator leading up to the store.  You don't even have to go outside!  Occasionally the front of the store attracts people asking for money so, if you want to just avoid this, you can sneak into the parking deck and take the stairs up (even when I walk I sometimes do this).  Sometimes the lines get long to check out here but they generally move pretty quickly and, if not, they usually will open up another register very soon.", "business_id": "QE1IKQkSV6Y98JNwOJXX-A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-28", "type": "review"}
