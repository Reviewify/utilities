How the two differ is beyond amazing to me. What I love is that they accept the Cal 1 debit card so my dad can still pay for my late night study sessions when I have a group project. MAJOR PLUS! Besides from that, I love that it's always full of people studying and doing everything and anything. The seats outside where you can just relax on a cool nice day and eat a slice of cheesecake with a strawberry on time? Fantastic! People watching because you are taking the fiftieth study break? Yess!! The coffee could be a little bit better so stick to the espresso-based drinks, seriously. I am a big fan of their Americanos (espresso and hot water) and just snacking on their pastries. The only thing that I hate is that they are just horrid at managing their lines. I used to work at Starbucks back in the day and we expedited people through by taking their orders in line so we can have their drinks done when they pay. Why can't this place do the same if you know your store is busy, especially during certain hours? Additionally, I look at the people that grab the food and damn, they look really good but I am just too broke to pay for those salads and sandwiches. They look amazing but why must you break the bank?! :(", "business_id": "DO1Ukiuia9hs33VTnTY_Jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-12", "type": "review"}
