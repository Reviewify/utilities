It was here that I learned to love Greenflash and Allagash White and Victory Pilsner. Long live the amazing selection of this place.  Also, they do have two dollar beers, but bartenders here will raise eyebrows if you order Lindemann's Peche, let alone cocktails. This is a beer bar. For wine, visit its popular, shinier younger sibling, the Dirty Truth. You see, in addition to having an awesome beer menu, this bar has a mug club. The deal is that you and your wallet can get down to the Moan and Dove a LOT and try lots of things including some things that are warm and flat, and if you make it through the whole beer obstacle course in less than a year, you read a poem to the bar and then get a mug with your name on it, for life. And then, after that, every time you order a beer, you get even more beer for your money. It really only makes financial sense if you are a long-term resident, but damn is it awesome.", "business_id": "RXjTCrjDGRRlZa4GCMz26Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-30", "type": "review"}
