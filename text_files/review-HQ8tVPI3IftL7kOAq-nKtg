Festive hats for any occasion, and the accessories to prove that you know how to wear them.\n\nMy favorite experience is coming into the store one day and very meekly asking if they have wigs for dressing in drag for a school project. Boy, the two ladies who were working there couldn't be more eager to help! All of their wigs were very reasonably priced and looked great in that regard. They also suggested a menagerie of items from tiny hats to feather boas to complement coiffures of any type and even gave suggestions on what looked most dramatic and glamorous for a drag queen. They turned what could have been an awkward situation into the most entertaining session of \"dressing up\" I've ever had. I owe them the most awesome \"A\" I've ever received on a film project.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GjF9aSQzK1k_1nQfjCkb9w"}
