I grew up here, and I honestly don't know why I left. Carr Mill is a godsend (and that's coming from someone who couldn't care less a/b religion). The shops are locally owned and run, the kind of stuff you won't find anywhere else, the kind of stuff that makes you appreciate your neighbors. And both of the restaurants are damn good, by the way. A diner and quality Italian food, what more could you ask? There's a reason you don't get \"thank you\" when you shop there: thank you is something the chains teach their employees to say but never explain why. It's about being comfortable and knowing people: they don't have to thank you for being in Carrboro.\nCarr Mill is way more than \"just something to look at,\" and y'all would understand if you really experienced the mall the way a native does.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KeI0EKf0zqmSi5VRoUt6cw"}
