I have been here more than once, and their mochas are getting worse. Today really sealed the deal and made me decide that I will not be back for a long time for coffee of any sort. The mocha was so bland that I thought I was drinking very watered down hot chocolate. It wasn't sweet, and it had no coffee flavor. It tasted more like the paper cup it was in. I was disappointed. Like others before have mentioned, the place is dusty and dirty. There are flies. The only reason I am are giving milano two stars is because their sandwiches are decent and the location convenient. Milano, you used to be so good, like when I came for the first time. Now you just disappoint me.", "business_id": "NGyFcZHghu1uJ0G-pXJxoQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-15", "type": "review"}
