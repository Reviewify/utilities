Chocolate cake, chocolate cheesecake, chocolate cookies, chocolate ice cream, chocolate drinks, chocolate covered fruit, chocolate bars - you want it, they got it. There are two sections. The left has tables and is an eating area while the right is like a traditional chocolate store. When you walk in, the ice cream bar greets you with around 20 tempting flavors. But persevere to the left and you will see mountains of cake, cheesecake, brownies, and more. The cakes are ENORMOUS. I think they're almost a foot tall. I thought it would be a piece of cake (hah, pun?) to finish but I was defeated. Even with help from a friend. And though the cheesecake slices are smaller by volume, they are so rich that they are also almost impossible to finish alone. IMHO, the cakes are a bit dry and bland. The cheesecakes are richhhh and sweet. The ice cream is also very rich and creamy. But the hot chocolate...we were given a shot-size to try because we were warned that it was very thick. Honestly, that shot size was more than enough. It was like drinking liquid chocolate and cream that's the consistency of corn syrup. But what they can do (and is a good alternative) is they can sell you a small hot chocolate and milk and then mix it for you. That is a more reasonable (and delicious) hot chocolate to consume. So all in all, a good place for chocolate lovers but a bit too rich for me. A good excuse to go with friends and share (and then you can also try more things!).", "business_id": "IoL6l_mU7JB_uylOhwf1qw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-12", "type": "review"}
