As Forrest D. says, it's pretty much a shopping mall food court without the shopping mall, which makes for a pretty interesting dining experience.\n\nI must say that I've never had Peruvian food before, so I may not be the best judge of this place. I came here with two friends late one night about an hour before they closed. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. I attempted to order the Arroz con Pollo, but they were out, so I switched to the Aji de Gallina. The flavors and spices were definitely delicious and interesting. However, everything in the dish was about the consistency of lumpy baby food. I couldn't really get over the textures, so I'm rating Mo-Chica as just A-OK, but the flavors are really great and the provided salsas add a nice kick, so if you can get over the texture, you should check this place out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g"}
