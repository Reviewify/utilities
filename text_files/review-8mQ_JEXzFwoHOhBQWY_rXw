Maybe it just meant more tip for her...other than that I don't think I'll be coming back...not unless I'm on my period and craving chocolate...reading other reviews, I will definitely not be coming for the dinner portion...sounds like shabu but bland saltwater unlike the Japanese shabu...mmm shabu..", "type": "review", "business_id": "urg20Z_Ikho8ADXXzu00Vw"}
