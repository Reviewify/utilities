Well, I would recommend going for the smaller size - regardless of how large the group is...we couldn't finish two orders for 7 girls...it was just way too much chocolate and I'm a girl that loves the stuff...definitely felt they should had more fruits than brownies and marshmellows...just felt so ehhh...you know that feeling... Our server was pretty awesome - she split the bill 7 ways! Maybe it just meant more tip for her...other than that I don't think I'll be coming back...not unless I'm on my period and craving chocolate...reading other reviews, I will definitely not be coming for the dinner portion...sounds like shabu but bland saltwater unlike the Japanese shabu...mmm shabu..", "business_id": "urg20Z_Ikho8ADXXzu00Vw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-16", "type": "review"}
