Thank god an ice cream sandwich was only $1.50 so I didn't feel too bad throwing away the last third of my sandwich. There was a line at 11:30pm. My boyfriend and I were craving dessert after a hearty meal so we decided to finally try this new establishment. Line moved fairly quickly. We both got rocky road and chocolate chip cookies with french vanilla ice cream. The first two bites were good but after that, we both felt like we were eating spoonfuls of sugar in every bite. The cookies were fresh but so fresh they just melted and got very messy with the ice cream in the tiny bag it's in. It was seriously toooooo sweet and even for a sweet tooth, I couldn't handle it. We've both never craved water so much. Eventually we gave up on eating the cookies and decided to eat just the ice cream with spoons but even that was really sweet so we gave up everything altogether. I'm sure the ice cream itself is good and the level of sweetness is normal, but combined with the cookies, I felt like I needed to give myself an insulin shot right away.  I checked the menu of cookies and I don't see any other cookie that could be less sweet except for oatmeal raisin, so there's nothing else I could've really ordered to satisfy my taste. I've been to Diddy Riese before as well as a lot of other patrons and it's definitely a lot better quality and taste. In the end, you definitely get what you pay for. The only good thing is that it's open late so I guess it'll satisfy late night ice cream/dessert cravings, but then I'd rather just drive to safeway and buy some haagen dazs.", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-20", "type": "review"}
