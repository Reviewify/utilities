Over 40 flavors AND seasonal flavors too. Perfection in Princeton, to a T.  The best thing about Halo Pub in a college town is that it is open  LATE ... especially in the summer time. Craving ice cream at 11:30pm? No problem. Plus, they have the most lip smacking dessert shop next door. Stop in and experience this for yourself .. the ice cream or desserts .. it will not disappoint !", "business_id": "vqQ_nyjIyLzoO9c6yiw9mg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}
