You don't have towels??  BEFORE. I. GO. ANY. FURTHER. Watch this video. Watch it several times. On repeat.  Then come back to this review. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSqvy93s4ao Did you watch it?? Did you see that shit??  THAT IS THE METAPHORIC EQUIVALENT OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO WORKOUT AT A GYM THAT DOES NOT OFFER TOWEL SERVICE.  (Btw if you haven't seen \"Along Came Polly\" it is not only one of the greatest comedic masterpieces of our modern times but it is also Phillip Seymore Hoffman's Magnum Opus) I mean.. If i ever go to a low-level establishment such as \"Workout Anytime\", \"Absolut Power\", \"Steel Gym\", \"Ballys\", etc. I can expect there to ain't be no towels (as well as a musty stench thats reminiscent of a hooters waitress I once intimately knew from Goochland, Virginia)..and thats why NACHO dont work out at low-level gyms...OR have relations with no women farther than a 120 mile radius off of both the eastern and western coasts IT JUST AINT HYGIENIC TO A HYGIENIC NIGGA LIKE MYSELF. Yes.. Nacho IS a bougie-ass nigga. This is true.  But a towel at a gym is not something far-and-above what should be provided *by default* at a fitness establishment that is the 'caliber' of LA Fitness. I dont want to walk into LA fitness get my zumba on, sweat my *beautiful* black ass off, and then have no towel to dap my body down with. ON TOP OF THIS my ass works out in a silk/mesh/polyblend custom tailored free-form komono AND LET ME TELL YOU silk komono+mesh+sweat+no towel= absorbency disaster. It's like Grace Jones in concert when my ass is working out its a FULL PRODUCTION. SHIT.. now that I think about it.. 75% OF THE NACHO WORKOUT CONSISTS OF JUST DAPPING MY BODY DOWN IN AN EVER-SO-GENTLY AND SLIGHTLY SEDUCTIVE MANOR (depending on how many birds are staring at me in awe at that given moment).  The other other 15% goes to zumba another 5% for looking at myself in the mirror and the remaining 5% goes to an intense interval bursts of plyometric training. If there was such a thing as a 101% instead of 100% that extra 1% would go to the time I spend trying to holla at this fly spanish bird that makes the protein shakes. So my routine normally goes down zumba then dapper my body down then stretch then dapper my body down again then stare at myself in the mirror then protein shake and bake time then dapper my body down for the final most monumental time.  The only time I have a variation in my workout is when I workout with my 'trainer' Jose \"El Hamburglar\" Puentes.  Yes. His nickname is \"El Hamburglar\" cos he fat as hell and I dont even got to pay his fat ass I just buy him a bag of mcdonalds hamburgers and a cherry coke after every 'workout'.   You think nacho is actually gonna hire a REAL trainer? With actual Muscles? And make my black ass look bad?? Think again.. \"El Hamburglar\" not only enhances the visual experiences the ladies have when encountering a bronze God-like creature like myself at the gym but also just happens to be an excellent spotter when Nacho hits the squats.  It's the same effect you get with the ugly chick that only hangs out with other uglier chicks to make herself look pretty.  So..bottom line is..why you gonna make a gym this nice, with fly-ass white spanish asian and black birds, digital stop-watches on the walls (key to keeping up intensity when interval training), even a swimming pool, and then have NO TOWELS??  L.A. FITNESS. I have a fat mexican trainer with the nickname \"El Hamburglar\". He breaks a sweat just from drinking 'agua'. Towels are essential.
