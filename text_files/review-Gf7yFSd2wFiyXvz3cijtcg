They are dry, the frosting is way too sweet and it's so thick it's like paste, and the signature dot is completely inedible. It's also hugely overpriced. I think those milk cartons I drank in kindergarten are like 2 bucks here? I do think their cupcake mixes are great though, while still expensive. I like to fold in beaten whites like magnolia bakery does for a more airy cupcake. Final verdict: go across El Camino to Kara's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
