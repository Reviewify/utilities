Kinda dark, funky decor, decorated on the cheap. And it's comfortable, friendly, on the Ave. The coffee was very good, nothing to wax eloquent over, but very good. Service was friendly, competent, quick - just one college-aged guy on a weekday nite. The bookstore next door is worth a quick prowl. And, as an added bonus, there's often a medical response van parked out front. (Makes sense - they need to stay in the truck, and this way, they have wifi, nearby coffee, bathroom.)", "business_id": "eCjyvPJuS8-0Vzad8XuWcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-23", "type": "review"}
