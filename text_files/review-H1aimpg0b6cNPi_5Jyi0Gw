I was refinishing a table (sanding by hand) and for the polyurathane layer, the guy at the paint counter recommended this stuff that was a shortcut, that turned out to have ruined my table ... that I sanded and refinshed by hand.  Mind you, it was done.  I should have stopped.  But no, I wanted to protect my hard work -- and thanks to the advice I got at this Home Depot, ruined it.   Other examples:   I tried to seal the grout in my new shower enclosure and ended up buying 5 types of sealer, none of which was the right one -- again, thanks to the advice of the tile guys.  (Thanks, tile guy!) Also thanks to the tile guy:  i tried to buy a penetrating matte sealer for my slate floor and got ... a surface only sealant that will require me to scrape it off using a harsh acid to refinish with the appropriate penetrating sealant.  (I have by now selected some choice words for the tile guy...) When all is said and done, they do have the cheapest moving boxes around (67 cents for the small, and $1.37 for the large), but everything here is super cheap quality and expensive for what you get.   Oh, and don't listen to anything they tell you.  I promise you, they're wrong.", "business_id": "VPyapApQKaNcX0A5Yn7VCQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}
