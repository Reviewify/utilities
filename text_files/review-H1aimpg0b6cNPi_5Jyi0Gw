(thanks, tile guy!) also thanks to the tile guy: i tried to buy a penetrating matte sealer for my slate floor and got ... a surface only sealant that will require me to scrape it off using a harsh acid to refinish with the appropriate penetrating sealant. (i have by now selected some choice words for the tile guy...) when all is said and done, they do have the cheapest moving boxes around (67 cents for the small, and $1.37 for the large), but everything here is super cheap quality and expensive for what you get. oh, and don't listen to anything they tell you. i promise you, they're wrong.", "business_id": "VPyapApQKaNcX0A5Yn7VCQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}
