Was expecting to be a little busy, but there was only one other person in the restaurant at noon. There is a sushi bar, drinking bar, regular booth and table seating, and two teppan tables in back. Fairly nice ambience, with nice lighting and groovy fish tank posts. The room was a bit cold, but it was a really cold day.  The hostess was very friendly with us and our child. I think there was only one cook working when we came in, but the food came in a reasonable amount of time. The staff was very generous, bringing us bowls of soup, and a side dish for the vegetarian in our group. Our vegetarian really appreciated the wide variety of vegetarian options on the menu. My wife and I each had a beef bento box, which came with plenty of food: a salad, beef with vegetables, rice, and tempura veggie slices. The vegetables with the beef were a bit undercooked, but the beef was great, and I liked the salad dressing. We also had a shrimp sushi roll, which was excellent, if wrapped a bit loosely. Overall, we had a nice experience. The new prices are quite reasonable, and the staff was friendly. I have never been for the dinner menu, but the lunch menu was great!", "business_id": "iBRwl7sirmvg22AYnMPONQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}
