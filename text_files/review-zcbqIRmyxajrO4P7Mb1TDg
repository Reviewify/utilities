I was accompanied by two of my aunts to help with my task. At the end of a trying day, nerves frazzled, I made an executive decision. There would be no dinner of bellybusters and coffee milk. To Al Forno we did drive. It was still early, so we were seated promptly. For appetizers we ordered local oysters on 1/2 shell,and  mussels with frites, along with some good Belgium beer. For our entrees, we had braised beef rib ravioli,and a side dish of  roasted Brussels sprouts.The outstanding food is accompanied by outstanding service, which I would categorize as formal with a casual backbeat. The waitstaff make it a point of pride to know the menu, the origin of the ingredients, but they're not in your face about it. A nice end to a difficult day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fUBqSWOI5EkyXboVvov4hA"}
