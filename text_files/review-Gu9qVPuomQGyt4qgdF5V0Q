I ordered their Buffalo shrimp Caesar salad, which was average - I found the shrimp not to be very crispy (though it is breaded and deep fried, then tossed in buffalo sauce).  The lettuce and dressing were fine, but certainly this is not a dish that went well together - I would just get regular breaded shrimp next time.\n\nPrices are okay - about $12 for the salad, which is probably on the pricier side for lunch.  Service was average.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8ht957FWOJ4ryhseu8kzDQ"}
