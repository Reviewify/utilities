It's as solid as ever.\nPros:\nGood food\nGreat service - water glasses never even get half-empty\nFast, efficient service\nCons:\nIt's a loud place, so you may have to yell for your table-mates to hear you\nPortions (at least at lunch) are rather small for the price\n\nOverall, I like Spoon because it is always a safe bet - delicious food, great service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mFw45WXkOMByq4k2op0NIw"}
