It's as solid as ever. Pros: Good food Great service - water glasses never even get half-empty Fast, efficient service Cons: It's a loud place, so you may have to yell for your table-mates to hear you Portions (at least at lunch) are rather small for the price Overall, I like Spoon because it is always a safe bet - delicious food, great service.", "business_id": "mFw45WXkOMByq4k2op0NIw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-15", "type": "review"}
