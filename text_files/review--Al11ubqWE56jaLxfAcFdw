I rarely give 5 star reviews after only one visit to a business but I was very tempted to do so for Lynn Animal Hospital. It's the fourth vet I've been to in the last year. Based on this visit, though, I think I've finally found my vet.\n\nGreat service from Dr. Freed and the whole staff. Professional without being stuffy. Willing to share information without prattling on. Great, great dog handlers. Very fair pricing.\n\nI took two of my dogs in with small problems. Dr. Freed figured out a treatment plan for those problems and some preventative suggestions for improving their overall health. Along the way, he recommended different types of products but never pushed me to buy any particular thing or to buy it from Lynn.\n\nAll in all, I felt like my dogs got great care and I left with a really good impression about the services and philosophy of the business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "33_97u22YKjv-QLkKUlXJg"}
