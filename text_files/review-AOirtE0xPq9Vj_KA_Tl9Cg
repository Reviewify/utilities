I like my burgers plain so the fact that I didn't have to get anything on the burger made me really happy. I had no idea the regular burger was a double patty burger. I liked that they had Coke Zero and Sprite Zero in the soda machine choices. They don't have that option in most restaurant's soda machines.  It was crowded. The service was good. It was noisy at the inside tables. There are a good amount of tables outside so you can eat outside. I do plan to go back to Five Guys again.", "business_id": "s8_cb1ArVaRypkda__Gkvg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-19", "type": "review"}
