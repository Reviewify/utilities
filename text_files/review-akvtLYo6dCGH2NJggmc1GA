I called asking about a lens and was told there were 8 customers on the floor with the lone salesman and the guy I was talking to was in the lab.  I went in to see if they had what I wanted and the place was empty.... went from packed to nothing inside within 10 minutes.  The kid I was talking to seemed more set for a skateboard competition than camera sales.  He was talking to me about about people and places I've never heard of when he could't find the lens I wanted and I had to stop him to see what he was talking about.  He told me  to get a card and call him (Todd) the next day to see if the lens came in from the other store (no clue what store he was talking about).   I called the next day and was told the salesman (Todd) was tied up on the phone so the same guy I talked with the night before took my name and number and assured me the salesman would call me back immediately.  I wound up calling back 45 minutes later and spoke to the same guy once again who said nobody named \"Todd\" worked there.  I told him I just spoke with him and he was confused before saying something like \"Oh, yeah\".  I asked for the salesman and he told me was on the phone and couldn't get him.  The guy asked me what I was looking for and I told him and he tried to steer me to buy another lens because he didn't have what I wanted... phone shopping with these guys sucked.  I will steer clear of L Camera.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A_Dz4aDhgGrJew_S9HSzNg"}
