This is really border style Mexican and not true Mexican. Despite all this, I enjoyed eating here. The atmosphere is fun and social, a great shadow to go into on a hot Boston summer day. Service is very good. They clear your plates quickly without being impolite. The drinks are good. Margarita's not too strong, but that's OK. 4 stars is the most I'd give any Mexican place. I hate border style mexican food because it makes me tired and lazy. This place actually has one salad that will not fill you up: the Mesquite Grilled Salmon Salad. It's very good and light. The citrusy dressing was refreshing and not disgusting like the ranch that you see in most salads around here. The lettuce was also a surpise: not ice berg lettuce crap, but pretty good. The only thing I didn' t like were the microwaved stale nachos. A lot of the nachos were bendable which is a sign of poor cookmanship. All in all, fun place that I'd go to again. That says a lot considering I'd only eat Mexican food once or twice a year.", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-07-16", "type": "review"}
