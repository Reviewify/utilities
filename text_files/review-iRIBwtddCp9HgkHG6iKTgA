More like the FAIL house.  Yuk Yuk Yuk.\n\n\nOkay, I don't like when people review places that they didn't actually try but let me break it down for you.\n\nMy partner in crime and I had never been here and after reading the wonderful reviews we decided to check it out. From what I read it seemed like a place to relax, drink a good beer and perhaps make that bad decision to order some bar food and that's just what we were looking for. \n\n\nFirst of all, it's one of those places that everyone stops what they're doing and looks at you when you walk in.  \n\nObviously a townie bar.  \n\nI had to hover over people at the bar to check out the beer selection because they didn't have a list written anywhere else.\n\nMy findings were disappointing.   The beer selection was rather pitiful for a place called the Ale House. \n\nThere was a room in the back to sit but there was no direction if you could seat yourself or had to wait,  we would have asked someone but the only person who seemed to work there was chatting it up with the regulars.  \n\nIf you have read any of my other reviews you will know I don't mind crappy service or divey little hole in the walls IF there's something else to make up for it. \n\nSince there was not one beer either of us wanted to try,  we weren't hungry (and I don't eat chicken wings)  and the place was just too awkward so we just turned around and walked out.  ( We went to Holmes and Watson's if you were interested) \n\nI'm giving it two stars because I feel 1 star is too drastic for a place I was only in for 5 minutes and I'd be willing to give it another shot if someone who liked the place wanted me to go but I'll never return on my own accord.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qh-hU4JKEjF4kkSe0IGdSA"}
