( we went to holmes and watson's if you were interested) i'm giving it two stars because i feel 1 star is too drastic for a place i was only in for 5 minutes and i'd be willing to give it another shot if someone who liked the place wanted me to go but i'll never return on my own accord.", "business_id": "Qh-hU4JKEjF4kkSe0IGdSA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}
