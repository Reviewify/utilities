My coworkers and I went there for lunch just today, expecting great food. To start off, the service was mediocre since our waitress took forever to bring us the checks. Secondly, the bathroom was very dim, though sanitized. My biggest disappointment came from the food. I don't mind slow service if the food makes up for it. We ordered a Philly Cheesteak Sandwich with onion rings and a French Dip with French Fries. Both calimed to have \"thinly slices of meat\" but it was anything but thin and sliced. The bread was rather dry and lack flavor. Honestly, the best thing there was the Heinz ketchup. We ordered a slice of black forest cake and chocolate, fudge cake and both were also disappointing. Both slices were very dry, old tasting and warm. Overall, we will not be returning to this establishment and hope that you won't as well.", "business_id": "-tphABJRkegXV4Fr1ke4FQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-09-29", "type": "review"}
