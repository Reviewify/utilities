I have to give them 4 stars just for the fact that they carry West Coast Green Flash IPA. I don't know if other bars in town are scared to carry or what, but it's hard to find. And an excellent west coast style ipa, not as malty as the more american ipas. Enough about the beer though, I'm supposed to be reviewing the bar. It sides inside what looks like a small converted house. It's wood top to bottom inside and can get pretty packed. Best to just pop a squat outside at a picnic table and wait for a beer. Though pushing through the crowd inside has never stopped me. Service is usually pretty prompt. Some of the clientele are a little douchie, but that's the neighborhood. I get along well with others too so it's never an issue. Better crowd than the other bars on the street at least. Having discovered the Gingerman in NY, it was a welcome find upon arriving here to my new home in Houston.", "business_id": "IUm-Bh9up7n2hQigcylf7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}
