Located across the street from Toy Joy and Buffalo Exchange, Milto's is a great place to stop for lunch when out shopping on the drag.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\nThe building in clean, offers a private lot and the interior decor is simple classy and interesting.  It is never too hot in here or too cold and the place is always clean.\n\nSTAFF:\nStaff are quick, knowledgeable and will gladly explain the menu and it's various options to you with clarity and professionalism.  Delivery drivers are also very professional, actually carry adequate change and they are very quick.\n\nFOOD:\nIf you have read any of my previous reviews you would know I am a very harsh gyro critic so when I tell you that the gryos here at Milto's are some of the best in the area, I mean it!!  The gryos are great, the italian dishes are great.  The servings are decent size, well prepared, made with quality ingredients and fairly priced.\n\nCROWD:\nThis place can get very busy during the school year, so be prepared to wait a bit if it's a weekday around lunch time.  \n\nOVERALL:\nGreat food, great location, clean environment and did I mention that they deliver?\n\nCheck this place out if you are a fan of the Gyro, you'll love it.  Make sure you get the Feta added on there, it makes even more heavenly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YHI5RsnXxsmZcGv-vPMH3w"}
