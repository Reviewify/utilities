I've been to both locations (SLO and the one near Pismo Beach).  Both have been pretty crowded, although the one near Pismo usually has a line out the door. I've eaten my share of their clam chowder and even ordered some frozen to take back home.  If you can't make it down to the cafe, you can go on their website to have some clam chowder shipped to you!    OH, and now they sell their clam chowder at a couple of Costco stores - check out their website for more information.", "type": "review", "business_id": "frnSVqsuOOx_5VYV6H4Mew"}
