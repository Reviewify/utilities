The sauce was very good- definitely homemade, not the HFCS stuff from the bottle. It's not as sweet as the thick and dark styles, but its delicious, with a bit of heat. \n\nThe slaw is is vinegar, not mayo-based and mine was fresh and crisp. The cornbread was delicious- the description says it has chilies, beans, and meat in it, and I was imagining something with big chunks or almost like a baked sandwich- when it arrived it looked like a piece of thick cornbread, but when you bit into it the flavor was salty and smoky with just a hint of chile flavor- no discernible pieces of beans/meat. The potato salad was good, but not the best I've had. The baked beans were delicious, with a definite smokiness, NOT the sweet stuff you're used to from pot lucks or the can!\n\nDelicious BBQ!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9MnbQg7kfb_WgxoV0hXKSQ"}
