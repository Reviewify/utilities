It must of been what I ordered, but I did try my friends' food and tasted just a okay.  Before coming here I thought this place was Asian fusion, but it was fusion of everything. The decor, ambiance, and service was good, but the food could of been better. They had vietnamese, thai, malaysian, chinese, indian, italian, american. All types of fusion food.  I had:  Calamari: Just ordinary. It came w/ tartar sauce and sweet and sour source. I've had better down the street at Grappolo's, but they are closed =[.  Lettuce Wrap: It was just weird. Instead of giving us butter lettuce, they gave us romaine and expect us to wrap it with this long stem lettuce. I was confused. The lettuce didn't taste like anything either. I had their Sea Bass w/ Miso sauce as my entree/tapas plate. It came with lightly fried sea bass w/ greens and miso sauce. It was bland and tasted like nothing. The greens were bitter. I felt full, but unsatisfied.  I had also tried my friends' chow novo noodles. Overly salty and unauthentic.  This place did not impress me at all, and I will not come back. Just because it's a bit pricey for the ordinary food. I could of cooked better. There are places in the San Francisco w/ the same price which serves much better tasting food. I liked their decor and patio seatings (w/ heat). Perhaps I have high standard or it was just cooked wrong. No food really stood out that night. Many of us were disappointed with a big bill to pay.", "business_id": "C44mTlN9hDsy9CGlgRQ8sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-04-14", "type": "review"}
