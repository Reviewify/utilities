Hmmm the wife wanted a bubble tea while hanging out on the ave. The place was dead, maybe 2-3 customers sitting there, place was a mess tables w/ chairs out and napkins 'n trash everywhere. This stuff doesnt bother me. What does is my wife waiting in front of the cashier for literally 1 1/2 mins, not a watching lord of the rings type 90 seconds, but a George Constanza waiting for his conditioner to set in his hair 90 seconds. A very long time to completely ignore a customer who is right in front of you.... The young little lady was counting change and instead of putting customers first and taking her order or even acknowledging her with any actual words while she was there  is simply rude & unacceptable. But we did get a great big death glare as if we were bothering her as she went back to counting her change. There was another lady working there chatting w/ a guy who either also works there or is the b/f, hard to tell. Either way none of them were doing any work except for pissing off potential paying customers. Good for you, Im sure you dont care but Im sure the owner would. Oh well, clap clap clap. Good job.", "business_id": "3BG1niOE6fJiIIk1-04sjg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-30", "type": "review"}
