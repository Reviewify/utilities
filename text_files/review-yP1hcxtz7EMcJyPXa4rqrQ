Each time, their sign that brags on their warm biscuits caught my eye, but never enough for me to venture inside. Then one weekday morning, I decided....\"Today is the day\". As I walked inside, the smell of warm country goodness was overwhelming. The owner and the server/cooks, exchanged witty banter back and forth, and the environment was friendly. I sat at the counter since I was by myself, and began to peruse the menu... \"Business as usual\", I thought to myself. All the usual suspects are present on Bobby & Junes Kountry kitchen. I had to ask about their different types of ham. I cant remember the name, but apparently one is much saltier than a typical piece of ham. I chose both. Those along with scrambled eggs and bacon, I was all set up for success. I am not a biscuit person, so I cant even give a good review on that. But the food here is down right amazing. The service is fantastic the servers are very friendly, and the owners seem to have a great relationship with a lot of the regulars that come in. I love this place. It perhaps has some of the best breakfast in the city. Dont sleep....I know I wont.", "business_id": "Ic2xakPYKgM_Uma5hnLnFg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-19", "type": "review"}
