Each time, their sign that brags on their warm biscuits caught my eye, but never enough for me to venture inside.\n\nThen one weekday morning, I decided....\"Today is the day\".\n\nAs I walked inside, the smell of warm country goodness was overwhelming.  \n\nThe owner and the server/cooks, exchanged witty banter back and forth, and the environment was friendly.  I sat at the counter since I was by myself, and began to peruse the menu...\n\n\"Business as usual\", I thought to myself.\n\nAll the usual suspects are present on Bobby & Junes Kountry kitchen.  I had to ask about their different types of ham.  I cant remember the name, but apparently one is much saltier than a typical piece of ham.  I chose both.\n\nThose along with scrambled eggs and bacon, I was all set up for success.\n\nI am not a biscuit person, so I cant even give a good review on that. But the food here is down right amazing.\n\nThe service is fantastic the servers are very friendly, and the owners seem to have a great relationship with a lot of the regulars that come in.\n\nI love this place.  It perhaps has some of the best breakfast in the city.\n\nDont sleep....I know I wont.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ic2xakPYKgM_Uma5hnLnFg"}
