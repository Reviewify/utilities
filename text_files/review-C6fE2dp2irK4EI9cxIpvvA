After an exasperating hour and a half wait at another restaurant for food that never arrived, we retreated to Thelonious Monkfish, which happened to be across the street and, we knew, would serve us food that we liked. The main dinner rush was dwindling when we arrived at 9:25 p.m., and the owner greeted us. We exclaimed that we were starving and briefly told him about our horrible experience at the newly opened place across the street. His response was to give us a free appetizer, rush order. We chose the curry fries because they're vegetarian and sounded good. They were de-li-cious! The wait staff were attentive and on top of things. My friend and I split the special bacon pad thai (yummmmm!). Another friend got some excellent sushi, and our vegetarian friend got veggie drunken noodles. We were all tremendously satisfied and grateful. Thelonious Monkfish is the best!!", "business_id": "H_XBx4erPI4IrUo8WySPLg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-22", "type": "review"}
