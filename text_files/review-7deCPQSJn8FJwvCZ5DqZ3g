Yes, it is a novelty from the past when fast food was a new thing.   Forget the diet.  Forget the cholesterol.  Forget the fat.  Order up, find a place to consume and enjoy.   Been coming here since I was a kid. My Dad came here when he was a kid.   Forget the hamburgers.   The real deal here are the hotdogs.   Best bet are the chili dogs.  Get a side of finely chopped onions to pile on top.  Pair that with an order of Onion Rings and a Coca-cola...and you are all set.  Not a \"fast food\" person here, but will relent when it comes to those decadent Onion rings.  They are the best Onion rings in the world.  Like all the other food...they are meant to be eaten right away...hot/warm.", "business_id": "sPhPI3B6tvcJIULhICr-Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-11", "type": "review"}
