I would have to say YES... surprisingly I really enjoyed the food here.  I am a big time fan of Korean food and only used to the traditional \"grill it yourself\" places.  So when I walked in (have to say I was very impressed with the interior) and noticed there were no grills on the table, didnt think I was going to like it.   But when the food came out..., again I was surprised b/c it was Korean w/ a twist... first taste of the spicy cucumbers I didnt know how i felt about it b/c it was a bit different from what I was used to , but the more I ate... the more I started to like it.  The Galbee was good from the start... got to love that Galbee.  You have to try the Persimmon tea also.. thats some good stuff!  Although, I will never give up my traditional Korean food joints... I can say that Seoul Bros is something Im sure I'll have more often as it didnt leave me with that \"i just ate a whole cow\" smell and feel.  Seoul Bros is def more practical for everyday dinning and I give praise for the guys that started this new Korean BBQ remix.    oh yeah.. if I had a complaint.. it was that they had no TV for the laker game that was playing... GO LAKERS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "EAYBdA_ZWXcHmH9rYtIdHg"}
