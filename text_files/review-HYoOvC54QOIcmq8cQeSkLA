Especially so for its location in the U-District. The wafting smells of spicy meats and soups drew us in all the more from the downstairs.  My date and I were lucky enough to get one of last open tables as people continually checked in for a table.  Being vegetarian it can take a little modification on choosing a dish but I got the most delish veg Bimbimbap ever! Loaded with lots of veggies, soft sticky rice, the divine topping of egg and hot sauce! It came served in a huge hot metal bowl and I had plenty left over to scarf at home.  The service was great and very prompt in serving and refreshing our food and drinks.  Tastiest Korean food I've ever had!!", "business_id": "PFzF3dcRKGcziTf4KT0Skw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}
