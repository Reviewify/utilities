Especially so for its location in the U-District.\nThe wafting smells of spicy meats and soups drew us in all the more from the downstairs. \nMy date and I were lucky enough to get one of last open tables as people continually checked in for a table. \n\nBeing vegetarian it can take a little modification on choosing a dish but I got the most delish veg Bimbimbap ever! Loaded with lots of veggies, soft sticky rice, the divine topping of egg and hot sauce! It came served in a huge hot metal bowl and I had plenty left over to scarf at home.\n The service was great and very prompt in serving and refreshing our food and drinks. \n\nTastiest Korean food I've ever had!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFzF3dcRKGcziTf4KT0Skw"}
