If you're a food snob looking for authentic or good Korean food, you're probably not going to want to spend your time here. But when you have that craving for Korean and don't want to lug yourself all the way down to the 30s or Queens, this place can hit the spot. The soon du bu is rather bland but I order it anyways because it is one of my favorite Korean dishes. Meat dishes are usually wonderful and they do provide the lettuce to wrap the meat and the sauces as well to garnish. I believe they don't let you cook at your table at certain times, so sometimes you have to order from the kitchen. Fried Mandoo is tasty as is the Bulgogi. Every time I am there, I am surrounded by Columbia students and neighborhood folks eating bimbimbap. In fact, I think most of the restaurant guests are not that adventuresome and only order that every single time they go. My bf and I often get strange looks from other guests for eating the meat dishes--but definitely go the extra mile and try these! They randomly serve Lime Rickeys but can be tasty as accompaniment to the spicy flavors in the dishes. So basically, worth it if you're too lazy to go downtown. I typically make the effort once a month to eat in Ktown. (I like Shilla and The Mill pales in comparison.) The staff has never been rude to me. It just often gets overrun by hoardes of hungry people and it's probably a cultural difference that others might be misinterpreting for \"rudeness\".", "business_id": "DgHEzcSBotbfxW-IJPAMuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-02-03", "type": "review"}
