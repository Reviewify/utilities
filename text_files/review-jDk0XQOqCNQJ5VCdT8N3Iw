(i like shilla and the mill pales in comparison.) the staff has never been rude to me. it just often gets overrun by hoardes of hungry people and it's probably a cultural difference that others might be misinterpreting for \"rudeness\".", "business_id": "DgHEzcSBotbfxW-IJPAMuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-02-03", "type": "review"}
