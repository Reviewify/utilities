They were gentle and very thoughtful in drawing the blood of my 5 month old.\n\nBut, the lab office procedures were terrible.   The lab lost my doctor's request and we waited for 30 minutes as the employees looked everywhere for it.  They found it and said that it was filed in the least likely cabinet.  \n\nThey did a great job of drawing blood.  My baby cried very little.  \n\nThen they said the results would be ready the next day.  It wasn't.  Nor the day after that.  I called and they said that the results would be delayed because their internist was away and the lab results had to be returned to the \"east coast\"!!!  \n\nI could not fathom what was going on and told the customer service rep just to fax whatever she had to my doctor.  She said that she would.  \n\nI call my doctor later in the day and of course, they didn't get any fax.  I call back LPCH and talk to another customer service person who said that it wasn't faxed over earlier.  \n\nThey faxed it finally and we got the results.   \n\nGreat lab technicians, but really poor office management.  Get your lab work done elsewhere!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5wCrlH4DKc6SAElil7aD6Q"}
