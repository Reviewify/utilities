If you are looking to loose some pounds and want to do it around some 18 year old Harvard blondies, then this is the place for you (and me).  The only catch is that you need to be a Harvard affiliate.  Now this isn't as difficult as it sounds since the term partner is pretty lax now a days.  All you need is a joint lease, bank account, or some mail (additionally you usually need to sign a piece of paper declaring your interdependent relationship; but hey, if you are that cheap you wont mind).\n\nThe gym has everything you would expect from a gym, including a nice towel service.  The most rocking thing here, aside from the girls' bodies, would have to be the fact that all of the cardio equipment have built in tvs.  You heard it here, now you can watch some food network while burnin' your fat ass.  Now there is a 20 minute time limit on the machines, but it turns out that you (and the person who tries to kick you off of your machine) are the only people who follow it.  People also don't always wipe down the machines when they are done, but if you don't mind kicking people off and cleaning your machine before you use it, then by all means.\n\nThe complex is quite sizable.  Did I mention that there are TWO cardio rooms?  There are also basketball courts, personal trainers, two pools, an indoor cycling studio, and a place where classes are held.  I would definitely suggest taking a  step class (you will figure out why soon enough).  You can thank me later.  Not just cardio equipment, there are also three weight rooms.\n\nBottom Line: Its not like you have to kiss each other in front of the membership people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "97V9BW79WJpiqQ4vBBXa8w"}
