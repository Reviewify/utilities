Great location. Setup isn't as monolithic as Costa Verde. Once in awhile service at the leasing office is nice (a bit useless since they're tied up in red tape 99.9% of the time). CONS: THE APARTMENT AND \"AMENITIES\": Old old old kitchen appliances that leak and fill vegetable drawers with water and dishwashers that leak dirt specked water, horrible bathroom ventilation (so moldy ceilings start QUICKLY), locks getting loose after a few weeks, neighbors with no realization of how loud they are. Tiny parking spots but I knew what I was coming in to for that one at least. THE LEASING COMPANY/ALL THIRD PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT: Delegating maintenance to a helpless third party, 72 hour period for a bug problem that is freaking out my roommate (see the second picture for this place!), not even coming out to check the apt out in the first place for a floor problem (I had to call a couple times before to get our cheap linoleum flooring replaced!), thefts happening due to a non-existent gate and useless security guard, and major attitude from staff. You get what you pay for, but I did not know I'd live that motto to THIS EXTENT. My old apartments have their own flaws but....SO MUCH BETTER. There isn't that accumulation of failure that seems to follow La Regencia and their half-assed duct-tape approach to \"fixing\" and \"maintaining\" their complex.", "business_id": "kBRXe9SWbuSfIlA_WriCww", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-29", "type": "review"}
