This place used to be really low priced for how good it was.  Apparently management has caught on.  There can be pretty long waits if its crowded and the place is pretty small.\n\nI do enjoy the food here though and recommend the hummus and grape leaves.", "type": "review", "business_id": "grtRbOhjogmnTXToPwFoNQ"}
