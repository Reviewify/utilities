I still haven't tried Kogi so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was pretty good. I had one beef and one pork taco and it set me back $4.40 which isn't too bad, but not that cheap considering the fact that the food court near where the truck was parked had galbi tang for $4.99.\n\nI preferred the prok over the beef one. The pork was spicier than i expected (that stilll doesn't mean it was spicy, just more than what i had thought it'd be) and was pretty soft. The mound of lettuce both the taco's were a little over-powering since they're marinated in basically soy sauce and sugar. Almost lost flavor of the meat (more on the beef than pork). The beef was a bit disappointing as it was kind of bland and just smokey tasting. Plus, there was less meat on the beef taco (i guess because beef more expensive...?). The size of the tacos were pretty big, but half of the taco is just lettuce. \n\nOverall, if I'm hungry and this is nearby, i'll def. try again~", "type": "review", "business_id": "lIPv3-ocdPvkiiE6JaQi9w"}
