I use to frequent here at least twice a week, but now I do not have that kind of money anymore. \n\nUpside: Great chicken, perhaps the best I've ever had. They fry it right when you order. teri-q wings are the best . Friendly service. \n\nDownside: They dont open on sundays. You have to pay for additional sauce. Its quite pricey for fried chicken", "type": "review", "business_id": "h2XXaRsW_0qxuAl7OUjhSg"}
