It's so much better, so much more sophisticated, so much more interesting.\n\nThe nicest people, and amazing food. Always great seasoning, fresh ingredients, and awesome soup. Inexpensive, too.\n\nMuch love for Jaffa. I once ate here almost daily when I worked directly across the street. They figured out I was a regular real quick, and always treated me accordingly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVvJdMA7xdllVEEeXjngjw"}
