The first time, we really thought we'd found a gem. The little patio in back was nice, the piped-in music was nicely chill, and the food was better than decent. All this promised a nice extended love affair with the place, but having gone back a couple of times, I could shorten this review to one word: disappointing. Some specifics: Avoid the breakfast pizza that is prominently pictured on their homepage. It's a disgusting, soggy mess. The steak hash is consistently too salty. But if you're in a forgiving mood, the laid-back brunch pace and $1 mimosas make up for some of Sagra's failings.", "business_id": "aEhrDSlHNgfILuF9kSuX5g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-11", "type": "review"}
