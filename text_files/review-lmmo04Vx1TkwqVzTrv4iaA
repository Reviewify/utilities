I have been to Chipotle's competitor while living in Seattle and loved it there and since they don't have it here, I had to check out Chipotle since I've heard good things! My friends were definitely right in recommending this place to me because I love a good quality burrito on the go! I was pleased by this location, it was small, but service was friendly, quick, and there were a decent amount of places to sit down and eat inside. Their menu is a bit small compared to other places of this caliber and I was really craving a chicken quesadilla, but they didn't have that here. I tried a burrito bowl instead and it was really tasty and appropriately priced! Their chicken has a sweet flavor that I really enjoyed and I highly recommend putting some of their corn on your food as well, gives it a nice flavor! I kind of wish they had more options on their menu, but other than that, it's clean, fresh, quick, and tasty. I'll definitely return to try more of their burritos again!", "business_id": "tzRNk1hqooBV3i-Q_yKP7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}
