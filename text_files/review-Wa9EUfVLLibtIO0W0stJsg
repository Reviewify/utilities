Went up to counter directly across from 3 employees only to have none of them acknowledge our existence.   Wanting to make the best of a soon-to-be-bad situation,  I claimed a dirty but vacant table.in the corner by the door and went off in search of a high.chair.   by the time I had retrieved the chair and returned the table was being cleared.   Afterwards, the service was polite and efficient.  The food was simple, but delicious.  --Word to the wise: \"pigs in a blanket\" has no pigs.
