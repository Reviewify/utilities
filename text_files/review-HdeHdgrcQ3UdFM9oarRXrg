The problem with Chipotle is consistency and quality control. They could be much better if they simply cared more about how they assemble their burritos. They use good, organic ingredients. Their corn salsa, for example, is quite tasty. The ingredients are unfortunately just randomly thrown into the burrito without any regard for quantity or placement. There have been countless times when I have taken a few bites containing nothing but guacamole and sour cream. I once ordered a barbacoa+carnitas burrito that ended up being 90% rice. The net result is mediocre burritos. I have simply had much better ones.  I have eaten over 10 burritos at Chipotle, and will probably eat a lot more during my time in Berkeley. Their awesome online ordering system is simply too convenient to pass. It is great for group orders because it sends an email to everyone in the group to notify them of the group order. Individuals can then choose what they want to add to the order. If you can't resist the convenience of their online ordering system, you might have to give Chipotle a try. Just be warned that you might end up with disappointing burrito.", "business_id": "tzRNk1hqooBV3i-Q_yKP7g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-08", "type": "review"}
