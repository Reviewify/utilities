Believe it or not, I really like the place because it reminds me of the house I grew up in.  The bar area resembles the backyard with the old tree, and the lounge resembles my living room.   The food is so-so, but their specialty drinks are worth a try.  Five stars for its ambience during the day and early evenings, three stars for its food.", "business_id": "WbghvrJETTvt9p7nPcfjAQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-30", "type": "review"}
