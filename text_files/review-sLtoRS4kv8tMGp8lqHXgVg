It was a step above fast fast food Falafel making it much better than Maoz. Yet it still fell a step below places like Alyan's (probably biased because everything does to my taste buds). It delivered on fresh ingredients and had an addicting hummus. The only flaws I found was that the Falafel balls were big enough to push all of the other ingredients towards the back of the sandwich instead of it being a little more spread out. The \"hot\" sauce also left a lot to be desired. I also picked up fries on the side, and for a middle eastern place they were much better than I expected them to be. They easily made my top ten in fact. seasoned to perfection with all kinds of spices. good with ketchup but better without. Hummus is a spot that I'm definitely keeping my eye on in the future.", "business_id": "bgxDswHIdFP0Go0pNfyAAw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-15", "type": "review"}
