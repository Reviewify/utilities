The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the roof deck, and the people who work here know it. In other words, they think they can get away with being jerks because of that... well I guess they can get away with it. As far as Boston/Cambridge places go, it's average. In other words, not that great. I'm starting to get fed up with the poor service in Boston. 1st time I went here, it was for lunch on the roof deck. It was decent food, average service, but a bit pricey for what it was in my opinion. Honestly the waiter wasn't half bad, but everyone else that was working there gave off that \"I'm better then you vibe\". Reminded me of high school. Second time was for drinks. Thought I could have a few drinks on the roof deck. Nope. Offered to buy appetizers. Nope. Each person involved HAD to buy an entree they say. Again that same uppity vibe. So we went to the crowded bar upstairs and looked at all the empty tables on the roof deck instead. Where they had no chairs and constantly had to move out of the way for the busboy, waitress, etc. Beer selection was good, pretty standard with some quality beers. Pretty clean place too, nice construction with a lot of stained wood. Bartender was not great, first thing she told us was if we had an out of state ID she needs to see two forms of ID. I hate when they do this. But they did get our drinks pretty quick. The place got kinda busy by the time they left. Not too sure about the people there. Standard Boston types I guess. Who am I to judge.", "business_id": "E_vKoJ0zvpfAcEkQGS4d2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-16", "type": "review"}
