Though they don't take reservations at an 8 o'clock on a monday night we were all set to walk right in and sit down. We had called earlier in the day to let them know we were coming in and the manager Rachel answered the phone and was very sweet! The wait staff was great! Our server was so sweet and personable we all wanted to invite her over for cake after dinner! The food was amazing, I had the chicken salad with a pecorino dressing which was awesome! The flatbreads were great and the mussels were good too! They gave the birthday girl (21!) a second drink on the house (excellent sangria!) and brought out a brownie and ice cream for her with a candle without us even asking. We were all raving by the time we left (the music was awesome too, picked out by our waitress). Definitely a place to back to a lot! Good prices for the food, we are all college students and didnt want to spend a lot. So impressed!", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-16", "type": "review"}
