The service was quick and the two guys behind the counter were friendly and warm. However, the falafel was clearly in the fryer for too long, as it was very burned, chewy, and almost inedible. The Syrian bread that accompanied my falafel plate was very stale also. Folks, this place pales in comparison to Rami's or Shawarma King in Coolidge Corner. Seriously if you want good falafel, make your way to Brookline and skip Moody's altogether.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9qCjkJvgnpzOjKLodDEMxw"}
