I went to this place for the first time last night and got a Pesto Calzone (Chicken, Mozzerella, Ricotta, & Pesto) and it was delicious!  The chicken was a little dry and it wasn't overflowing with it - but the \"healthy\" amount of cheese in the calzone made up for it.  My boyfriend got the sausage calzone and that was pretty yummy, too (I had a bite -- the sauce was just a little sweet though).  The total came to $13.03 for two big calzones -- not too shabby! And they're open late which is cool too -- we went there around 11 pm and it was pretty busy.  Oh, and their water didn't taste dirty -- which is a plus for me, especially compared to other places around Berkeley.", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-03-16", "type": "review"}
