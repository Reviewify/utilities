Right on Mass ave and re-branded themselves with very savvy logo.\n\nThey souped up the decor and atmosphere heavily toward fitness gym. It's very, very clean. Equipped with newly redone bathroom and shower. \n\nThey have a full size ring, wall-to-wall padded floor and the wall. This is like my dream gym.\n\nNot only they upgraded their facility, but also did to their program. On top of kickboxing/kung fu program they originally had, they now offer wrestling and Brazilian jujutsu.\n\nAs said earlier, it's located right on Mass ave. The entrance is in between Dunkin Donuts and the liquor store. It doesn't even take a minute from T-stop! How convenient is that!?", "type": "review", "business_id": "6EB64SrQIE-QZx_kZN_1jQ"}
