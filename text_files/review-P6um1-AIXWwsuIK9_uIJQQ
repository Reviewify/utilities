Right on Mass ave and re-branded themselves with very savvy logo. They souped up the decor and atmosphere heavily toward fitness gym. It's very, very clean. Equipped with newly redone bathroom and shower. They have a full size ring, wall-to-wall padded floor and the wall. This is like my dream gym. Not only they upgraded their facility, but also did to their program. On top of kickboxing/kung fu program they originally had, they now offer wrestling and Brazilian jujutsu. As said earlier, it's located right on Mass ave. The entrance is in between Dunkin Donuts and the liquor store. It doesn't even take a minute from T-stop! How convenient is that!?", "business_id": "6EB64SrQIE-QZx_kZN_1jQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-14", "type": "review"}
