Stopped in for a quick bite after the gym and it was better than I anticipated. Maybe it's really worthy of 3 stars and the additional star is because I was starving, but the pizza was solid, the garlic bread not bad (albeit a bit too greasy, and I'm not sure what from, but it wasn't garlic or the typical spices) and the grab-n-go tex mex salad was flavorful. Service was accommodating, as I was pretty out of it and they beared (bore?) with me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K-wyXXi5lPM2cwaV9_vXcQ"}
