I was on my way to another vintage/thrift store farther down on Colorado when I spotted this sign. I purchased two blouses and got one free (promotion, don't know if its only for today or if its a normal, ongoing deal) for a total of eighteen dollars. Positives: I really liked that they sorted the denim separately from the other clothing - even separating denim jackets, from sleeveless denim. The non-denim blouses were separated by color, which was also very nice. The same thing with the dresses, all separated by color. There's a nice selection of shoes and boots! They have dressing rooms with a door (not a curtain as you have in some places). The young lady at the counter was very nice and directed me to the downstairs (I didn't know about the other floor). Lots of merchandise! great prices. Negatives: the downstairs, but others have already mentioned it (not significant and I'll return).", "type": "review", "business_id": "g1eemH_57M0936npvAUfoQ"}
