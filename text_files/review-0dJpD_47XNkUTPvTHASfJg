I got to try a huge variety of dishes with a big group of friends who knew what they were ordering. All dishes were great! My favorites were Beef in Hot Broth, Shredded Pork w/Seasoned Tofu, Braised Pork Shoulder, Mao's Pork, and Double Cooked Pork Belly. Off the appetizers, one of the Bean Jelly Noodles was delicious, and Honey Pork Ribs were also great. I know I just listed a ton of dishes, because they were all awesome! I'm actually not great at handling spicy foods, but everything was very flavorful with the right amount of spice for me, and I didn't have too many problems afterwards :). Of course, you might want to steer clear if you have acid reflux, but they do have some good non-spicy dishes available, like the Braised Pork Shoulder & Honey Pork Ribs. Finally, the prices may seem a little steep, but they offer many dishes in two sizes. The larger one is HUGE and the smaller portion is fairly regular-sized. The appetizers are pretty big as well. They also put out a complimentary little plate of either fried wonton skins or Chinese style boiled peanuts for you to snack on before your meal. Definitely recommend ordering family style and sharing dishes.", "business_id": "7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-07", "type": "review"}
