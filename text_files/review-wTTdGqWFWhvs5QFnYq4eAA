I love burgers, so I was happy!  Parking is as it always is in downtown SLO, so bring change for meters (meters take credit cards now too! weird.) We came on a Tuesday early afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all! Not creepily empty, but a couple other tables full and a few people at the bar. The server was very attentive and really friendly, which is always nice!  My mom, my sister, and I all got the Guinness burger, with avocado and cheese and bacon somehow varied on our burgers (Favorite women know how to eat well), and they were really good! Cooked well, though next time I will ask for medium, and great flavor! I loved that the bun is toasted. The fries are good, too, with seasoned salt on them. The chicken tortilla soup is GREAT, very flavorful with excellent spice in it. I would get that next time I come.  The price is what I would expect, not cheap but not really expensive. Plan on spending about twelve bucks for the burger, probably about fifteen dollars per person if you just get a meal. Not too bad!  They don't take American Express, and card has a ten dollar minimum!  I have a feeling it gets more crowded around dinner time or on weekends, because this place seems good and well-liked, but for good reason.", "business_id": "P_J9-_UVjX3uhv1Sas9Kaw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-31", "type": "review"}
