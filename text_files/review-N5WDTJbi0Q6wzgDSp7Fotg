I ordered the shrimp & pork dumpling soup. The broth was quite tasty but I feel the meat insides could have used more flavor. I also ordered the scallion pancakes which were delish!...A little on the greasy side but I'm a girl who doesn't dab her pizza if you know what I mean. Service was also on the slow side--delivery orders were going out 10x as fast as sit-down dining :-/ Bottom Line: I'm not rushing back here, but if a friend wanted to go I guess I wouldn't mind too much.", "business_id": "CWk6yFOoKJH5URub5XsHDg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-23", "type": "review"}
