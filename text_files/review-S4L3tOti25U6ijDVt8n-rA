We got 6 different cupcakes and 1 doggie cupcake,  I have only eaten the key lime cupcake and it was fantastic!  I can't wait to try the others.  When we got home I gave my fur baby her cupcake and she gobbled it up!  That really says alot because she is very picky about homemade treats.  The only downside is that they are $3.50 each.  I would go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
