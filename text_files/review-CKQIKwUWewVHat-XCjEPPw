I never cared for the pinkberry that was here before.  The flavors at this place are simply wonderful!!  I generally try their newer flavors with the little tasting cups, but really my favorite are the tart flavors.  The plain tart is the best one I've had around; HOWEVER!!!, the pomegranate raspberry is by far my most favorite flavor ever!!  They have a nice selection of toppings (my personal faves are strawberries, mangoes and yogurtchips, and mochi!) I keep coming back here for the pomegranate raspberry and doubt I would care to come as often if they took that flavor away from me.  I hope a locations opens in torrance (i think there is one  coming soon!! crossing fingers!!)", "business_id": "NxmRPUDi2UGnj6moH0mKAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-28", "type": "review"}
