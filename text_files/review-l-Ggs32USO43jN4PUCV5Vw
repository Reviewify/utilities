He has a lovely bedside manner, very friendly, cordial, highly informative and he took plenty of time to talk to me. He prescribed a specific medication and did something no other physician has ever done for me. He called me at home to follow up on getting the prescription filled. Dr. Pai is an exceptionally dedicated and caring dermatologist. One in a million! Highly recommended.
