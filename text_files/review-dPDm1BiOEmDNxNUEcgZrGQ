[yeah i said it] first off, they have a limited amount of flavors. i brought my mom here after hyping up the awesomeness of self serve froyo, and she left pissed. also, whoever the hell is working there in the back needs to realize they need to refill those machines continuously. i swear, every single spout took forever dispensing yogurt, i only got a few drops of each flavor. since the machines were taking so long, the process took way longer than necessary and the few drops of yogurt i got in the beginning were already melting by the time i got to the toppings area. boooo. hopefully they step their game up and get their shit right, because it would be fairly awesome to have a good self serve froyo place in the hoooood.", "business_id": "Hhfga62zdR5TxuqtleNHCg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-04", "type": "review"}
