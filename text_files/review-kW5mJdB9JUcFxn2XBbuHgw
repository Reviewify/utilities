I'm not a vegetarian, but some of the veg dishes are very appealing, and there's a wide variety of non-veg menu items. The turkey burger--which can be prepared with any of the condiments on the regular burger list--is an easy favorite, as are the spicy black-eyed pea cakes (also available on a sandwich), which have a nice little kick. I also recommend the fish and chips--very light and flavorful. While I don't drink much beer anymore, I appreciate the array of brews available. I did try a bloody mary here a time or two, and unfortunately, I wasn't taken with it. Very dull, not much spice or distinctive flavor. Wait times can be extensive when they're busy, but the staff has always been courteous and responsive, in my experience. The canine-themed decor in the restroom(s) is a hoot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cfonr0hg-2hz1yUkoDwx-w"}
