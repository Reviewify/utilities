I quit doing business with Memorial Herman because of predatory billing and this is another example. The trouble with rating Memorial Herman is that there is no way to rate their system, and if you are going to be gouged it doesn't matter which of their hospitals you attend, from the Taj Mahal on Fannin to their other monuments to grandiosity (Gessner @ I-10). That's where your overcharges are going.\n\nSure the staff is nice, but their business is based on overcharging.\n\nJust because Blue Cross is complicit in giving them the fee increases that they ask for doesn't make it any less outrageous. If you do enough business with them there will be unpleasant surprises. Ask for estimates for service and detailed statements IF YOU HAVE TO USE THEM AT ALL.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sQAmn3-0DR3EhHLEmbwruQ"}
