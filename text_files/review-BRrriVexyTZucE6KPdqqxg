Nick, the owner, was very friendly and considerate of my feelings, as I was a bit scared at first to go under the needle.  He worked freehand from a photo that I brought in, and while he insisted on making some artistic changes to my design, they turned out to be for the better.  I have more tattoos now, but my first is still my favorite.  The color has held up nicely over almost 10 years.  I'm hoping to travel back down to Champaign for a new tattoo from Mark of Cain!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8TYYgL3bFEZVd1QuJMdl8w"}
