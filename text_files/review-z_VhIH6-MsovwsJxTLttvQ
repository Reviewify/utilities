They use this weird machine in there and I still don't really know what it is but it makes the fillings in my teeth feel funny... and also does a fantastic job of cleaning my skin out. No need for tons of painful extractions! My facials at Sasha have been the best I've ever had, 1) because of that weird face cleaning machine and 2) Erika is super cool. She is a great conversationalist, actually listened when I told her what was going on with my skin, and recommended (but didn't push) some products that actually worked.", "business_id": "fz7o2gYjqxyKMfLK1jYODg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-25", "type": "review"}
