My wife and I came here for dinner. Service is slow and friendly. Prices are very low. Food is amazing. Second best chicken tikka masala ever. (First best is at Delhi Garden in Edison). Palak paneer tastes super fresh. I also recommend the garlic naan and aloo paratha. Almost all dishes are under $10.", "business_id": "QnLmcioGcNhKEsYRTtg0hw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-29", "type": "review"}
