I was a little early for my appointment, but I patiently waited. Unfortunately my appointment started 10 minutes later than when I had originally scheduled it. The manicure itself wasn't so great, and within a day started chipping away. I did however get the best 5 minute hand treatment/massage, and that was probably the best part. I think they're probably good for haircuts, facials and massages, but if you're looking just for manicure, you should probably try somewhere else. I would've given them a 2 but really enjoyed speaking to their staff.", "business_id": "iIei8--uHauhigv4SLqpJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-29", "type": "review"}
