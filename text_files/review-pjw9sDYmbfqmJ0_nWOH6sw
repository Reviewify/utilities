I cook a lot of Korean food myself and I'm probably a bit picky when it comes to Korean food. I've tasted every Korean food restaurant available around Providence area, from food truck, delivery to restaurants. While the quality of food greatly vary from place to another (and also over time), I recently had a great experience from my first visit to Teriyaki House. The restaurant is very spacious with high ceiling. There were about three waiters/waitresses. Three kinds of default side dishes were provided, and the waiter didn't mind giving us refills without extra charge. (He even took away a side dish with some food on it and gave us a fresh new one. He didn't have to do that, I really don't like wasting food!) I really liked cucumber kimchi which is provided as one of the default side dish. Food was cooked with care, with appropriate seasoning. We tried fried dumplings with teriyaki sauce and bulgogi with octopus. Both are highly recommended. The bulgogi and octopus was excellent in the way they were cooked and served; my only wish was that octupus would've been cooked just a little bit less since it was little bit chewy on certain areas.  Out of all Korean food places around the town so far, I can say that my favorite was from this place.  Price is about what you would expect from Korean restaurants around the town. I was satisfied with the quantity of food we (1 guy 1 girl) got with one main dish and one appetizer. No one really knows about this place and this place is always almost empty, which worries me. I would hate to see this place close down... I still need to try other menus.", "business_id": "nWu8OljDYmLfbLQqcfW9Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-27", "type": "review"}
