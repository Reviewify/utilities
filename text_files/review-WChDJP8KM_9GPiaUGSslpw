Tony Maws continues to reliably put out incredible food.  The space is alive with energy, but has plenty of quieter spaces where you can pay full attention to your food if you wish to.\n\nMost of the staff seem to really love the food and take pride in  providing a great experience in a top notch restaurant. \n\nSuggestions:    Avoid peak hours as Craigie can get a little zooey.  Also, consider some of the off-hours pice fixe specials - such as the late Sunday (after 9PM) Chef's whim and the pre-theater dpecials.", "type": "review", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"}
