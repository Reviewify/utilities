The restaurant is much, much, MUCH cleaner than the norm for the area (don't get me wrong, I love the Durant food ghetto even though I neither attend school nor live in Berkeley any longer... but \"clean\" isn't the strong suit of the eateries in this neighborhood). As far as the food, I'd love to be able to write an extensive review, but I ordered the Chicken Shwerma wrap on recommendation the first time I went and I liked it so much I've eaten the same thing every time since. It's tasty, with the perfect balance between meat & veg, spicy & subtle. Parking's a huge problem, but again it comes with the territory.", "business_id": "WaxhDYWQmZ1FGM2ChY7_2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-03-12", "type": "review"}
