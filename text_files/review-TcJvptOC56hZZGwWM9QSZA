Awesome! Definitely a fun way to work out with really energetic instructors and lots of options, even belly dancing and yoga and the ab lab that made me want to puke tonight.\n\nNot a fan of the weight room. Advise from a former UT personal trainer (oh that's me): work out at the Rec Center, not Gregory, if you're doing a traditional workout (some cardio and some weights). \n\nBut if you love swimming or just generally hanging out  at a beautiful pool, Gregory is where it is at! I have never seen a better pool. Probably somewhere has Greg beat, but I haven't been there yet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vc2Bum2KWfN1ZvHpROBM9Q"}
