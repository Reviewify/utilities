It has to be chewy and a tad sweet. Boba cannot be soft and bland. That just won't fly. Boston Tea Stop has it just right. Their boba is chewy without being too hard and has a bit o sweetness. They have a wide selection of tea, slushie, and smoothie flavors. I tried the mango slushie and it was very refreshing. The jasmine milk tea was also very good. The place is small with just three tables and some chairs, so it's good for grab n go. It may be hard to find because it's tucked away a bit. I would recommend this place to anyone.", "business_id": "ch1ercqwoNLpQLxpTb90KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-10", "type": "review"}
