Yes, it's run by the \"Thai Nazi\"--(not in regards to her demeanor, but more so because she runs this place like the Soup Nazi a la Seinfeld).  But damnit, I miss my little dinky Thai Cafe. Don't be scared off by the huge line that you'll find outside during lunch.  Like I said above, it's run pretty Soup Nazi-esque, so the line goes SUPER quick.  Just be prepared when you order! From what I remember, it was open 11am-2pm.  They're cash only, so be prepared.  For a relatively filling meal, the price is reasonable at $6--or $6 as I hear from friends who go there now...it was still $5 back in my day (ha, I feel old) when I went there a few years ago. The shrimp soup, chicken soup, and curry special are my favorites.  The salads aren't bad, but I usually don't get them because most of the time, I prefer food that's temperature hot.  I'm not sure if it's authentic Thai, but whatever it is, it's tasty!   It's great on the go when you're a busy student running from place to place.", "business_id": "YmupeGDFKFLPfPUAe6aarQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-13", "type": "review"}
