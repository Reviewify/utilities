From what I hear, other shops on Chorro are now getting more business because of the traffic Luna Red brings.  \n\nFrom the best raw oysters in town, to the home made corn bread baked to order, to the signature pre-prohibition libations, to the fresh tapas lovingly prepared and sourced from local farms, to the desserts and right down to one of the best espressos I've had anywhere.  A week later from the day we ate there (8/8/12) and I'm still thinking enough to write this.  \n\nCouple that with outstanding people who really love what they do and care to make your special evening the best and there you have it!  Thanks Luna for another wonderful anniversary dinner!", "type": "review", "business_id": "A6p0E-nFupEjDKpKx45CIQ"}
