Great food. I've had indian cuisine in across the US and really love this place. Relaxing atmosphere, service is wonderful and servers are very knowledgable. For some reason, I rarely order fish at Indian rests. but I ordered the halibut and it was soo tender-cooked perfectly excellent seasoning. Masala Chai is superb. Chicken Tikka Masala, one my favorite dishes, again great. Next time I will order the Daal. I'm frugal but it was worth every cent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KYuvV5AsoaSwa68_7ktAPw"}
