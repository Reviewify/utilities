They really have flavor ranges and styles to satisfy any pallet. BEERS, BEERS, BEERS - MY STYLE & THEIRS: I happen to love the dark, Russian Imperial and other dark styles that are on the sour side. I have noticed that many of their beers tend to have a sweet finish to them on some level. Also, there are a few beers that will cater to the \"I love hops\" crowd, but maybe one or two. The majority of their selection is well above par, and tends not to \"over-hop\". (You won't get a Sam Adams type here- sorry hop lovers). Although I love dark beers (the blacker the color the better), I tend to love Hefeweissen in the summer, as it's a nice clean, citrusy splash to any hot day. IMPORTANT TIP: Overall, great place to get great beer. You MUST try the Sour Blonde if they have it in their \"special bottles\" section when you go. They cellar a finite amount of that brew if/when they make it, but it is one of my favorites. I also love the smoked beer that I have nicknamed \"Bacon Beer\" as it tastes like bacon in a glass.
