(you won't get a sam adams type here- sorry hop lovers). although i love dark beers (the blacker the color the better), i tend to love hefeweissen in the summer, as it's a nice clean, citrusy splash to any hot day. important tip: overall, great place to get great beer. you must try the sour blonde if they have it in their \"special bottles\" section when you go. they cellar a finite amount of that brew if/when they make it, but it is one of my favorites. i also love the smoked beer that i have nicknamed \"bacon beer\" as it tastes like bacon in a glass. enjoy!", "business_id": "HMQ_PUJR6y01NOoS2_vJdA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-20", "type": "review"}
