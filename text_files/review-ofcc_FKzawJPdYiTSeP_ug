They even have one that puts proceeds into WEMU's radio station, which is cute.  They have Frenchly pressed coffee, which is steamy delicious, and the pancakes are little fluffies of amazingness.  What's great about the diner is that you can order the lunch portion when you want.  If you're like me, you might want a salad with that heap of eggs and bacon to make you feel a tad bit better.\n\nI used to come here for breakfast and sit outside, drinking the free outside coffee (as Clarence mentioned), overlooking Ann Arbor across the bridge.  Once inside, I want to order the whole menu.\n\nMy boyfriend and I like to have discussions about the artwork that is on display.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ofjJxXNJEm1ORffWiORhZQ"}
