(and Magus doesn't have what I want)\n\nI love cats, even have a couple of my own, but the store smells like piss, which is unpleasant  for book browsing.  Also, these are not \"aren't you cute and I want to scratch your ears\" kinds of cats; they're crotchety and don't want you to touch them. \n\nI read. A lot.  I teach other people about reading and books for a living. I used to work in a used bookstore. And I think I'm pretty damn smart.  However, whenever I ask someone where a book is in the store, or if they know who wrote such and such book, I feel like an idiot.   I can feel the judgement oozing from behind the counter.  \n\nEnvironment is EVERYTHING in a bookstore, and this one sucks.  \n\nThey do have a pretty solid collection of used fiction at pretty decent prices.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4HM-xM5PgD8OszZRYYXmww"}
