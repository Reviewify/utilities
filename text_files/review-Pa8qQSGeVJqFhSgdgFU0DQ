(and magus doesn't have what i want) i love cats, even have a couple of my own, but the store smells like piss, which is unpleasant for book browsing. also, these are not \"aren't you cute and i want to scratch your ears\" kinds of cats; they're crotchety and don't want you to touch them. i read. a lot. i teach other people about reading and books for a living. i used to work in a used bookstore. and i think i'm pretty damn smart. however, whenever i ask someone where a book is in the store, or if they know who wrote such and such book, i feel like an idiot. i can feel the judgement oozing from behind the counter. environment is everything in a bookstore, and this one sucks. they do have a pretty solid collection of used fiction at pretty decent prices.", "business_id": "4HM-xM5PgD8OszZRYYXmww", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-17", "type": "review"}
