(and Magus doesn't have what I want) I love cats, even have a couple of my own, but the store smells like piss, which is unpleasant for book browsing. Also, these are not \"aren't you cute and I want to scratch your ears\" kinds of cats; they're crotchety and don't want you to touch them. I read. A lot. I teach other people about reading and books for a living. I used to work in a used bookstore. And I think I'm pretty damn smart. However, whenever I ask someone where a book is in the store, or if they know who wrote such and such book, I feel like an idiot. I can feel the judgement oozing from behind the counter. Environment is EVERYTHING in a bookstore, and this one sucks. They do have a pretty solid collection of used fiction at pretty decent prices.", "business_id": "4HM-xM5PgD8OszZRYYXmww", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-17", "type": "review"}
