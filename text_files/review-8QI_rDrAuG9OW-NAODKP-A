Very similar to pubs in Europe (with a name like London Underground, that makes sense).  Excellent beer selection, and excellent food - including prime rib on the last Friday of every month for just $9.  There's a nice review of the food from a foodie, Ron - http://ramblinron.com/2012/01/20/the-underground-pub-blacksburg-va/ And now the Pub is even better, as Easy Chair Coffee Shop has moved to the Pub and serves breakfast and coffee every morning until 10:30.  Great coffee, great breakfast ... the best keeps getting better. Oh yea, they have darts too, but I'm not allowed to play with sharp objects.", "business_id": "I_CFI8tpJHkGthEet3v3WA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-21", "type": "review"}
