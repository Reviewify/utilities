But I do have to admit it's better than your grocery store selection's bagels - a bit fluffier and softer. I came in with a BOGO lunch bagel special and got two \"Tasty Turkey\" bagels for 6.95. Not a bad deal and it was decent with the potato salad. As a chain store, you don't need to expect much. But considering the parking lot is not free, it's crowded in the parking lot, and the food is mediocre - I won't be coming back unless I get another deal.", "business_id": "9Adrvr8ycurboVNl7KcKyg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-01", "type": "review"}
