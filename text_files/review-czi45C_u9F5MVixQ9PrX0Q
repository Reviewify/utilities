The food was overpriced for the level of quality.  The restaurant was very loud, and my party was seated right next to the kitchen. To make matters worse, the lighting in place feels like stage spotlights.\n\nI miss the old downtown Champaign location.  The Urbana restaurant lacks the charm and coziness that the Great Impasta once had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pH72Y8aqqJlq3bgtj-d3UA"}
