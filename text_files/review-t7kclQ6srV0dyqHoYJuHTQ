As I come to the end of my undergraduate education at Pitt, I look back fondly on my dozens of late-night visits to India Garden. I have never been here other than during half-off. They have changed the hours for half-off a lot in the last few years, so here's the official update, as of September 2010: a selection of entrees that includes all vegetarian and most chicken dishes is half-off 5-6 pm and 9-11 pm.  Ordering from the half-off menu makes this place a bargain - I think I would consider it somewhat overpriced otherwise. The menu is vast and covers a wide range of different styles of Indian cooking, though focused on Northern Indian dishes like most Indian restaurants in the US. There are probably about 60 or more entrees, including about 20 or so vegetarian ones. You get a ton of food, as well - I almost never finish mine, and take it home for lunch the next day.  The only drawback to the food is the extremely inconsistent \"spiciness levels.\" The server typically asks for you to indicate your desired spiciness on a scale of 1-10. I usually order a 5 or 6 and have received everything from \"suitable for infants\" to \"ow ow my tongue.\" While the food is inconsistent, it is always good and I always enjoy it.  The inside of the restaurant is dark and is pretty loud at night, with the Bollywood music blaring. I have noticed that it has been quieter the last few times I've been there, though.  The service is sullen, sometimes slow, but otherwise perfectly adequate. Be polite and friendly to your server and you'll get politeness and friendliness back.", "business_id": "PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-27", "type": "review"}
