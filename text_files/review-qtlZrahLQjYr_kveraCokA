I have never waited more than five minutes for an order.  Also, parking is free at the Spire deck if you stay less than an hour.  Their meals are a great proportion and healthy.  Expect to pay $10 with a drink, more if you add the seared tuna to your salad.  My favorite dish is the Asian Salad with seared tofu.  Their lemonade and flavored iced tea are also \"must try.\"\n\nOH!  I also enjoy their chocolate selection.  They have premium brands from around the world, many with 70% cocoa content.  My favorite is a brand from Russia.  It's cocoa content is high, but it is still creamy in texture; something that a lot of bars lack.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AWsOwlorVHRSpgPJy1I0eg"}
