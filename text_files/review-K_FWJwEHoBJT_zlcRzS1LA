I came here with a few friends last week, and paid with my credit card. It was not until I got my statement from the bank I realized that BJ's had changed how much I wrote on my receipt, and gave themselves a $20 tip! Luckily, I took a picture of my original receipt and got my money back from the bank.  BJ's, this is credit card fraud. I will be calling corporate and police, and pressing charges! See you in court.", "business_id": "4ERMTfKvWdANjLdyjiCcDA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-18", "type": "review"}
