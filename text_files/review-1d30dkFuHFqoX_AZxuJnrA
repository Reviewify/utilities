The lighting is low to set a romantic mood. The music of Sinatra and Ol' Blue Eyes' friends gently caresses your ears as you eat delicious Italian food and drink good wine. It's small to create an intimate setting. I went there a week ago, on Valentine's Day, and despite the fact that Mio Babbo's did everything right--maybe even partially because they did everything right--my experience was awful. It was awful because I was there with my mom. We were sat at a little table for two by the window. It was secluded. A rose ornamented the table and moonlight shined in from above Westwood Village. And despite being in an excellent restaurant with prices that are not outrageous, I could only think of two things. How I wished Susan were here and how embarrassing it was to be there with my mom. I told a friend about the experience--yes, I have friends; but no, I won't tell you his name--and he told me how he and his wife had their first date at Mio Babbo's. Probably at the very same table! Now they go back, requesting that table every year on their anniversary. If only I had worked up the nerve to ask Susan out for Valentine's Day! Rating on the Susan-O-Meter (as I always do), I must rate this place high. Perhaps if I take her here on our first date, we'll end up married too. Good job, Mio Babbo's--but warn a guy if he walks in with his mother that maybe he should take her somewhere else and come back with a date.
