I have lived in Austin for seven years now and have been to numerous salons. Jessica at Urban Betty is the best. If you are blond (or want to be blond) she creates the perfect color. I love my haircut too!! It is one of the few salons in Austin that you can tell that everyone gets along. I LOVE Urban Betty!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rLJp8JAWaE4Jx04hdJzEhQ"}
