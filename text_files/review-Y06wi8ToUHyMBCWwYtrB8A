What more can you ask from a fast food place?\n\nI signed up for their e-club two weeks ago and received an email coupon for a free meal. I went in tonight to redeem it and the employee was so nice about it. I was a little surprised.\n\nThen the manager offered me an extra bag for limes to take home.\n\nI will definitely be returning. There was service with a smile, the food came out quickly, and everything was pretty tasty.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jMhmL_bdHJmd4GGlF0IBgA"}
