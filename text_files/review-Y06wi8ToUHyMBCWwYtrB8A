What more can you ask from a fast food place? I signed up for their e-club two weeks ago and received an email coupon for a free meal. I went in tonight to redeem it and the employee was so nice about it. I was a little surprised. Then the manager offered me an extra bag for limes to take home. I will definitely be returning. There was service with a smile, the food came out quickly, and everything was pretty tasty.", "business_id": "jMhmL_bdHJmd4GGlF0IBgA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-28", "type": "review"}
