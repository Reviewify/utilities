You can't tell by the way it looks, and the long line just might indicate that college students can't afford to eat anything else, but that's not the case.\n\nLarge portions, and really good tasting pasta. I've had like 4 different dishes, and they were all really good. Add to that the low price of about $6 - $8 for a plate, (which beats paying $17 - $19 at some trendy little Italian place), and it makes this place a winner", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ"}
