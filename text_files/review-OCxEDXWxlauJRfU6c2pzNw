Usually I'd write a review right away, but I wanted to make sure that I made an accurate review on this location so everyone really knew how well this business is =) The reviews are correct. There are only 4 workers at this location. If you want to come, maybe make an appointment or go on a day where there usually isn't too many people like a week day. Today just happened to be a day that was not busy so I had alot of attention from the ladies.  Vivian usually does my pedicures. But today, I had the pleasure of working with the other two ladies. I don't know what the complaint is. They are all really good. I always where my ipod and play music. I close my eyes so they know I want to relax and they don't talk to me. If you want to talk, then talk. And to be quite honest, on their LESS busy days, they take MORE time on you because they aren't rushed to be with the next customer.  The place is very clean. Chairs are awesome with massagers that feel extremely nice. There are no tv's which for me is nice because I feel like they are distracting anyways. DO NOT PARK IN THE METERS!! Its only an hour max. Park behind the ROSS or the next block over where the corner bakery/Macy's is. I live around the area so I just walk down the street.  The girls are always so friendly and its about $30 for mani/pedi. I think for a pedicure alone its $17? I might be wrong so don't quote me. But for the location and for the quality I think this place is awesome!!!", "business_id": "IXT-6hjM4elugdKDNTUVjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-22", "type": "review"}
