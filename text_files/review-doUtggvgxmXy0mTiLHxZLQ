While they still sell bubble tea, they've changed the layout of their shop quite a few times within the past year. The last time I wrote my review, I noted that they started selling clothes. Now they've taken down those items and are now offering meals, such as bento lunches and burgers. \n\nPerhaps they're trying to branch out their investments, but as a result I find that their gifts selection now leaves something to be desired.\n\nC'mon, Momoko! Figure out what it is you're trying to cater to your customers before you start confusing them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iNVDkapV60vH3KIS7kYDDA"}
