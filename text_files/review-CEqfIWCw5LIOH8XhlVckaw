I was expecting a pretty standard university gym, but the IMA is pretty well equipped. Given the size of the place, it takes a while to figure out what's where. As you come in, you'll see a bunch of cardio-type machines on your left, and the running track upstairs. In the basement is a giant weight room with plenty of dumbbells, machines and so on, as well as multiple squat racks and Olympic platforms. They also have various oddly-shaped contraptions on which one can do pull-ups and dips with weird grips, though I didn't see a simple, regular pull-up bar anywhere except on the power racks. Also, some kettlebells would have been nice.\n\nThe website (above) has a longer, but still incomplete list of the facilities: swimming pool, sports fields etc. They even have a pretty nice set of judo mats.\n\nThe only downside is the hours; it closes at a sane time, so no late-night workouts here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7XyhkkFGSzFNMe6uppsyHQ"}
