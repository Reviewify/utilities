Drinks ordered did not show up. Of course $3 for a non-refill half size coke bottle delivered with a glass, on the 3rd try does not breed happiness.......\n$152 total for 4 entrees, 4 appetizers and 4 sodas.....\n\n\nThis is the 2nd Italian in sequence at this location, and it may survive but I am doubtful.........", "type": "review", "business_id": "J9xVQScnr0lYWl61_mLXMA"}
