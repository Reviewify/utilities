My reuben was very good sized for $6 and came with ample fries. THe boy's grilled cheese and buffalo wings were also good according to him. The iced tea was real brewed and didn't even need sweetner, it was fairly strong bodied tea. It took a little long for a work day lunch, but would probably be great for a lazy weekend afternoon. The service was a bit too brusk and disjointed. Also it was slightly dirty.", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-08", "type": "review"}
