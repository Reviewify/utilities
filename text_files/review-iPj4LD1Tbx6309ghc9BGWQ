Decadence would be the word I use to describe this institution. We shared a calamari and fried shrimp appetizer as well as the creamiest potato soup I have ever had. I also had scallops with a super rich (and delicious) rissotto. For desert, we shared a chocolate pot de creme, O.M.G. For someone who doesn't really like chocolate, this was amazing. My friend had a fruit cup with raspberry sorbet. This did not sound intruiging to me, until I saw it. Capital WOW Squared! They need to do this desert justice by bringing out a tray of offerings. Complete with star fruit, kiwi, mango and a variety of other \"exotic\" fruits, it was served in a freshly made shell and was amazingly delicious. (See pics posted). The only thing I didn't like was the decor, It is a little on the cheesy 1990 art nuovo side, could use a little update.", "business_id": "-_FvwOM3_wku2zHiLjibgg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-29", "type": "review"}
