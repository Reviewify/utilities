Not too big, not too small.  The decor was simple.  I liked the gold couches and big projection screen behind the bar that was framed like a painting.  But there should be some seating other than VIP, which requires bottle service.\n\nThe crowd was mainly black, but I think there was a party going on there because my friend invited me.  I get the feeling that the crowd is mixed sometimes/varies, as is the case with most clubs.\n\nA burlesque dancer did a tasteful show (it was some guy's birthday). \n\nThe only thing that bothers me about clubs/lounges, in general, is that the men and women are often separated like a seventh-grade party.  It was no exception here.  \n\nI get the impression that this is one of those places where you can't go alone on a whim and meet people.  We came in a group of five women and one man and we had a good time.\n\nThe bartenders were on top of things and friendly ($10 for Grey Goose and water with lime might be a bit much for Atlanta, though).  There was no excessive waiting for drinks.  \n\nOur name was on a list and they kept things moving without being jerks at the door.  Again, no excessive waiting and there was no cover charge because we got there early.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XSpYRjl8T8TRQKu3Wu-iCA"}
