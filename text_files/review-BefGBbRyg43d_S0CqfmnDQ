The decor was simple. I liked the gold couches and big projection screen behind the bar that was framed like a painting. But there should be some seating other than VIP, which requires bottle service. The crowd was mainly black, but I think there was a party going on there because my friend invited me. I get the feeling that the crowd is mixed sometimes/varies, as is the case with most clubs. A burlesque dancer did a tasteful show (it was some guy's birthday). The only thing that bothers me about clubs/lounges, in general, is that the men and women are often separated like a seventh-grade party. It was no exception here. I get the impression that this is one of those places where you can't go alone on a whim and meet people. We came in a group of five women and one man and we had a good time. The bartenders were on top of things and friendly ($10 for Grey Goose and water with lime might be a bit much for Atlanta, though). There was no excessive waiting for drinks. Our name was on a list and they kept things moving without being jerks at the door. Again, no excessive waiting and there was no cover charge because we got there early.", "business_id": "XSpYRjl8T8TRQKu3Wu-iCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-03", "type": "review"}
