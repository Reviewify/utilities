I wouldn't have known Jorie and LPR existed otherwise...  I've been growing out my eyebrows for quite awhile some awful wax and threading experiences. After all the glowing reviews, I decided to trust Jorie and let her reshape the unslightly mass of hair above my eyes.  After a little miscommunication about our appointment (make sure she responds with a confirmation), she sat me down and went to work. What I really love is that she explains what she's about to do and why. She also only uses tweezers!! Is it painful? As painful as pulling out individual hairs can be, but she's super quick and precise about it. After plucking and trimming to perfection, she also fills in your brows so you're all made up as you leave the salon and face the public.  I left completely satisfied with my brows after my first appointment with Jorie - and I can't wait to schedule my next one! (yes, I'm a nerd)", "business_id": "zWMKtesdqm82vL8yOOytvQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-05", "type": "review"}
