We had a great meal both times. It is a deli - we were not expecting gourmet. They have great ice tea (you brew it at the table and pour it into a tall glass of ice) I had corned beef sandwiches both times. Nice and moist. Last time, my husband had a wrap, and it looked fresh and well made. My son was with us the most recent time, and his ham/cheese sandwich looked great. He also got the fries/onion rings, which we all enjoyed.  I thought service was excellent. I also liked how after my son downed his milk, the waiter offered him another one - on the house.", "business_id": "olrFYjKobULoH4-ZucnpTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-06", "type": "review"}
