We arrived on a Saturday at 2.30pm (the buffet is served from Noon until 3.30pm).  The place itself is pretty run-down and uninviting, but we were starving.  We go in and grab 2 of the remaining 4 plates and view the buffet - had we not been starving and just gone through the pain of finding somewhere to park in Ann Arbor, we would simply have left. There was very little that even looked appetizing.  There were several empty containers showing ugly looking remnants of what had been there earlier (I will post pics if I can) and VERY little with any meat in it.  There was some nasty looking small fried fish that smelt fit for the dumpster, there was some \"chilly chicken\" that despite the name was hot but was actually deep fried in batter (like in a very bad chinese) so that what you got was \"chilly batter\" where some chicken might be found in about 10% of those nasty little suckers.  Then there was some goat curry.  Now sorry goat is not for me.  The naan bread had been sitting on heat trays so long it was dry and crunchy.  There was a guy kept waiting for 5 minutes just to get a plate.  NASTY NASTY place.\n\nI went to pay and the manager asked me how it was, I told him I would never return plus much of the above and I also asked where was the boneless lamb they proudly announce on the yelp page.  He replied that it was the weekend, and they don't serve lamb on weekends - below then I have posted the quote from the yelp page \"boneless lamb everyday\"  - I think \"bulls@#t everyday\" is more accurate.  AVOID at all costs and never never go there hungry. Why can't I give 0 stars??\n\n\"We don't cut corners..Boneless Lamb everyday in the Buffet...Vegan or Vegetarian..No Problem.. Come in \"", "type": "review", "business_id": "K3EBuyhTBTAhR2-ImlrtJg"}
