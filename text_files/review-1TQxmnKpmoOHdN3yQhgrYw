I'd seen Anthropologie before, and I thought the artistic displays were great, but I thought the clothing was a little too much on the bohemian side to blend well with my style... I guess I didn't look hard enough until recently.\n\nThese days, I've learned how to pick through their merchandise and find special treasures. What really keeps me coming back is the uniqueness of the designs. The details. The whimsical and feminine pieces that garner me so many compliments. In retrospect, I guess I had to broaden my sense of style a little.\n\nOne of the challenges of being an Anthro fan is getting to the new stuff before it's sold out in your size. They only get a few pieces in each style, and once they're gone, they're gone. It would pay to develop a good relationship with a salesgirl, but that's next to impossible at this location because they're just not interested.\n\nIf they would develop a \"personal shopper\" program, it's a sure bet that this store would get an even bigger share of my wallet than they already do, but either way, I'll keep showing up and searching for those little treasures.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RRRByyMGlN1FLXjj4NXMlQ"}
