I've been working in Kendall Sq. for years, going out to lunch every day, so the opening of anything new is like a giant reset button for my lunch habits. The Friendly Toast might just wipe out all competition, though. We split a giant (and I do mean giant) plate of Guinness-battered onion rings with some kind of creamy caper sauce. Perfection! The batter had both corn meal and corn flakes for perfect crunch and sweetness. For lunch I got the DGGC (damn good grilled cheese) which came with DGSHS (damn good strawberry habanero sauce). Hot sex on a platter. I'll be back, so I'll def. be updating the review, but right now? The easiest five stars I've ever handed out. I'm sure it'll only get better with time. UPDATE: Well I've been a few times, and until they fix the service issues I'm bumping the Toast down to three stars. Great good but it takes too fuckin' long for the spaced-out staff to notice that you need a refill, a check, or to have an order taken.", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-18", "type": "review"}
