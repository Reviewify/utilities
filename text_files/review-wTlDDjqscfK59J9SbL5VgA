We both ordered the business lunch for 13.99. This comes with your choice of soup or salad, your pick of 2 tapas and dessert. I got the soup, which was chicken soup w/ white beans, Mmmm. My 2 tapas were chicken 'kabob' that was several chunks of chicken breast/onion/green pepper on a bed of saffron rice and the goat cheese & tomato bake. Both were good. I spread the goat cheese over the grilled vegtables (& everything else!) that also came with the lunch. Dessert was your choice of flan, chocolate torte or tres leches. My friend and I were both satified with the food & service. My drink was kept full and the plates cleaned away as I finished them. Can't wait to take hubby there!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fla_8ZJSGo6RlXLYw8YB9A"}
