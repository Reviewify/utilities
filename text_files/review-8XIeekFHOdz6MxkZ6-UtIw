Still though they have REALLY good prices for cookies and ice cream sandwiches at like less than $2 a piece? SIGN ME UP! Service is great and the girl behind the counter was really friendly and explained to me what their cookies like snickerdoodle and turtle (or something similar) were. Snickerdoodle by the way is AWESOME I even bought extra cookies cuz they were so bomb! Definitely will be going back whenever I'm in Berkeley and have a sweet tooth or after a workout haha.", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-10", "type": "review"}
