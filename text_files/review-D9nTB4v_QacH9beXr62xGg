The place is so nice, I ended up staying for about 2 hours...I got a ton of work done, and had the most delicious chicken tortilla soup I have had in a long time (that is saying a lot, seeing as how I eat chicken tortilla soup at every opportunity).  They don't charge for the wireless, but they do charge $1 for every hour you plug your computer into their outlets. I will definitely come back next time I find myself in the neighborhood.", "business_id": "EEH6_Akx74HuYBcAfSozSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-06", "type": "review"}
