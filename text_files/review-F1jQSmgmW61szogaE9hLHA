They make it way too sweet. I happen to like the boba balls here, but I rarely get them because they'll make me fat. :P I prefer Volcano Tea boba drinks over Boba Loca, but they make up for it with the studying environment. I like studying here because they have nice bright light and it is a little quieter than the Starbucks across the street. The benches are so comfortable and there is free Wi-Fi (so screw you Starbucks). They are also open pretty late.  Oh, I think they hire pretty cute people. I need to include one of my experiences here. It was so badass! A homeless man came into Boba Loca at around 11pm and he was making a lot of noise. The buff Asian guy who worked here got out a big stick and threatened the homeless man with it. I swore they were going to get in a big brawl (I was prepared; I got out my pepper spray haha). Things settled down and the man left, but it was pretty intense.", "business_id": "fmM-FUmWXrPcCI1HJu32WA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-05", "type": "review"}
