The service was great - very attentive in filling up my soda and friendly at the cash register. There is a lot of variety, especially in the asian food category. For variety and the seafood offering, it was a good deal. Come at 11am, when they open, when everything is hot and untouched. The seafood was good. They had a huge fillet of salmon in butter sauce, which was ok. Shrimp and crab legs with cocktail sauce. My favorite dish was the cooked shrimp. Sushi was really bad. Dim sum (two varieties) was eh. There were a lot of salads - seaweed salad, sprouts salad, a lot of asian salads. I was not a huge fan, but I think this is more of a matter of personal taste. Fried foods: veggie tempura, egg rolls, fried fish...the list goes on. Meat: short ribs, BBQ ribs, pork chops, meatballs, some types of chicken. Best bet: boneless pork chops. They also had 1-2 soups, which I didn't try. They have a meager green salad bar, and fresh fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries) and canned fruit (pears, peaches). Dessert: I didn't see ice cream. They had little pastry type desserts and - get this - oreo cookies. Dessert is not their forte. I would come back if I was really hungry - I was full for the rest of the day. Being inside is a bit surreal compared to other Berkeley restaurants: the clientele is essentially late 20s-early 30s working folks (I saw some guys in dress shirts), and the lack of students is odd. The inside is much nicer than the outside. Cons: the music was wwaaayyy too loud. I couldn't even talk to my lunch companion over it.", "business_id": "4z3bGvWjCc2716z2y9sroQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-05-08", "type": "review"}
