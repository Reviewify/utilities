Admittedly, there is a large selection of rolls, sushi, and Korean dishes, but they were not the best.   I went there during the summer once, sat outside because it was a cool summer evening, and found flies in two of the soy sauce bottles.  Luckily we could see it before anyone touched it, and we were disgusted.  Needless to say, our appetites diminished quickly.\n\nService also takes quite a long time here -- I usually wait around 30 minutes for my food, even if I order it for pick-up.  They delivered to the library once, when I was studying during finals with my friends in one of the study rooms here, and the order took over an hour and a half to arrive.  The food was cold and lukewarm by the time it came, and we were again, disappointed.\n\nOne time, I didn't receive my food while five of my other friends had received theirs.  By the time they were half done, I figured mine wasn't coming out, and I asked the waitress what was going on.  Basically, they blamed me for not reminding them and for complaining to them during a busy time.  If my friends received their food, and I ordered at the same time as them, I'm sure that it isn't complaining when I don't receive my food.  Especially when I spoke as politely as I could to the manager, and was pretty much brushed over.\n\nI haven't been back since -- maybe I'll go again next year when I'm not as bitter.\n\nI give two stars because sometimes, the food tastes pretty decent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ"}
