I'm a Fan.\" status.\n\nThey have pretty good food here, and of all the chain Fish Taco places, I like theirs the bestest (though I would like to frequent Wahoo's a bit more to tell if they live up to the hype but they are not located in any place I ever want to actually go).  The rest of the menu is good too.  \n\nService is fast for the fact that they really do spend time with each order.  Not always the most upbeat behind the counter, but neither is my favorite El Zarape and I go back there all the time (note:  El Z is far superior in food, there is NO comparison there).\n\nOverall pretty decent little place that blows the doors off of Rubio's across the street and Chipoooootle's around the corner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T8sFo4cijoGTDfKg8tA_9Q"}
