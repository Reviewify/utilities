I actually prefer Logan slightly because of the service and I like the desserts better (I can only get those pots of chocolate so many times at Eve). Logan hooked me early on by serving me my first Osso Bucco, and while they no longer have that on the menu, the other rotating offerings are equally as sublime. Really no other place in Ann Arbor comes close to the subtle and exquisite food that Logan offers, plus they email you great coupons once a month if you sign up for their club. I miss Logan!", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0C8R0VWh_6HEzpLhKocGA"}
