The waiter seemed humored by me and my date's indecisiveness, but he wasn't much in the way of help when it came to suggesting dishes.\n\nWe both ended up getting the duck, which I'd never had before, so I can't be an accurate judge of how good it was. But I had to laugh when the waiter described it to a nearby patron as \"not too tender.\" It was definitely tender, if not too much so.\n\nThe atmosphere here is really nice, but overall I think this place is trying to be more upscale than it really is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2wu_RvBn3QYANniI6oD4pA"}
