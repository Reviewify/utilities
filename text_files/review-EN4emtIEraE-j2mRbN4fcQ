She pretty much summed up our experience.  I like the decor and the waiters were nice (one was training...first day on the job).  \n\nWe were there for about an hour and a half.  I honestly think they forgot our order.  What bugs me is that, if you did, just admit it, instead of continuously saying \"it'll be out in a minute.\"\n\nThe food wasn't hot at all.  The sweet potato pancakes were quite mushy.  The fish and grits were good, but again, the food was cold.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4rWJGwb3rjDoZHA0AECa5A"}
