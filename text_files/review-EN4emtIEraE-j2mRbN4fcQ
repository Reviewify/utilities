She pretty much summed up our experience.  I like the decor and the waiters were nice (one was training...first day on the job).   We were there for about an hour and a half.  I honestly think they forgot our order.  What bugs me is that, if you did, just admit it, instead of continuously saying \"it'll be out in a minute.\" The food wasn't hot at all.  The sweet potato pancakes were quite mushy.  The fish and grits were good, but again, the food was cold.", "business_id": "4rWJGwb3rjDoZHA0AECa5A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-24", "type": "review"}
