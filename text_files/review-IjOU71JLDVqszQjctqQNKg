If sixth graders think this place is cool, then it must be doing something right!\n\nAnyway, multiple floors with numerous rooms and exhibits makes for a fun-filled visit. You have your typical museum exhibits, such as the dinosaurs fossils and life-size skeletons meticulously arranged to showcase their scale and your displays of some of North America's (and Africa's) most popular wildlife. Some more interesting (and unique) exhibits include a vast gem and mineral collection (bling! bling!), the Ralph M. Parsons Discovery Center (where kids can view live specimens of reptiles and insects, feel real animal skins and furs, use interactive displays, and participate in many hands-on activities), and a hall dedicated to California's rich history (sans Huell Howser).\n\nDespite being extremely educational and informative, visits here will always be enjoyable and (for kids) usually filled with a couple of \"oohs and ahhs\" along the way. It's pretty interesting for us adults, too. Don't forget to stop by the gift shop for a keepsake. Oh, and don't forget to say 'hi' to the Coelocanth on the first level...he's a 'looker!'", "type": "review", "business_id": "v4XQSiFL9QblKnLE4pJz6A"}
