While it shares a kitchen (I think) with it's neighbor Daily Bread the latin flavors are right on the mark for this south of the border dining experience. Friendly service!\n\nThe tamarind and jalapeno wings are divine. Flavorful with kick - not a punch. The app portion is a nice meal for one (with a side salad) or to share.\n\nThe house salad includes raddishes, nicely cubed tomatoes and an yummy avocado vinaigrette.\n\nWorth going back to try the chicken mole burrito and chicken chili relleno. Have also heard great things about the beet salad - sadly they were out of the relleno and beets the day I was there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIQzijmM4GEYTFfZWkgADQ"}
