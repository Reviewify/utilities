Coming from someone who has lived in both California and Texas, it is safe to say that I know authentic Mexican food pretty well and it was immediately obvious to me that this \"restaurant\" is hardly more authentic than Taco Bell. The food was poorly made, looked unappetizing, and had the flavor to match. To top things off, our waitress did not say more than 5 words to us through the entire meal. She never came by to ask for refills, see how we were doing, or bring us silverware...which should have been on the table in the first place. In a nutshell, this is a poor excuse for a restaurant and if you are used to authentic Mexican food, don't bother coming here.", "business_id": "ozEhcaxRvH9NtwbBoUatPQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-17", "type": "review"}
