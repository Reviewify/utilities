I guess they mean you have to go elsewhere in the neighborhood for quality food. As someone else here said, it's a step above Cici's, which is why it costs $2 more. What I DON'T get about the other reviews here is how disappointed people are. It's $7 in BERKELEY. How could it possibly be good? They have goofy pizzas such as one with feta cheese and sun dried tomatoes and another one with spinach. It's either fancy low-end or cheap-ass high end.  They have about a dozen pepsi products in the fountain including a no-calorie green tea with artificial peach flavor that was pretty good.  This place is an excellent source of high fructose corn syrup. For a lot of people that's very exciting. So be it. (Hmm, they also have Sobe in the fountain, but just the diet cranberry grapefruit one.) But go to their website. Check out the dude. Look how high he is. Your expectations should be met with this place, or else you are bad at setting expectations. The chairs closest to the large TV are perpendicular to it, rather than facing it. This seems stupid. I'll be back, because I have a garbage can for a stomach.", "business_id": "qB_Vt4AUbDX6r6qhS6gJ8g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-08", "type": "review"}
