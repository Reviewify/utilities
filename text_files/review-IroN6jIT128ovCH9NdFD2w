Terra Burger!\"\n\nI ordered the veggie burger and sweet potato fries. The nice girl asked if I wanted a drink and I didn't; I had my SIGG in the car. Then she informed me that the combo meal was like $2 cheaper than a burger and fries. So as it turned out, I DID want a drink!\n\nNo Dr. Pepper  or Diet Coke here, kids! Just good ol' all natural soda. She recommended the black cherry and it was awesome.\n\nI ate my lunch at my desk back at work, (I KNOW, Michael Pollan, I KNOW) and I wished I had hot sauce to go with my ketchup/mayo for the sweet potatoes (yes, I'm a mayo-fry-dipper) and I found the burger a bit bland. But THEN that night I heard a report on NPR about how Americans consume too much salt so I think Terra Burger might be onto something.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UopVUJ32ASCt-ek3guCmwQ"}
