Friendly to serious comics fans and newcomers alike -- you don't have to be a giant comics nerd to feel welcomed here (and I say that with all love for giant comics nerds). Especially as a woman, I love that I can go in there without being stared at, leered at, or lectured to. Big points for female-friendliness. And you know That Comics Store Guy? The one who hangs out for hours, annoying the people working there and customers by insisting on chatting to them? I've never seen That Guy at Chapel Hill Comics. They sell classic graphic novels, superhero books, non-superhero books, indie books, manga, and even some more art-book stuff. Fantastic selection. The people who work there are knowledgeable as well as being friendly. If you're looking for something new, they'll talk with you about what you like, and recommend something for you. I've heard about some great stuff that way. Even though I don't live in Chapel Hill, I make the trip to Chapel Hill Comics because it's just far and away the best.", "business_id": "b7lMDnk5k84aEBQP_joWnQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-14", "type": "review"}
