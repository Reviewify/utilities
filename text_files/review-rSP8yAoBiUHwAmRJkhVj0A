I think this place might fare a lot better for a week-night meet-up than it does on weekends, when it's just confusing -- too loud to converse, too awk to dance; not laidback enough to just chill, but not quite a club. If you want a lounge-y atmosphere with a similar slightly upscale atmosphere, my call would be to go one T stop over one way to Noir in Harvard Square, or two the other to Alibi by Charles. But if you're really into standing in lines in the cold on weekend nights, this is it, folks!", "business_id": "G4K5wXUe3aZ387yS1Gju7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-11", "type": "review"}
