The chick that helped us just wanted to go home it was apparent. It was less then 30 mins til they closed but our first visit to Cinnaholic. She didnt explain how to order, prices anything. I just picked Mocha Almond since it was displayed in the case and my daughter went original. And we both ordered a hot chocolate. Total was $15 something!!!! Say what?!?!? I asked her how much? She repeated the total and paid the woman and sat down. A few girls came in later and the other chick assisted them and explained all kinds of information including recommendations, pricing, and a card that apparently after so many purchases you get a free roll. Hello! What am i invisible. Was that an un-vitation to return.Don't get me wrong the cinnamon rolls were tasty but the service WE got wasnt so great. And i already left a tip in their jar when i ordered. But then again I always tip. Always when its bad food, bad service I cannot not tip. Wouldi go back, probably not. I seen other cafes in the area and like to try new places but at least now I know what I should have ordered and know how much to expect to pay. I donot think they had price listings. Cross your fingers for the chick with tattoos she was nice and helpful we got the Other One.", "business_id": "2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-05", "type": "review"}
