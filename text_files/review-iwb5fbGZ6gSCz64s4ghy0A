The feel of the La Jolla Peets is much more earthy and real than the Starbucks in the Ralph's shopping center across the street.  Both places are crowded, but I like the people at Peets more.   The regulars are all very friendly.  Today I had the elderly man next door explain to me what a \"steeplechase\" was.  Then he proceeded to chat it up with his MIT-alum friend who works for the biotechs on North Torrey Pines Street, and then chatted it up more with the Berkeley-alums sitting right in front of me. Ah.  The coffee is really good too.  Strong and flavorful, you really appreciate the coffee taste for what its supposed to taste like.  I usually end up getting their Caffe Freddo, which has bits of coffee beans ground up into the blended coffee/ice.  It's yummy.  I've tried their mochas too, but I always end up getting my favorite Cafffe Freddo.   Cons?  Super crowded and super noisy at this Peets.  If you want to study, you'd better wear your earplugs.  If you like the background noise and want a place to people watch, read the paper or read a travel book, then this is the place for you.", "business_id": "xrUeDwQs35JbV-ZDfCbYnA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-27", "type": "review"}
