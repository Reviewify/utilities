We were seated at a small table in the front of the dining room, next to the entryway. At that time the customers would wait outside until they were seated but due to the rain the customers piled in a very small area adjacent to my chair. I could not lift my left arm without bumping into the person standing beside me. \n\nThe noise level was overwhelming to the point that I could not carry on a conversation with my friend. \n\nThe service was mediocre, we had to ask for an iced tea refill. When I complained about the crowding around my table, his response was \"I'll see what I can do\". He didn't even offer an apology. \n\nThen there was the meal. We both ordered the same items - a salad, iced tea and the least expensive choice on the menu. Our bill was $65.00 and we both felt unsatisfied, the portions were child size. The pasta dish with caramelized onions was tasteless. The salad was the highlight of our experience.\n\nI would normally return to give a second chance, however. since the entire experience was unsatisfactory, I will not return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vg55SAkrEmuHpWfIMtJjBQ"}
