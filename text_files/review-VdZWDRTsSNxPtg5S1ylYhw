Reading other comments on Yelp made me skeptical on buying from this company but I couldn't find this swim top anywhere else so I took the risk in buying it. I bought the swim top on Tuesday and it was already on my doorstep by Wednesday. It was the correct size and product I ordered. I am in love with the top. It's a beautiful red color, appears a lighter red in the picture displayed on the site, but we all know that pictures aren't true to color. Buying the product was definitely worth it. As far as future purchases with this company, I would most likely give in to buying more products again.", "business_id": "4z4IdKvuhDd-AZKPkxKBrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-03", "type": "review"}
