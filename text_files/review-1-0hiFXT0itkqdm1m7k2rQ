I love their sandwiches, and they have whatever dairy free, gluten free little bits of heaven you desire.  The baristas are so nice, except for this one dude, but I think I am going to give him another chance, it being a leap year and all. \n\nAlso, you can walk right in to Toy Joy and shop around while you wait...I love Toy Joy and the last time I went in there I was 75 dollars the poorer when I walked out.  That place is like the dang bermuda triangle!\n\nI stare in wonder at the nature printed laminate counters and wonder where I could find such a product.  Then I realize I don't own a counter...maybe someday.  Parking can be tricky, but where isn't parking tricky anymore?", "type": "review", "business_id": "jMALC3AdVtg6duBB-X7ZYw"}
