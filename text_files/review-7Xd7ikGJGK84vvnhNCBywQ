It seems that the restaurant was overwhelmed with customers; they had to open up another part of the restaurant when my party of 4 arrived and service was spotty.  The chips were greasy and I've had better salsa.  My chicken taco never arrived.  My cheese enchiladas were fine, but not fabulous.  The real tragedy was that my friend's burrito was cold, almost frozen, in some parts.  Inexcusable.  The waitress offered to reheat her burrito, but at that point she no longer found it appetizing.", "business_id": "YKAwpTnKO-n5vB9-pqaCLQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}
