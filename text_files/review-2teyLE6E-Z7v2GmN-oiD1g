The place has a great crowd of regulars and a foul mouthed bartender, name Mel working on Tuesday's and all they do is crack dirty jokes. But that isn't what almost killed me. It's Mel's propensity for making her drinks extra extra strong, and peep this wild special. 7-10pm / 24 taps/ $10 All You Can Drink. After taking advantage of this special and getting one of Mel's Rum and Coke's I tell you I could have walked through Time's Square naked.  They seem to have other specials on different nights and free live music in the basement on Friday's. I highly recommend you stop by here one night, and get into a very happy place.", "business_id": "gm9YBzKqckTX-3U6jNpQPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-17", "type": "review"}
