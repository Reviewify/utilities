Today, I bought pencils, an article of clothing, and a cookbook..(in case you were wondering.) The cookbook selection is comparable to that of any major book retailer! Despite the fact that there were at least 32.4 billion (roughly) students in here, (some wearing obnoxious, cheap perfume/cologne :\\ ), I was only in the checkout line for about 20 minutes!..(which is good considering it was the first day back, and there were freshmen with their parents in tow as well.)    Upstairs, you'll find more USC paraphernalia than you will ever need. I've bought sweaters and a few t-shirts here before, but a $950 gold USC umbrella stand? I could buy a laptop for $950, feed a homeless family for at least a month, OR buy a plane ticket to somewhere where it isn't raining. C'mon guys. Buy your necessities here, not overpriced and underused home decor. Oy.    And finally, I think people were particularly gassy today, because it smelled funny throughout the entire building. I even heard other people talking about it as well. One girl was wearing one of those fake-ass Louis Vuitton sars masks, but I don't know if it was because of the borderline noxious fumes or not. Umm, this review is really going down hill, so I'll stop. =p", "business_id": "Tc4eLpzyFjbmmcLN3oUEGw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-28", "type": "review"}
