But I love Kerbey Lane's pumpkin pancakes the most out of all the pancakes in the world! It's kind of sad, but I'm only an active customer of Kerbey Lane when pumpkin pancakes are in season--which is around October to December, I think. The pumpkin pancakes are just THAT amazing. My boyfriend and I will order other stuff like the Kerbey queso and maybe a salad, but we always have to order pumpkin pancakes! I once tried their pumpkin french toast with the expectation that it was on par with the pancakes; it was disappointingly dry. Thus, forever shall I stick with the pancakes. Other than that, I have no reason to go because it can get a little expensive, but Kerbey Lane certainly knows how to make an amazing stack of pancakes. See you again in the fall!", "business_id": "fsqtrHKBUeucacxeX9FPaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-14", "type": "review"}
