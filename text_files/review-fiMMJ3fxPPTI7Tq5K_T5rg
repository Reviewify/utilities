Living in South Bay and never having any business to be in East Bay, let alone Berkeley, I am not afforded that many opportunities to sample Top Dog.  But when I do, I'd like to make the most of it.  By buying a bunch of them at once.  Now granted, I have not done it for good eight months if not more - blame it on insane work schedule and rising gas prices.   However, should I ever venture up to Berkeley again, Top Dog would be my destination of choice.  There's nothing better than a grilled Louisiana Hot Link with lots of Sambel Cap Jempol (Indonesian hot sauce) - Bro, a Top Dog fanatic, missed it so much that he requested that I brought a couple of packets of these babies last time I went to visit him.  However, taking into account the 21-hour plane ride and multiple stops, his request was respectfully declined.
