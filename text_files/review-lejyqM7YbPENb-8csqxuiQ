I really like the bagels so I would give them a 4 (or even a 5 if using the rest of Seattle bagels as a comparison). But the service...more like a 3. Or a 2.5 depending on the day. They now accept credit cards although I actually liked that they were a holdout. Now it's just Aladdin's that won't take your card. Pretty soon there will be no need for cash at all...except wait, then how will be pay for hookers and blow? Just sayin'...think about it. But I digress. This is basically a fast, cheap place to get a bagel and some caffeine before bolting off to class or a meeting at UW. Not worth it's own trip but definitely convenient for us locals.", "business_id": "DtAGQu3EljPJbyASaJ2SpA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}
