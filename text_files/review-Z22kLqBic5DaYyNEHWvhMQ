The food was decent (had the ribeye steak with baked heirloom tomato and some appetizers, including the calamari and the melon with proscuito), but the part that killed the entire experience for me and my friends was the service.  Specifically, the place seems to now be staffed by a group of younger college-aged students who all could use some training in being a more professional waiter.  Our waiter was a bit aggressive and lacked the grace that you'd more typically expect in a nice Italian restaurant.  When filling our water glasses, he splashed water out of the glass and in one instance got some water into the pasta entre that a friend of mine was eating.  This happened more than once.  On another occasion, the waiter threw down our appetizers and entrees, again, lacking the grace that you'd expect to get.  I've previously eaten at Piatti's in the past, and it looks like things have changed (new logo, new menus, etc.).  I hope that they clean up the service aspect; otherwise I might think twice about coming here again, even though the food was decent (and yes, the bread here is great).", "business_id": "UR4o1izRUVX5WanCXW8S7A", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-09-17", "type": "review"}
