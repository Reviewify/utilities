Despite being located on the corner of Westwood and Le Conte where so many people pass by, there is surprisingly little people there. With its dark exterior, it's not exactly noticeable that the old business that closed there finally changed into Lucia's. \n\nThe ambiance inside is odd. An attempt at a hip environment for classic Italian with the decor and music. And crime show TV and the news. They serve peanuts instead of bread. Maybe it's because peanuts is cheaper? \n\nI have had ordered their desserts before, but this was my first visit to the restaurant, which was only because I wanted dessert. Food was meh, so meh that I didn't want dessert anymore. I felt like I was eating at a dining hall. Chicken Parmesan. Overly bland with dried up bits of chicken. My friend had the Spaghetti Bolognese. Dining hall quality.\n\nService was meh. We were the only people in the restaurant for a good half hour. The server swapped our order and I was confused as to why my dish was so meaty while my friend was confused as to why he had bits of chicken. Server never checked on us unless we stared at her until eye contact was made. \n\nBased on all the reviews, I guess this place is a hit or miss.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WB8mPwmJ3ZfLlZOAxAB_ww"}
