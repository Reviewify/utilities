Main, and they're now abbreviating the gallery to WSG, which I guess makes sense seeing as they're not on Washington anymore.\n\nThe space is bright and clean, with white walls, hardwood floors and lots of light. They offer a mix of paintings, sketches and prints as well as three-dimensional art, ranging from geometric abstracts to landscapes to whimsical metal people sculptures made from appliances. All are made by regional artists.\n\nI'm not really their target audience since I can't really afford hundreds of dollars for original art, but they did have some nice smaller prints at prices the little people could afford. I was tempted by a few smaller pieces that were under $40.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X8aDgRgxJstVeU0MZF9ujg"}
