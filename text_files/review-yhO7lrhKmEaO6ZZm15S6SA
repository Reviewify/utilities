It's hidden in that little nook on the corner of Fifth and Green Street. It's in the location across from where Bombay Grill used to be.  The staff is very friendly and are very welcoming! Whenever I go in or even call in, I'm always greeted by a happy face or a happy \"Hello!\" The pho here is awesome! I always order the beef pho and it never disappoints. It's around $9-$10 for any pho and they give you a heaping plate full of additions! The broth, noodles and bean sprouts are more than enough to make you feel full and satisfied when you're done.  Bon app\u00e9tit, friends!", "business_id": "5_cn7M-9swHrFbnqZtYGBQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-19", "type": "review"}
