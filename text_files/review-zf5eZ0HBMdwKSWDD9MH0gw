Went yesterday, got the lunch special for $8.95. Apparently the portion size has decreased, but the flavors were still delicious (so say my coworkers). I'm used to takeout Thai lunch specials with huge containers of soup and styrofoam takeout boxes filled to the brim with an entree, so when my tiny bowl of lemongrass soup arrived, I was taken aback. Having eaten the whole meal, I'll say that it was the perfect amount for a starter. Enough to whet the appetite and not fill you up. Flavorwise, it was a nice balance of hot and sour. The chicken satay was lovely and my pad thai was as delicious today as leftovers as it was yesterday when I ordered it. Plus, my coworkers and I were able to walk there, order, eat and walk back in just about an hour, so it fits nicely in a lunchbreak!", "business_id": "KzgI3kFHxYdf-l3e0U-mdw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-06", "type": "review"}
