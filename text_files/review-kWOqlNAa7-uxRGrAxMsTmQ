I love that I can always find my size in whatever I'm looking for. For the most part, I shop in the Juniors section, but I also like hitting up Topshop and the shoe section, of course.\n\nI had the sweetest girl help me in the Juniors section, her name was Mikaela (not sure I spelled that right). She helped me and my friend from start to finish while helping all the other customers too! \n\nShe rang us up quickly while making great conversation. I felt so taken care of.\n\nAlthough Nordstrom isn't the cheapest place to shop, I absolutely love its styles and service. I would shop here much more often if I had the financial backing to do so!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ncEQCb2Wjk1XfxKxrQD2aQ"}
