All I will say at this point is we should have a 0 stars rating, their case was a joke and they lost completely. To this day I find amusement in the fact that they tried to counter sue and strong arm to get us to drop our case. I am sure this works and scares folks in most cases, difference here is I have the ability to fight them. That and my case against them was pretty ironclad, they couldn't refute the pictures. Their appeal was purely an attempt to delay payment as interest begins (10%) within 30 days of a final judgement and you better believe I will start adding that in considering they are 20 days post final judgement and yet to make any contact (laughingly refusing a certified letter to their lawyers office, nice try guys I sent multiples of those and all the other offices accepted which means you're officially on the clock to pay)\n\nSo now that they allowed it to go this far and the judgement is final and can not be appealed it also becomes public record and I will happily post it to each and every review place in hopes that people wise up and steer very clear of any essex property trust entity. Judgement below and note that we owe nothing on their feeble attempt at a counter suit. All this because these fools wouldnt simply repair some pipes when it was requested of them.\n\n07/20/2012 NOTICE OF ENTRY OF JUDGMENT AFTER TRIAL DE NOVO ON APPEAL\nMAILED TO RESPECTIVE PARTIES/COUNSEL.
