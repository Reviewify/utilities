I love Cupkates, so far it's my favorite in the bay Area, much better than Kara's and Sprinkles too! The cupcakes are always delish, moist, and satisfying. I always get the Red Velvet and Salted Caramel. The others are fantastic too, but these two are my absolute favorite!", "business_id": "zqvFNZq8q86V7QOcpURcSg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-09", "type": "review"}
