I love Cupkates, so far it's my favorite in the bay Area, much better than Kara's and Sprinkles too!  The cupcakes are always delish, moist, and satisfying.   I always get the Red Velvet and Salted Caramel.  The others are fantastic too, but these two are my absolute favorite!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zqvFNZq8q86V7QOcpURcSg"}
