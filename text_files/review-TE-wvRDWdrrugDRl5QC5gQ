I don't expect my nails to stay in tact for long at all, but after a day!? Damn! All the ladies here were amazingly friendly and they actually did a great job with the gel, I guess its the gels fault for chipping. I'll be back here with my mom thats for sure. She loves a good massage during her mani/pedi, lets hope the gel stays on a bit longer!", "business_id": "JzUKGhY7XeYxOYm1Ka9Kig", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-10", "type": "review"}
