Damn! \n\nAll the ladies here were amazingly friendly and they actually did a great job with the gel, I guess its the gels fault for chipping. \n\nI'll be back here with my mom thats for sure. She loves a good massage during her mani/pedi, lets hope the gel stays on a bit longer!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JzUKGhY7XeYxOYm1Ka9Kig"}
