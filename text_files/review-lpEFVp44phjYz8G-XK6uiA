If you go to bear's lair on an off night, then be prepared for a pretty boring time unless you go there with enough people to entertain yourself.  BEAT THE CLOCK FRIDAYS are absolutely a must for anyone in the area but be sure to get there early to get a table! At 4 o' clock $5 pitchers, at 5 o' clock $6 pitchers, at 6 o' clock $7 pitchers...you get the picture. You basically drink as much as you can before the hour changes and the pitchers get more expensive ha. It truly brings all Cal students together and you can't go to one of these days without seeing at least a couple people you know. Otherwise sometimes they have beer pong out and other times people will just gather and drink, and it is also a great place to watch sports. oh and p.s. how awesome is it that Berkeley has a bar on its campus??? yes, bear's lair is in the student union ha", "business_id": "s2Wb3UxXVPU9CV0R2shSuA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-06", "type": "review"}
