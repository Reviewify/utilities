Amazing variety, delicious flavors, incredibly low prices. If you come to princeton, GO HERE!  They make their own icecream from cows they have on their own farm. It tastes extremely creamy and fresh. They also have really original and delicious flavors you can't find anywhere else. Favorites are: Raspberry cream sorbet, chocolate chocolate almond, and peanut butter in vanilla.  I've lived all over the country and have never found a better place!", "business_id": "vqQ_nyjIyLzoO9c6yiw9mg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-06", "type": "review"}
