Love his friendly and helpful attitude. He doesn't treat his patients like they are impeding on his precious time. Great bedside manner, takes time to explain things to an old man with bad hearing like my father. My dad felt much better today after just seeing Dr. Kerbavez, even though the treatments have yet to begin.", "business_id": "1ojiJQY6y3FPusO3kn-NWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-24", "type": "review"}
