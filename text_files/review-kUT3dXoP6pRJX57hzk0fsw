I went here about 4 years ago with my husband for a massage and facial. It was the day he proposed. We had this appt, planned to go home and shower then dinner reservations and off to NYC. They suggested a couples massage instead of individual and basically pulled down a wall between us and charged us extra. My massage was okay but I was badly bruised after around my neck area. It looked like hickeys, so awful. My husband said his was just ok. I then waited in the same room for my esthetician. A women came in and asked if she could get me some water after about 45 minutes, I replied no just my esthetician please. She came in about 30 minutes later and introduces herself as not the person I made my appt with. She explained that my girl called in and she had to get a sitter last minute and come in that's why the long wait. The facial was good but she talked a lot. We had to cancel dinner reservation as we would have had to go there greasy and unshowered. The owner didn't apologize at all. I feel that they should have given me the option of waiting over an hour for my facial or rescheduling. Apparently my time was not as valuable. I work in a dayspa myself and find them to be extremely unprofessional. No apology offered or incentive to get me back in....The best part was the free parking.", "business_id": "pb843_vpnReGvhSz_zGWVA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}
