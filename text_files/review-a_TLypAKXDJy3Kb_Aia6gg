Watching a game?  Stuffing your face with previously frozen, subsequently deep fried foods that are covered in buffalo sauce or cheese in order to mask the fact that the actual food tastes like salted rubber?  For its decor that reminds me of a college freshman's attempt to decorate a dorm room?  The point is, I don't really know.\n\nI suppose this wouldn't be a bad place to go watch a game...assuming you can't get a seat at Hudson Grille, right across the street.  That also assumes that you don't eat anything while you're here, and your only consumption is that of a bunch of beer.  So, it's a good palce to get yourself drunk in a cheap kind of way, and that's about it...because we need more of those places.", "type": "review", "business_id": "26GVusr-8mreOg9Qe61rSA"}
