But fact of the matter is, it's sub-par Japanese food that isn't really even that cheap. \n\nThe rolls were hard and tasted like they were made a long time ago. The \"spicy\" lobster roll I got was obviously flavored with sriracha, and all of the three rolls I got looked like they were the same roll with other stuff on top. I was excited for the side salad, but it was mostly the most pathetic looking bits of lettuce left, and there were no toppings left (wontons, etc). The girl served it to us anyway. And my edamame was browning, wilted and gross. \n\nIf you aren't a starving USC in desperate need of a quick meal, you really should find your Japanese food fix elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "37Va6ESAdLWYUtcZ5-DaAA"}
