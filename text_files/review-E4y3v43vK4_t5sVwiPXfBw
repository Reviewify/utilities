As good as it gets!\" cause seriously, it's as good as it gets here for the neighborhood.\n\nTry looking for a healthy alternative... you'll be looking for a while.\n\nSurprisingly the place is very clean, and the owner is super nice.  They're not stingy with their garlic sauces and their food is tasty.\n\nI go for the healthier option, grilled chicken breast with no rice. Just extra salad and hummus.  For a hole in the wall place, their hummus is pretty tasty. More flavor than most of the these kabab places I've been to. \n\nI won't be working in the area any more but i'm glad i know a healthy spot in the area if I'm ever back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "o_lhnpunYQ8YSlu7vso5Ng"}
