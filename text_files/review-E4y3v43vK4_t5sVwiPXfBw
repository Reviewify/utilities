As good as it gets!\" cause seriously, it's as good as it gets here for the neighborhood. Try looking for a healthy alternative... you'll be looking for a while. Surprisingly the place is very clean, and the owner is super nice.  They're not stingy with their garlic sauces and their food is tasty. I go for the healthier option, grilled chicken breast with no rice. Just extra salad and hummus.  For a hole in the wall place, their hummus is pretty tasty. More flavor than most of the these kabab places I've been to.  I won't be working in the area any more but i'm glad i know a healthy spot in the area if I'm ever back!", "business_id": "o_lhnpunYQ8YSlu7vso5Ng", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}
