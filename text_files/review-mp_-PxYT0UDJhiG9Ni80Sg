Tastes great, good amount of cheese (never have to ask for extra), easy to order and delivery is usually on time. Once I had a really late delivery and an issue with my order, but the manager got on the phone and was super cool about it all, got me double my order and to my door in no time! I thought the mushrooms were canned, but I was wrong! They are pre-cooked, so I just have to ask for uncooked mushrooms, good to know and very cool that they will specialize orders for customers. Sausage is small bits, not large like pepperoni... not to shabby though and tastes pretty good. Pizzas are pretty big and generally affordable until you start getting picky about specific toppings... most pizza places charge you up the ass for toppings anyways. \n\nIt's a great place for lunch too - stop by if you get a lunch break, they usually have great deals... like 2 pieces of pizza and a drink.  Salads are alright... heard the sandwiches and chicago style pizza are good too, but haven't had them personally.  Customer service is great and so are the delivery guys. Overall, I'll keep ordering from them... definitely better than any chain pizza place in UTC!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XqKhC29UQ1ya1Py3bTzvAA"}
