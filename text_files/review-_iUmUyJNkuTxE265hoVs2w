Football & basketball programs have been horrible, was expecting more. To think I switched my fanhood from USC to UCLA just because I'm not a Bruin, sigh.  Classes: they're decent but man a lot of the teachers are pompous douches, we get it, you're smart and yes you're here for research but at least get to know your students. Libraries: actually really good. Especially Night Powell, I mean 24 hour library? Good for last minute cramming and all nighters leading up to Midterms & Finals. Student body: good diversity and a lot of cool and attractive people.  Clean campus, a lot of stores, banks, restaurants on campus. Good food and Westwood itself is very clean and safe.", "business_id": "rBeILr7kFzi7iPxSpP-TWg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}
