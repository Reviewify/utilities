To think I switched my fanhood from USC to UCLA just because I'm not a Bruin, sigh. \n\nClasses: they're decent but man a lot of the teachers are pompous douches, we get it, you're smart and yes you're here for research but at least get to know your students.\n\nLibraries: actually really good. Especially Night Powell, I mean 24 hour library? Good for last minute cramming and all nighters leading up to Midterms & Finals.\n\nStudent body: good diversity and a lot of cool and attractive people. \n\nClean campus, a lot of stores, banks, restaurants on campus. Good food and Westwood itself is very clean and safe.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rBeILr7kFzi7iPxSpP-TWg"}
