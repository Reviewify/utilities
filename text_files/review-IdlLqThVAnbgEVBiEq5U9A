Not too bad, but far from the best I've had. The hummus was good. I just had the shawarma sandwich which was big but the taste was a bit off. I don't know if it was just the spices or whatever. Service good, price was right on. Since I'm only visiting town I won't be back, but probably would in a pinch if it were the only middle eastern place around.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yqQ6Umb2Rc9mJcsgxswt-A"}
