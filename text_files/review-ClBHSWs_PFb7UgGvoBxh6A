I did not order ahead but the owner was so accommodating that she made me special cupcakes on the spot (not included in the deal) AND try an additional cupcake at no extra charge!  I was impressed with the cupcakes especially the red velvet, rainbow, and dolce de leche.  Everything was delicious.  I would definitely come back again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "h37hllqEt6v9HGqzdiupow"}
