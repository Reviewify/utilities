I loved it from beginning to end.  The staff was warm and welcoming.  Our server Emily was fantastic.  The food was tremendous.   Everything was so good.  Stared with the beet salad that had an incredible miso dressing and oysters that were so fresh and sweet.  Shared the roast chicken and it was everything I hoped for and more. Added the two special side dishes for the evening - bone marrow with toast and brussel sprouts roasted in duck fat.  The meal was exceptional.  Had the sour cream cheese cake and the affogato for dessert.  Both were wonderful.  I love this restaurant.", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}
