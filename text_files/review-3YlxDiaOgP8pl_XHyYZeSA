I bought half a dozen for a friend's birthday. They sure looked pretty, but I don't think cupcakes should be all about SIZE and appearance. Giving me a giant ball of frosting on top of the cake won't do it for me, sorry. My perfect cupcake is all about proportions, consistency, and delivery. Sprinkles pretty much screws up on all three. WAY too much frosting to cake ratio, cake more like muffin consistency, and my experience buying them wasn't all that great either. Over-hype, under-whelming. And at more than $3 a cupcake, it was not too good. Georgetown Cupcakes in my hood is better, even though it's like half he size....because it TASTES better and doesn't try to gag me with all that frosting! We had to scrape it off with a knife to avoid getting instant diabetes.....", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-11", "type": "review"}
