I think they've change ownership like 3 times now? Anyways, the interior was tacky, and looked like a cheap wedding reception. It was better before they remodeled. We ordered the small appetizer platter, with a couple of eggplant dishes, which were pretty good, and the grape leaves were served hot, which I love, and the Tabbouleh, oh god. This was a joke. Why serve it if you are a Persian restaurant to begin with? It was actually sad. It consisted of parsley, a few pieces of tomato and onion, and then UNCOOKED wheat! Like, it was literally uncooked. Crunchy! No lemon juice, no olive oil..completely dry! it was bad, like worse then the boxed shit. Then we ordered the lamb, and chicken combo with the lima bean rice. The rice was good. The lamb was decent, but the chicken was pretty bad. Under cooked, and very very fatty. We did get dessert, which was good, but i think they were already pre made stuff. We got this vanilla gelatto shit, and the spumoni. Both good. The price was steep as well. Like I said, I feel bad, but hopefully they can take this as constructive criticism.", "business_id": "k3QGiTcSDp0D_4ZrpBVDpg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-06-23", "type": "review"}
