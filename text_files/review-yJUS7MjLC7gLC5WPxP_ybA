Life is good.  Alright, well.. It's not Paris, and I'm pretty sure there weren't cobble stones, BUT it was pretty dang close.  I'd have to say I'm pretty guilty of judging people who don't eat any meat in their breakfast, but I am now proud to say that I am a believer! The Vegetable Scramble at this place basically tasted like they went out to the garden to pick fresh veggies... it was so fresh. The hint of feta cheese made it that more scrumptious.  Next time you feel like giving the non-meats a chance at breakfast, swing by and give it a try!", "business_id": "Dh3X5NuzAcFZSSl72a5lWg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-28", "type": "review"}
