And I am so thankful. \nAlyssa is a pro. We talked for a bit about what I wanted and she gave me the confidence to finally totally change my look. I love my new adorable short hair. \nI also received a complimentary head, shoulder, and hand massage. And the ladies there were so lovely and gracious. \n\nand the best part? because I was referred there by a regular, I received $20 off my hair cut! \n\nSo overall, my best haircut experience yet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pt5lXkpGD1LRv0zLpCn0KA"}
