And I am so thankful.  Alyssa is a pro. We talked for a bit about what I wanted and she gave me the confidence to finally totally change my look. I love my new adorable short hair.  I also received a complimentary head, shoulder, and hand massage. And the ladies there were so lovely and gracious.  and the best part? because I was referred there by a regular, I received $20 off my hair cut!  So overall, my best haircut experience yet.", "business_id": "Pt5lXkpGD1LRv0zLpCn0KA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}
