I will coming here every year as long as they don't band me. I only had one bad experience with this place. I was yelled at by a fellow movie watcher for smoking. I think if your going to go to a outdoor event be prepare to be around smokers, anyway. I will bring my family here next time and enjoy the food and drinks and activities before the movie starts. I have been to Cinespia and thought that place was great and now I don't even want to go there ever again. Love, love this place.", "business_id": "BPT-D30wcq-_SOU8pY6zTw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-07", "type": "review"}
