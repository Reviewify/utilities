I also have popped in for lunch with co-workers or friends.  Most of the time the service is pleasant, and attentive, and the food, beer, and wine selection is good, nothing over the top.  \n\nRecently a few of my co-workers and I decided to stop in for lunch.  We were a party of 4.  Tory Row has an odd seating arrangement, long narrow tables or short, small, stubby ones against the wall. You seat yourself here.  There wasn't room at one of the long table for four of us, so we opted sit at the shorter ones and just move two together.  \n\nAfter we had ordered, we were approached by someone, not sure if he was waitstaff or what exactly and he very rudely told us to move the tables apart, that he would get in trouble if the manager walked in and saw this.  We joked, and moved them apart an inch and asked if that was ok, before agreeing to move them.  He told us we were being \"ball-busters\" in a VERY NON FUNNY sort of way.  He was rude, and continued to stare at us from the back, and seemingly gossip with his co-workers.  We decided to tell our waitress we were leaving, cancel our order, we were going somewhere else for lunch.  He came to the front and loudly said, \"SEE YA!!!\" as we walked out.  There are far too many other places to go to in Harvard Square for lunch without being made to feel uncomfortable.  \n\nSorry Tory Row, it's kinda too bad, as a  PREVIOUS regular customer I have no interest in giving you more of my business, for a mediocre at best atmosphere, and limited customer attentiveness.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A"}
