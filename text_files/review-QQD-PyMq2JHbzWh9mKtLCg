And one of the things that I know is that U of I is one of the best around.   As someone who had a bit of life experience under her belt by the time she came here, I can say without a doubt that this is a great place for a wide variety of people.  The caveat?  You have to work for it.  It's not dropped in your lap.  Your professors won't hold your hand, the department you're in won't hold your hand, and the administration certainly won't hold your hand.  If I had a question in class, I'd go straight to the prof.  If there was a scheduling conflict for a class I needed, I'd go to my advisor and they could usually work it out.   While at UIUC, my friends ran the gamut from international students to suburban kids to kids from rural illinois.  The diversity is out there.  If you're in LAS or ACES, it may be a bit harder to find.  But it's there.   The classes here are top notch.  I studied engi-nerding, so maybe I'm biased.  But it's not so much what I actually learned in class.  It's really more that I learned how to problem-solve, and how to apply what I learned to real-life situations.  I no longer work in engineering, but I don't feel my undergraduate degree was for naught.
