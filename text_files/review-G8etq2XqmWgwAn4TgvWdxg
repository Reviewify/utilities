The service isn't the best but its ok. Today was a different story..... Me and my coworker were eating lunch at this location and she found a roach in her food. We took pictures and notified the manager. He was very apologetic and offered to pay for our meals and offer us a free meal whenever we decided to come back. Thanks but no thanks, we will not go back to this location again", "business_id": "-jYPhaseRPICBaFvM63Qbw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-02", "type": "review"}
