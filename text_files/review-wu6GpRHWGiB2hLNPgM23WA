Lots of options for both cookies and ice cream flavors. Cookies are pretty good. I like mine a little softer but I suppose too soft and they wouldn't hold the ice cream well. Ice cream is also pretty good. A bit artificial in taste but not bad. They also copied the ole Costco $1.50 hotdog and soda deal if you're feeling more savory then sweet. Must try this myself!\n\nHonestly though it's a steal for the price. It's usually busy as well so be prepared for a wait.", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
