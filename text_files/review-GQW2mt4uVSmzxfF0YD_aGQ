Great ambiance and decor, the restaurant feels very open and spacious with it's tri - level layout and high ceiling. Service has been great all three times I've eaten here and there is convenient free parking in the garage next door.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-30", "type": "review"}
