The quality selection of both traditional and Korean influenced burgers and the friendly staff keeps me coming back regularly.   Pro tips: 1) The bulgogi (Korean BBQ) burger is fantastic and definitely worth a try. For a notch up in awesomeness, go spicy! \"Oh, my spicy!\" 2) If you get a classic burger, increase the tastiness levels by getting the spicy version!  They add the spicy Korean sauce to the standard burger 3) Premium add-ons, such as grilled onions or grilled jalape\u00f1os, are a tad expensive in my opinion.  If you're feeling cheap, just add the jalape\u00f1os from the toppings bar.  All toppings in the topping bar are free, so load up!!! 4) Get some fries!  The fries here have a crisp that is to die for!  Gets some of Mrs. Lee's homemade sauce (1000 island like) for dipping perfection!", "business_id": "dw3ukrM4VTRfgJEkCB-cIA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-13", "type": "review"}
