And don't get me started on what \"latte\" has come to mean--weak, milky water that dosn't even taste of beans. Thankfully, there are some baristas who still know how to make coffee, and even more thankfully, there are still coffee joints that care about good beans. JP's Java has both. The coffee tastes like coffee. If you don't like coffee, please, continue to swill your Starbucks and have a nice day. I'll brave a trip over to JP's even though I can't stand being near campus. That's the one thing I don't love about JPs--the location. But during the summer when the students are largely gone, and especially during summer weekend mornings when students are gone, sleeping, and recovering from hangovers, this place is really special. I sit out back with a cup of not-too-hot latte and marvel that somewhere in this mainstream-coffee-loving America that are still a handful of places that don't water down their coffee to please the masses.", "business_id": "DARh6yjrGGVZ7R3Gdh4CMA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-08", "type": "review"}
