If the line is short, go in and wait. it sucks, but no more than any other post office. If the line is long, proceed to step two. Step Two: walk 4 more feet to Book Culture, and peruse. Once bored with endless books about Proust, exit. Walk back four feet. Look at the line. If short, go in. If still long, proceed to step three. Step Three: wander to Tom's on the corner. Avoid the food and go straight for the giant milkshake. Drink milkshake. Return to post office, suck it up and wait, full of chocolaty goodness.", "business_id": "Fje1a15z84NYIjMQxhOBIA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-06", "type": "review"}
