Love it!  They have amazing greasy chips with lots of different sauces to try out.  I pretty much made a meal out of that.  We got the veggie fajitas and split it.  I liked that there were so many different veggies in it.  The price you cannot beat it.  It was so cheap.  The lights are REALLY bright but other than that, not much to complain about.  The staff was super nice and we just had some cervezas to drink.  Next time I head down to the Paign...I might have to go back to Mas amigos....", "type": "review", "business_id": "gaR5jDvZsOC0RQeY-W1eqQ"}
