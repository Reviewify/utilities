We had to wait to be seated inside for only about 5-10 minutes max  and the staff made sure to check on us and make sure we knew that they knew we were waiting and that we'd be seated asap.  That was very considerate of them. Once seated (by a big window which offered nice lighting), we had prompt service on drinks and bread (two diff types of bread: raisin and some sort of multigrain/nut mixture).  The waitress was friendly and not overbearing.  The menu was simple to order from and the food came out quickly.   The ambiance was modern, yet laid back casual.  We went in shorts and didn't feel out of place.   My husband ordered the seafood enchiladas and I ordered the Salmon Steak.  They do offer a simple kids menu (think mac n cheese, chicken strips, PB&J, etc),  which is very helpful for parents.  Prices were not too bad... close to $15 to $17 a plate and up to $25 for a steak (fillet).  The kids menu prices were considerably lower like maybe $6 to $8 or so. As for the food:  I tasted the seafood enchiladas and my first response was, \"Fresh.\"  As for my salmon steak, I can honestly say it was one of the BEST grilled salmon steaks I've ever tasted.  The manager said that they use mesquite to grill them, which made the outside a tad crunchy and the inside SOOO juicy.  VERY, very tasty,  Highly recommended. Overall, we were all very pleased with The Raven Grill.  I can't wait to go back!", "business_id": "JyOh6zIV1sGINuEnzOBckw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}
