I have been to a handful of Ethiopian restaurants in DC and this makes the cut. The vegetable platter is very yummy with EVERY dish in the platter was excellent.  The ambiance is no frills with tables packed in the restaurant. We sat near the window--which was much nicer.  The service was slow, but we weren't in a rush.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  I will be back.", "business_id": "tbg4gR3jUUllR28cySo2kg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-24", "type": "review"}
