I will say that Matsuri isn't bad. Not at all. However, it's also not great. It's completely average. My friend and I both got the sashimi plate, and it was ok. Not that much fish for the price, and the quality was average. For me, I think the barometer of a great Japanese restaurant is the miso soup. It sounds silly, but it actually takes a lot of skill to make miso soup, starting with the hondashi. A lot of places skimp on that part or just don't know how to do it. And you can tell. Matsuri's miso soup wasn't watery or bland, but it was, again, average. No \"Ahhhhhhhh\" feeling that a great miso soup brings (the whole \"umami\" thing). The decor was kind of kitschy, too. And I didn't care much for banging on the taiko drum for new customers. Whatever happened to just shouting, \"Irashaimase!\" If you're looking for bad ass soul-satisfying O.G. Japanese sushi fare, drive the extra distance to Sushi Gen in Little Tokyo.", "business_id": "RiZqeuLN-3y04yh4c20Y0A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-07", "type": "review"}
