I was in search of some bananas since I was cramping up from my run the day before and sure enough they even had bananas!  They also offer a grill area for lunch up until 3 pm. They serve burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, and from what I saw Philly cheese steaks. It looked as appealing as convenience store food could look.  I stick to the junk food. It's cheaper than the restaurants if you just want a bottle of soda or a bag of chips.", "business_id": "4Mxc95eqsqvrMXJOSp51bw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-06", "type": "review"}
