Great place for drinks any night of the week, sounds from some of Atlanta's best Djs. Drink specials almost every night. Locally owned and operated. Relax in this Urban lounge/cafe, enjoy coffee, cakes, liquors, beers and small menu of made to order dishes. The Cuban sandwich, oh yeah!! There is outdoor seating as well and they have heaters if you ask, they will turn them on. The staff is the best in town, Prem Mixed drinks $7. Lots and Lots of cute girls here!!", "business_id": "ld5H3Nf3xhUuvybL1uMFng", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-12-06", "type": "review"}
