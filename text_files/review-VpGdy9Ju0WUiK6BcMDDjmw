I guess you can say that I've become a little obsessed with finding things organic.  I love Whole Foods but who doesn't want to save money or help an organization provide affordable organic food to its community?\n\nThe first time I drove down to their stand I was a little late.  They start selling their fruits and vegetables around 3 p.m. and I got there around 4:30 p.m.  Unfortunately I missed out on a lot of great fruits.  I bought some lettuce, oranges, asparagus, and carrots, which are all organic.  I paid $3 for all this.  They charge $1 per pound for any kind of produce.  I also bought one of their fruit cups, which I devoured on my way home.  All the fruits were so sweet and delicious.  So I decided that I didn't want to miss out on all the good stuff, so I signed up for their $8 a bag program in which I get $8 worth of organic produce per week for one month (spending about $32 per month on organic produce).\n\nI couldn't wait for Thursday to come around again to see what kind of fruits or vegetables I would get.  Well I was so happy to see what came in my bag:  cauliflower, oranges, cucumber, potatoes, beets, fava beans, broccoli, and huge strawberries.  Along with the bag I received an email on how to cook the fava beans and how to use it in a simple recipe.  I haven't tried the recipe yet, but it sounds really good.  My favorite, though, were the strawberries:  huge, sweet, and delicious.  I devoured the whole basket in one setting.\n\nOverall, this is a great cause.  If you want to find out more about this organization, check out their website:  www.csuinc.org.  Now I have something else to look forward to on Thursdays besides Grey's Anatomy and The Office.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IDcE6KnGoOEkxaQKhvwMQA"}
