It isn't a large place and has mostly 2 tops, perfect for a date night. She always gets the maxa platter. Not sure if that is how you spell it but that is how it is spelled on their web page. I unknowingly enough order something else for variety. Funny thing though because we usually end up sharing. Sharing really means me saying\"hey honey would you like some of mine\"? In which her response is \"I might try it but you can have as much of mine as you want\". That's the answer I was looking for. On to the food! This last time I visited I tried the \"Fetter Treat\". Which in my experience was lamb on a bed of rice (Not white rice but not sure what kind) with pine nuts. It was very good for what it was, and it came with a small lettuce and tomato salad with a lemon dressing. I really liked it but I think I would have been slightly disappointed had my girlfriend not gotten the maxa platter. On the menu the Fetter Treat says it is cooked with mushrooms and onions and a savory mushroom sauce. I saw very few mushrooms and not a drop of sauce. All in all I would probably get it again. The maxa platter on the other hand was pure heaven. I could gorge myself on the Tabooli and Baba Ganooj. The Baba Ganooj had a great smoky flavor and I was really impressed at how fresh everything tasted. With the maxa platter it also has an Artichoke Salad which is really just Artichokes covered in some delicious sauce. Also, huge portions of feta cheese, hummus and tomatoes and olives in the middle.The maxa platter is all cold dishes which is also why I got something hot. Everything was really good and we enjoyed our dinner very much so.", "business_id": "6CjVFTO7F-q8BP7oQKB_9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-12", "type": "review"}
