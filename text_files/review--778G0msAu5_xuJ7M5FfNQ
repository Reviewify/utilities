Everything is written up on a chalk board wall but the waiters are very knowledgeable about their wines and can help you pair.  The portions are enough for two and we tried 6 different dishes on the menu, all very good.   It's a small place (maybe seats 30) so you'll want to make reservations.  I called two hours before hand and they had a free table and put a reserved sign on it for me!  The vibe is just...chill... great food, good wine...nice crowd...never too loud... and you can sit for hours without being hassled. Highly recommend the downtown gem.", "business_id": "8polKN4I6fJx1t8pPxogVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-30", "type": "review"}
