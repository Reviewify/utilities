Way better then the steak i had at Harris Steak House in San Francisco. I ordered the Prime In bone NY Steak strip, and had it ordered rare. The steak was rare( not more, not less..it was perfect), it was really tender, had great flavor to it. The bread was probably the second best thing i had there.. bread and butter.. it was omg.. i can't even explain it. The sauteed  mushrooms was delightful as well as the broccoli with hollandaise sauce (but i wish they would cut the broccoli smaller, and not in one clump). The service was excellent, but i was our waitress, was easier to be seen so i could get some help, seem like she was disappear for a little bit.\n\nI would come back here any time.. wish they had one in nor cal .", "type": "review", "business_id": "2LrIkZB7mOwu8-9OVhjWfQ"}
