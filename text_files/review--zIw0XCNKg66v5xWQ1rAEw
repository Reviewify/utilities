They recently changed their menu so I was sad to see some stuff go, but this time of year when it's cool the open air is wonderful. (Kinda slow service though.) There is a bar, but its not very good for watching sports - theres only one t.v. There homemade beer is pretty good and their cider is lovely for girls who aren't into beer. I gave it 3 stars though because its pretty average all around. Its not a place that I get excited about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-4ppieQivAHq4flJXwqy0g"}
