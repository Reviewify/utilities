I feel like those who aren't true burger aficionados get lost in the hype surrounding Mr. Bartley's and don't realize that the place is just ... okay.\n\nLast time I was here, I tried substituting sweet potato fries on my burger and got hit with a whopping $12 bill for a burger, fries, and soda.  Woah!  And I was not in the mood to fight it.\n\nAnd no bathroom?  Really?  Is it only in Massachusetts that eating establishments aren't required to provide restroom facilities for their patrons?\n\n(RF O'Sullivans is just a few minutes away and has much, much better burgers, and it's quite clear how much it's going to cost.  O'Sullivans is the place for true burgerhounds.)\n\nBut Bartley's has a couple of saving graces.  First of all, the menu is fun.  Half the fun of coming to Bartley's is reading the menu.  (Of course, you could do this outside, for free.)  The menu author has a great knack for making fun of famous people.\n\nSecond, it fits the vibe of Harvard Square oh-so-well.  If you're new to Harvard Square or visiting from out-of-town, you'll get a great sense of the oddity that is Harvard Square.\n\nUpdate: You know, the whole \"no bathroom\" thing is really bugging me.  Dropping you down to 1 star on that basis alone.  How can you serve food and drink and not offer a place to go to the bathroom?", "type": "review", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg"}
