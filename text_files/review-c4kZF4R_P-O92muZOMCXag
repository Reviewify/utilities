A decent place for carnivores. Ruby's has a great location near the University which makes it very convenient for those who have to grab some grub in between classes. The service is decent, they aren't overly friendly but they also won't spit in your food. I have always had good food here from the meat selections to the sides everything has also been good. Food is served hot, fresh and is made with quality ingredients. The only reason I honestly didn't give it another star is that I have always experienced a very funky smell when in there and it is pretty unappetizing. Also I think it is a little too expensive for what you get. Overall, it IS a nice convenient place to grab some grub, the service ain't great and there is a mystery funk in the air. Check it out anyway, maybe it's just me.", "business_id": "odf4UIHxEsyEfSsa9vKXDQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-09-05", "type": "review"}
