Anyway, I have to say that the beer list, while small, is very impressive. The Hitachino Ginger beer is on the list, and I've only seen it two other places in Atlanta, and they have the favorite high gravity beers of all Atlantans, St. Bernardus and Three Philosophers. I had a concern about the pricing on my original review, but Bill (the owner) sent me a message to double check-- it appears there was just a typo on my menu and they are not, in fact, charging $17 for a St. Bernardus, it is a reasonable $8. The food was pretty good, I had the fish and chips and the wings. I liked the wings, the flavor was good and they weren't overcooked like you find at a lot of bars/pubs, and the chips were really great. I wasn't a fan of the batter on the fish, but I squeezed a little lemon on and it tasted better. They also actually give you enough tartar sauce to dip! The bartenders were great, I got everything quickly and with no fuss, and even though there was a large party it didn't seem to be a problem with anything. I also want to give a big thumbs up to Bill, the owner. He keeps an eye on the Yelp page and responded immediately to my original post. He's very concerned with customer service and personally involved in the restaurant day to day-- if you have any complaints, he seems ready and willing to discuss with you and add another regular to his list! (also, the music was awesome. I don't know if it was a personal mix or a station, but it was everything from Audioslave to Cake to Sublime and I loved it)", "business_id": "1i63faxXI1TQ7pNlLp3IPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-07", "type": "review"}
