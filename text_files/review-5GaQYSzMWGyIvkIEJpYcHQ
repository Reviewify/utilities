What a beautiful restaurant, with such a great open upstairs area that easily accommodated our party of 25+. The executive chef came around to chat with all of us, and even shared a new tamarind sauce he had concocted -- which was delicious, by the way. What seemed like endless skewers of succulent meat came around our table over the course of 1.5 hours (they'll keep coming until you flip over your disk from green to red signaling: STOP!). I didn't even make it to the huge sidebar downstairs, although those who did raved about it. The basket of baked cheese bread and fried plantains and polenta were the only non-meat items I had, and I inhaled them because they were so good. If I had to limit my meat intake, I'd have to narrow it down from 14 to these 4 favorites: - lamb chop - linguica - pork tenderloin with spice dry rub - turkey breast wrapped in bacon (mmm.... bacon) I'm currently on a veggie diet, so please don't have a birthday party at Pampas for another month or so. Thanks! I'll be there for cocktails though. Man oh man, those are some strong caipirinhas.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-05", "type": "review"}
