It's a perfect balance between grungy college bar and grown-up lounge, so appeals to grad students like myself. The help is freindly and make an effort to greet you by name after only a few visits. The very affordable drinks make it my \"go-to\" place.", "business_id": "AcvgZ2nXndVnJZlofk4u3A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-11", "type": "review"}
