The service is wonderful, and the food is delicious! I am a huge fan of their spring rolls, and honestly just cannot get enough of them! The spring rolls are always crispy and delicious - definitey my favourite item. I also personally recommend their vermicelli bowls (especially those that come with the spring rolls). I really feel like Pho Dau Bo is excellent quality, especially for such affordable prices.", "business_id": "yoPhGOboGuj9svBwWp3gOA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}
