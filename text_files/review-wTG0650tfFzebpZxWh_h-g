The theater was intimate, small, and cozy. The food was so-so. They have $1 hot dogs, $3 White Castles but the sodas are expensive! Great place for dates!!! Yay! Parking is a bit of a problem. Do you know if we can park in the bank parking lot across Colorado Blvd?", "business_id": "iY1sa6KDfSDg4yHwwGonrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-15", "type": "review"}
