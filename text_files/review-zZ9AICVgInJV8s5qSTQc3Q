Tons of delicious ingredients that are all of great quality and fresh, three basic foundations to start your pizza out all for under $15 (give or take a few topings) what more could you want!?! Not only is it an amazing restaurant that is totally affordable, you can come here everyday of the week, have something delicious every time and never repeat the same ingredients! I've only known about the place for 3 weeks and I've already been 4 times! shhhhh!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw"}
