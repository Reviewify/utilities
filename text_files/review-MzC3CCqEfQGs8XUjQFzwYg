It is one of the places he and many of his friends \"have to go to\" when they visit the folks in Lafayette. We all have our special home town favorites. Our waitress told us that \"So many people stop here on their way home from the airport before they even get to grandma's house!\" Their pizza is this crust and is cut up into little squares which is good for sharing. There aren't many exciting options on the menu (but I know I am spoiled since I live in SF) and there is not really anything \"healthy\" except for a plain salad. Might as well forget about calorie counting and get a stromboli or pizza. \"Meet ya at Arni's\" is their motto. Have fun! Oh, and beware... they have not banned smoking in Lafayette yet, so if you're a non-smoker definitely sit in the non-smoking section!", "business_id": "7cv2leiAcS5tUumVSm_KyA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-26", "type": "review"}
