Vinology has improved dramatically in the past two years. This is Ann Arbor's best dining experience with an extensive wine list, a seasonal menu, and locally-sourced foods (when possible). Tonight's meal started with a generous portion of the White Salad, prepared with fris\u00e9e, jicama, pear, lychee, mushroom, and fennel. It was topped with a delicious champagne vinaigrette. Seriously, the portions of the salads were huge. I would be tempted to come here for an appetizer or two and then indulge in the salads. The main entree was the Roasted Venison Loin with quark spaetzle, brussels sprouts, bacon, huckleberries, braised cabbage, and topped with a white peppercorn sauce. The sweetness of the huckleberries with the earthiness of the brussels sprouts made for a surprisingly good combination. What I love about Vinology is that you can order half-plates and full plates for each entree. Personally, the half plates are perfect for enjoying a full course meal that includes an appetizer, a salad, an entree, and dessert at the end. I wish more restaurants would do this so that you are not wasting food. Finally, the meal ended with an Aztec Pave, this gourmet s'more-like morsel of yumminess inspired by the Yucatan. This spicy chocolate mousse-like dessert that included a guajillo chile marshmallow. It was truly the highlight of my meal and nearly moved me to tears. To top it off, the service was impeccable tonight. I've complained about service in the past, but it has changed. For a last meal as an Ann Arbor resident, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. When I return home, I plan to return to Vinology. When others ask about where to eat in Ann Arbor, Vinology will top the list.", "business_id": "qkw4xWWgTufvBs1NcxsFnw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-27", "type": "review"}
