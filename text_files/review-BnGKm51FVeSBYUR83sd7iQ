After some shopping, I dropped in to satiate my curiosity.  Initial observations: smells good, its very clean and modern, the cupcakes are decorated nicely.   Despite the price, I coughed up the dough to buy a chocolate cupcake with cream cheese frosting.  I bite in, expecting my $3.25 to be worth it, and you know what folks, it just didn't have the X factor.  I didn't find the cake to be extremely moist and the cream cheese frosting wasn't really sugary or sweet.  It was at best, \"blah.\"     Looking at other reviews, it appears I should have went for the red velvet cupcake, but unfortunately, I'll be satisfying my future cupcake needs elsewhere.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}
