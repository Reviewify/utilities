I was a lost little boy. The second time I went I came in as a man ready to conquer this place and come out with a hat. Their selection is never ending. I recommend going with a friend to help choose between hats. The people working there are very knowledgeable and helpful. They helped me and my cousin with selections and we both came out of there with rocking hats. We were both getting tons of compliments on our selections the rest of the week.", "business_id": "GjF9aSQzK1k_1nQfjCkb9w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-25", "type": "review"}
