We never have to wait in line because for some reason, this place is always empty. She always gets the poached eggs with pesto and since I'm a can dig anything wrapped in a tortilla, I get the italian burrito. The food is usually pretty spot on, but the quality sometimes varies.

The owner is super friendly too!", "business_id": "crqWT6VmTS-WIq53qMKqOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-12", "type": "review"}
