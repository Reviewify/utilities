Great small place that's only open till 5 and closed on Sundays. The food is great quality, but the prices are a tad high. The wait is long on Thursday's and Friday's. I suggest going a tad early or later other than high noon.", "business_id": "X5wfvGY7sizqKFsaXV3XhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-12", "type": "review"}
