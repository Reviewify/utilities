Usually came down during winter in Utah to enjoy some sunshine and bump shoulders with some movie stars and I did see my share.  I, however, knew my place and kept a respectable distance and didn't get strange.  I laughingly would say, \"I could kick his ass.\"   Of course I am 6'4\" and weigh 250 lbs.  By best score was an 82 and I did Eagle the first hole once.  I will never get to play again because my Uncle Theron died of cancer a few years ago.   I am a former professional landscaper so appreciated the detail in the grooming and maintenance of the grounds even in the winter.  I can only imagine the Spring and Summer beauty.  The greens are superb.  The course is challenging, yet playable.  You need to know how to play with all your clubs to obtain a respectable score.  That's what makes it so fun.  I am a long ball hitter and it's not just a driver and a 8 or 9 iron onto the green.  Each hole requires thinking and the right club.  The clubhouse served great meals.  Fresh Orange Juice was always my favorite and they do make a great hot chocolate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tzp1-EfOw4Zejlohw07Elw"}
