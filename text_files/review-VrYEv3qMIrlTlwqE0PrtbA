In my defense, I bought a groupon for 2 burgers for $6 (which was an amazinggggggg deal) which had to be used, BUT, I will most definitely be back to try their hot dogs.  ANYWAYS, back to the burger. GINORMOUS with stuff pouring out everywhere. 4 Hawaiian rolls! I got the Freiburger (because i really wanted a fried egg) and it was very delicious. The coleslaw in the burger gave it a nice crunch, and I threw in diced tomatoes that I swiped at the condiments bar. Bf had the Hangover and he enjoyed it too (lots of chilli oozing out). The Hawaiian rolls made it super easy to split my burger (vs. the usual hamburger bun - when you try to cut it in half, everything just falls apart). We also split an order of sweet potato fries, which I thought were only okay, and pretty thankful there was ranch lying around to jazz it up.  Seating can be difficult to come by during busy hours, so start table stalking after you place your order. The high rise tables lead to communal seating. Easy street parking.", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-15", "type": "review"}
