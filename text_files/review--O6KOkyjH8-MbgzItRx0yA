While I may not have been the happiest with the result from the match, phoenix landing certain more than did it's job. \n\nThe draft selection was solid. Your normal irish and euro taps along with other major boston/new england brews on tap as well. \n\nThere was a good crowd for the match. While it wasn't packed to the gills, there were plenty of seats taken and it was a crowd that certainly wanted to watch the match. \n\nIt was a pretty good atmosphere and it did make for fun while watching the match.
