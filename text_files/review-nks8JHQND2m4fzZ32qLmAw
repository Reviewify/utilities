I ordered the general tofu combo & a reallly cheap \"homemade lemonade\" (ha). Tofu was chewy-er than any tofu I've ever had, any didn't have flavor. Rice was rice, not sticky or particularly frsh tasting. Spring roll was the best part (as greasy as it was). The \"homemade\" lemonade was some generic cool-aid-like brand, it was extremely sweet & not refreshing at all. Yuck. So, why 2 stars at all? Well, I don't know, I guess I just don't like being mean, but this was THE worst chinese food I've ever ordered. I don't know if the meat dishes are better, but the tofu was horrible. Plus there were only two broccoli in the whole thing & one of them was uncooked AND tasted really weird. Never trying this spot again. If you're hungry - it will put food in your stomach, but if you have another option - go for that one.", "business_id": "pMRVYn_xcAShV8y71mXMoQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-10", "type": "review"}
