I love the small, quit size of this place which boasts a healthy beer menu and nice drink menu. There were two bar tenders working behind the scenes who kept the drinks full and the smiles all around- the male bartender even got up to sing a song. The Underground karaoke was amazing!  All indie and rock music and a bunch of hipsters getting up to sing!  What could be better in life? The restrooms are clean, along with the decor of the rest of the joint.  I hope to go back!", "business_id": "TRMSNc6MM_YRzT1YnaEmWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-22", "type": "review"}
