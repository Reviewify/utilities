I love the small, quit size of this place which boasts a healthy beer menu and nice drink menu.\nThere were two bar tenders working behind the scenes who kept the drinks full and the smiles all around- the male bartender even got up to sing a song.\nThe Underground karaoke was amazing!  All indie and rock music and a bunch of hipsters getting up to sing!  What could be better in life?\nThe restrooms are clean, along with the decor of the rest of the joint.  I hope to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TRMSNc6MM_YRzT1YnaEmWA"}
