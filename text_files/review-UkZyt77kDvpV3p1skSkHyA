I was slightly disappointed there wasn't a lunch menu with smaller portions, but the food was so good we finished most of it anyways.  I was glad I got there early for lunch hour since there was a huge line when I left!  There were lots of people getting take-out for lunch, which I might try next time when I don't have time for a sit down meal.", "business_id": "7bYE2n75faWu_OjzxD0l0w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-02-21", "type": "review"}
