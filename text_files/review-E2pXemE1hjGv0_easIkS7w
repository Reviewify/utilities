Probably one of the better delivery options via campusfood.\n\nI ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken. I got two large pieces: a wing and a leg. Both were juicy and well seasoned. Plus, I enjoyed the zesty cream sauce that accompanied the chicken. The dinner came with a generous serving of thickly-cut fries and a bit of salad. The fries were a little limp on arrival; maybe they just don't travel well. I also ordered a side of sweet plantains. They were indeed very sweet, which made them seem more like banana slices to me (which is a pity because I really like plantains!).\n\nAll in all, not bad for $15 and a short wait. While I might like La Feria in Shadyside a tad better food-wise, I'm glad that A&J's delivers!\n\n3.5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "dMKrQ13oZHtrkHMSx4EpEQ"}
