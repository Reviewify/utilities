(because the last time i was there before that...there was a snotty worker behind the register and she was such a biatch! - needless to say, she wasn't present yesterday. maybe she got another job which doesn't require her to have any sense of customer service skills whatsoever - like maybe the dmv) anyways... i think there were only 2 people working, but the store was so organized, and clean, and we didn't have much trouble finding what we wanted. and they were both very helpful and friendly. the guy on the floor was very attentive, holding my stuff behind the counter and getting me into a fitting room. (perhaps he didn't want to take the chance that i would steal merchandise... lol) for whatever the reason, i didn't want to walk around the store carrying all that stuff anyway. how i managed to only spend $57 for: a pair of earrings and a pair of boots and a pair flats and 2 tops and a cardigan and a necklace (breath) is beyond me. saving money makes me happy. and i'll be looking cute and stylish to work for the next week. score!", "business_id": "S_4KYDQj0IO6nx1IDxeUng", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-04", "type": "review"}
