I love the diversity in music it brings in, and I love that is (ostensibly) a \"music lovers paradise\". But, with all that comes a somewhat standoffish staff, prices (for everything) that range from high to really high, and a general feeling of \"we will tolerate your presence for as long as we need to and not a second longer\". I can't point to any one particular example, but its a vibe thing. I guess my feelings for the venue somewhat mirror my feelings for WXPN...cool, but not nearly as cool as they would like you think. All that aside, the main room is a great place to see a show, and the sound and sightlines are generally excellent. As others said, take care of your eating/drinking needs beforehand, and you'll have a much better time.", "business_id": "-5Rah4ZvWsDu4oilUZxhtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-11", "type": "review"}
