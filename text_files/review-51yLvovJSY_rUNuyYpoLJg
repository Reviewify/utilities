Though, the lack of reviews should definitely not be a testament to the quality of this particular Bank of America branch. First of all, Sergio R. is totally right about the fact that you CAN. FIND. PARKING. The Village is never bursting to the seams with visitors, so there's ample space within a 1-2 block radius. Not to mention, with 4 ATM stations, people are always coming and going, so a spot will definitely free up before you know it. The employees are especially friendly here, as are most service representatives all throughout the Village (location, location, location, people!). However, I knocked off a star just for the fact that this place is in desperate need of an upgrade.
