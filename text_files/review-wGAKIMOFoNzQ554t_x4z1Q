It is definitely a whole in the wall type place with a look that probably hasn't changed much in 50 years. The bar and tables and chairs are well worn. Despite it's well worn condition the food was great and the service was prompt and friendly. I had the chicken club and it was delicious. I'd eat here again for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CjvV9PzdSOk7gapnwS1Xww"}
