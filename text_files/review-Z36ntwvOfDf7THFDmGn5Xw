We were able to take advantage of the 1/2 off martinis which was an added bonus. I ordered a pomegranate martini which was okay and the spaghetti squash & ricotta ravioli. The ravioli was over cooked and the pasta skin was too chewy. The best part of the meal was the corn, cherry tomato, kale and capers marmalade under the ravioli.We closed the meal by splitting a sorbet trio that was nothing special. Would probably spend my money elsewhere to get a better meal for my buck.", "business_id": "4CXO92H2UsgSI4koZNTBQg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-23", "type": "review"}
