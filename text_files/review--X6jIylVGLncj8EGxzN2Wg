I know it's a bar atmosphere, been to plenty but the wait and attitude of the servers- extremely poor and unprofessional. Don't even try to order drinks, just go to the bar for a little better response time. Used to love going there while at Poly and even now, but never again will I sit at the bar, just order to go or sit outside, the other guests around you will be alot more pleasant that the service at the bar. One experience wouldn't cause me to write a review, it will take a few, and they reached it. I work in hospitality and we should always try to appease the guests, they do contribute to our paychecks, it's apperant that the staff here doesn't or doesn't care about tips either... it's take out from now on or go to somewhere with better serive, they aren't the only ones with great food.", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}
