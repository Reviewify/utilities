I had scallops that were amazing and my boyfriend had the beef filet that was also very, very good.  The view is great- you can see downtown and uptown, depending on where you are seated in the restaurant.  \n\nThis is a very relaxing place to go to every so often- especially if you like looking out at the city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PUATlg41Z_bnmOPWcPBt-A"}
