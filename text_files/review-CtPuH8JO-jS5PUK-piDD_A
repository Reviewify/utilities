It's definitely the best Asian food you'll find on campus! I used to come here 2-3 times a week and never got sick of it! My favorite is the #4 Chicken rice noodle soup. It comes with a decent amount of chicken and lots of veggies and the soup is usually hot enough. They make your noodles when you place the order so that you're able to tell them what you want and don't want in your soup! I usually ask for extra cilantro and jalapenos and they always gladly add it in for me! I haven't gotten their boba in a while because I don't remember it being very good. Some of my friends love their boba though, so you might just have to judge for yourself!", "business_id": "9SJBeXrpiFbeosV4B5cPsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}
