I don't know if it's one of a kind, but it definitely is suited to serve the student community at USC. The main obvious difference from other locations is that they serve light breakfast... build-your-own cereal, oatmeal, and yogurt served all day.  Prices are kinda high (I wouldn't pay $3 for a scoop of Fruitty Pebbles) but I guess it's the premium for convenience. Inside, there is a plenty of seating.. but surprisingly (or not) I see NO outlets anywhere... perhaps it's to keep students from camping out?  Either way it's annoying to me.  The outside patio is the best feature of this store... it's huge (I count at least 25 of those bistro tables), complete with a fountain and firepit.  It's also enclosed by an iron/brick fence, so \"intrusions\" from the sidewalk are minimized. Not much to say about the staff... they were nice and friendly enough to me, and made my drink well.  I find that a lot of times, your own attitude matters just as much as the service staff!", "business_id": "GBQyfkuOWvtOaEG_fGd-ZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-27", "type": "review"}
