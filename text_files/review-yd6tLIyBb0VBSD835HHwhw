I came here for a bikini wax and was out in under 15 minutes (for a brazilian) -- I read Audrey's review below, and wasn't sure I bought it, but it's true!  Yolanta was great.\n\nI want to point out that the map to this location is completely wrong -- the spa is located in the Town & Country shopping center at Embarcadero and El Camino, *not* near downtown, as the map shows.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CEYe2iZoOdsInxU9Mlbjcw"}
