The last couple times, however, I've been disappointed.  My recent visit sealed it for me and I will not dine there again, unless someone else (i.e Vendor) is paying.  My filet was not tender and had tendon-like fat within the filet.  We ordered a side dish of asparagus, and the portion was pathetic.  In the past, they've always been generous.  When we asked, they stated they were decreasing most portions to prepare for the requirement to state calories for each dish.  Hmmm...well...that's OK, as long as they decrease the price as well.  And the wedge salad was also smaller that recent experiences and the dish was not optically pleasing.   I hope that this location, serving a discriminating customer base (Palo Alto) will not follow the corporate direction.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d_IBp5wNVn5wDlNkblAL8w"}
