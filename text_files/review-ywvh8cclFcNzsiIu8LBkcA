I'm not a fan of Five Guys, or really burgers in general, but I ended up finishing my whole meal here. I got the Philadelphia burger which had peppers, provolone, and sauteed onions--the onions were an awesome touch and I loved the peppers. The burger was cooked perfectly and I'm SUPER picky when it comes to how my beef is cooked. The patty was cooked medium and it was perfectly pink and tender on the inside. The only complaint I have about the burger itself is that the buns tasted like they were McDonalds buns... no texture whatsover and were kind of \"smushed\".  What's REALLY to rave about are the sweet potato fries. I hate sweet potatoes, but have a weakness when these are fried. They come served in an adorable mini metal bucket and you get a huge serving for $3. They are lightly sea-salted, not oily at all, and the horseradish honey mustard was AMAZING. It had a spicy kick to it, but was also tangy and ever so slightly sweet. Definitely try the Chipotle Ketchup as well. I also got a dark chocolate milkshake... it was not as thick as I would have liked it to be, but the flavor was great. Not bitter like most dark chocolate, but also not overly sweet.  All in all, it was a great dining experience. The customer service is fantastic, and the dining environment is much classier than the College Park establishments I'm used to. Bobby's Burger Palace is a great addition to Route 1 and the College Park area, and I can't wait to go back and earn more points for my rewards card!", "business_id": "QFcp5kT7eHtbLxRiwiekiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-25", "type": "review"}
