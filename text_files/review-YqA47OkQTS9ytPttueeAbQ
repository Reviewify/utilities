(ps. abita makes root beer?!) however, the ingredients were so fresh and the bread was so good! it was lunch time so they were pretty packed and the only free table inside was looking a little funky with food bits and stickiness. you have to take into account the lunch rush and i couldn't be to hard on them after i had my sammy in hand. overall, the staff was super friendly and the food is great. i'll deal with stickiness here and there for an eggplant and goat cheese sandwich and an abita root beer.", "business_id": "zaFnxGccKKKzVPkVoE0M3Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-06", "type": "review"}
