My friends and I used to walk past it daily when they were working on it, so we decided to give them a try on their opening day. We were pretty much the only customers in the place. It didn't seem like they would stay open through the night, let alone through the end of the year. And look where they are now! Two more locations, and I'm sure they're still looking to expand. And they deserve it. I've never actually had a burger at UBurger since I don't really like burgers, but the hot dogs, fries and frappes are all delicious. The frappes are very filling, so I can never finish my hot dog and fries when I order one. I keep trying though!", "business_id": "PPQgcw0WKdZ6nznkPLgX5Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-07", "type": "review"}
