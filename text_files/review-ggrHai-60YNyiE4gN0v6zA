I love their wings, it's hard to find better wings.  And it's fun to watch games there if you can get there early enough to find a seat.  But I've had numerous bad experiences there.  Once I asked for a refill from the server and twenty minutes later it was not refilled.  When she finally came back, I asked her again and she said \"you know our fountains are right over there\".  My response was \"then what hell is your job?\"  She lost about $10 in tips from my group right there, my tip was $0.01.  Other times I've just gotten snide comments from the servers.  So while I enjoy the food, it can be a frustrating experience.  But hey, if the waiter/waitress treats you bad, at least your meal costs less.", "business_id": "VbP830GPTYFP8_JeXdxriA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-15", "type": "review"}
