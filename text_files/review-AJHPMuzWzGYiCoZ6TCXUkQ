We ordered several medleys of sashimi and sushi.  Yellow tail, tuna and salmon were presented on delicate beds of freshly shredded white and dark radish. The rolls were not overly sauced and the ingredients were very fresh. It was so good!  Our child guest loved the salmon teriyaki box.  And the miso soup was very nice.   I think the highlight was the fast and friendly service!  It was a packed house, but the dishes came out so fast!  I don't know how they did it.  Props to the culinary staff!  It's so refreshing when a restaurant's service and quality are in harmony. We'll definitely return on our next trip back to Pasadena!", "business_id": "v77A8jl3eXfO3UgMC-ydig", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-13", "type": "review"}
