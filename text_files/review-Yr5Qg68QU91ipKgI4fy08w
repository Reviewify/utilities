I had thought to myself.. now why would I want to go to the grand opening when I know the lines would be ridiculously stupid. I have a life.. I'm not going to spend my day waiting in line for cupcakes. S0o.. About a month has gone by.. assuming there wouldn't be a line 1045am on a Friday.. BUT.. I was wrong. BUT it was ridiculously stupid. It was about a 15 minute wait and since I was in the area.. I'm not gonna turn around and go home (it takes me 15 minutes to get home). The girls who were working were nice and very smooth in controlling the line. I've had Sprinkles before (from Newport) and I like the red velvet. I decided to try their chair latte cupcake and I would have to say I surprisingly liked it. It was very Breakfast-y and didn't feel heavy in my stomach. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars because I'm not a huge fan of sweet but it's like a once and a blue moon kind of treat.", "business_id": "roEQNfyPi3jRv3WFFr-f_g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-18", "type": "review"}
