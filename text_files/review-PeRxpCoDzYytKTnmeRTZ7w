Low blood sugar was making me CRANKY! I was kinda buggin' while waiting in line and starting to realize that the weather is turning (I guess it's November). To top it all off my brunch buddy was late, so I had to count to 10 backwards a bunch of times and was finally talked into staying. I am very glad that I did. The food was second to none a lil' bit pricier (not pricey) but everything was made with love and it showed. We split an order of bacon (its a food group you know), chocolate chip pancakes & an awe inspiring seafood omelette. Two large glasses of fresh squeezed o.j. topped it all off. I would definitely come back, just maybe a little bit earlier so I wouldn't have to wait as long. And to the kid with the jar of goup & the smart mouth you got away reeeaaallllyyy lucky lil' buddy, patience is a virtue & it was a Sunday morning... (peace, love, and all of the above)", "type": "review", "business_id": "1eHZYJdIAZJCL2HCb-lPXw"}
