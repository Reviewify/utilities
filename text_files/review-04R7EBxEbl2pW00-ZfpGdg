It's one of three pizza places along the Lancaster Avenue strip and it's probably my least favorite in terms of its pizza. The crust is thin and the last times (I mean the last time I told myself I'd ever get a slice there) it was cold. The inside is nice though and the restaurant itself is well taken care of. Burgers and other sandwiches and such are a good bet to eat and there is a full bar inside and a scanty option of takeout beer. Savas also serves breakfast which is actually decent, but again, expensive. French toast, home fries and fruit... for a price. I personally don't eat much at Savas anymore, but I wouldn't tell someone not to try it.", "business_id": "_xSCB2TZ-s6yTeafRnzK1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-07", "type": "review"}
