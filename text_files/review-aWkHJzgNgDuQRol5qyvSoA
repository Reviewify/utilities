Based off the Yelp recommendations, I ordered the kalbi plate. It was decent, though not the best nor cheapest Korean BBQ I've had before. Maybe I'm a fatso, but I don't think the portions are THAT big... they give you two big scoops of rice, but I ate most of the kalbi in one sitting. Definitely not enough to cover two meals for a guy...maaybe two for a dainty girl. And $10 for kalbi plate is not a steal by any means... Overall, I'd eat here again for lack of better options in Westwood. However, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way. Sidenote: at least for take-out orders, the tax was included in the menu price (so if you are trying to figure out if you have enough cash, the menu prices are an accurate reflection of what you pay total)", "business_id": "g-B5qeJ0V9mTKrM9Ekr7BA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-25", "type": "review"}
