But I absolutely love this place!  I love that the pizza's start at $6.45 and I can add a whole slew of toppings for only a buck each. I love that the staff was so friendly and patient with me as I tried to think up a perfect protein to veggie combination. I love that i can watch my pizza get tossed into an 800 degree wood-burning oven and that by the time I got my drink and utensils, my order was ready. And my wallet loved that I had enough left over pizza for lunch today (i guess my tummy is pretty happy about that too). I don't have a single complaint and for me, that's a big deal.  They're open late and they stay pretty busy, but there always seemed to be a table available. I know this build-your-own meal isn't a new concept, but 800 Degrees has got it down pat.", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-07", "type": "review"}
