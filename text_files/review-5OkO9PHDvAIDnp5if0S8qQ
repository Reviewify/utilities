I've had both the Crunchburger\u2122 and the Philadelphia Burger, Crunchified (I recommend that, it's potato chips!). The only reason I was upset with getting the Crunchburger was that it was so simple. It was still a delicious burger, the sesame seed bun was nice and soft and the perfect size for the burger, it didn't become slop from the burger's ingredients, either. I get my burgers Medium because that's how I like them. However, they are definitely medium. A lot of places will go a bit beyond medium, and these guys tend to go a little under medium, I like it, just beware if you're not looking for too much pink. The Philadelphia Burger was pretty awesome. The large grilled onion was great and the peppers were a nice touch. I got it with Whiz which was deliciously oozy. *note: since my first visit, they are using smaller rings of onion and not the huge one I got at first I've had the onion rings and the fries. They're both good, the fries are GREAT. I didn't like any of their sauces, but plain fries are just fine. The onion rings are HUGE, not my type, so I won't get them again, but they were still good. The shakes are good and thick as well, with extra large straws. I've only had the coconut milkshake because its so good!", "business_id": "csS_UrBujOvjASbX3gLW7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}
