Staff is fast and friendly. Lots of vegetarian options, which I very much appreciate. So glad I live so close to this place! It is an important staple in Central square; the other fast food places in Central are chains like McDonalds or Wendys. Thanks Falafel Palace!", "business_id": "9qCjkJvgnpzOjKLodDEMxw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-24", "type": "review"}
