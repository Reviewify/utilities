Even for the middle of the week, almost every table was filled. Without a reservation, we were able to grab a place at the bar. (Tip: make a reservation before coming here!) Atmosphere: We liked the warmth and intimate feel of the restaurant. The bar was large, so it didn't feel crowded. The bar is not ideal for tall people - there is not much room under the table to fit your legs! My boyfriend had to sit sideways the whole night. Food: The food was tasty, but nothing really special. The salads were fresh and big (note that the beet salad is only beets, apples, and pecans, no greens like I'd expected). The ravioli of the day, a mushroom ravioli with a pork sauce was tasty but a little rich for our tastes. The cioppino had tons of fish and the tomato sauce was flavorful. Service: The waitstaff and bartender were very pleasant and attentive. Overall a decent Italian dinner, but we won't rush to go back.", "business_id": "OTCgRfMMM5QtqffLJzbZeQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-09", "type": "review"}
