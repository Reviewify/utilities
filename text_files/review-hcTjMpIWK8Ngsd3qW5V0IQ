However, the few times I've been here I've NEVER had a dish that i thought was good.  And a couple of them I could barely choke down.  I think it's partly that they don't have very knowledgeable cooks, so the execution is usually sub par.  But it's also partly that whoever dreams up the menu doesn't *really* understand the average human palate, so some of the ideas are bad to begin with.  I would suggest you don't stray far from the basics and stay away from anything that sounds remotely fancy.", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-09", "type": "review"}
