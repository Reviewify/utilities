My girl and I were both not dressed for any place too fancy and we were not interested in drinking too much. Just have a drink, relax, talk together and maybe have conversation with others. The enormous room was looking not so enormous at all with the amount of people that were there that night. All huddled in one area...the dance floor... and of course it had to be near the bar area. Luckily the bartender came over to us and asked us what we wanted to drink. I got the Rosemary Collins and my friend got the babysitter, both were alright. She didn't like hers because she doesn't like rum, but she did finish it. I just wished mine was sweeter. We proceeded to hang out near the entrance cause it was less crowded. We were pushed around a lot by drunk dancers, which sucked, but we did enjoy watching the strange 70's porno being projected on their brick wall. We were giving the characters lines. The crowd was very mixed and so was the music and we did meet some cool guys at the end of the night. If you want to just have a relaxing night by the bar this is not the place to be on a Saturday or Friday night I am assuming. I did like the setting and I do like central square so I would try it out again maybe on a weeknight to see if it is more low key. P.S. you may have to wait in a short line and there is a $5 dollar cover.", "business_id": "_irBz9yudNSlDUVAe9tr5w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-20", "type": "review"}
