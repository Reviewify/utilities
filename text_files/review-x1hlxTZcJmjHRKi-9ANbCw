Let me tell you, it's quite a popular place, and not just with the college students across the street. School hadn't even started yet, so I can imagine this place gets very crowded.\n\nI ordered a #14 (cheese steak) with everything and asked for sauteed onions instead of raw onions. The meat is just two thin slices of steak, rather than the usual chopped or shredded steak. The cheese is melted right on top of the meat. Then it is all folded into the sandwich on top of the mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The bread is toasted and has a nice crunch to it and the middle is soft and fluffy. I got a half size and that was plenty for lunch. \n\nThe place is cash only and everything is to go as there are no seats inside. The guy who made my sandwich was not very friendly at all. In fact he seemed liked he didn't want to be there. Other than that the sandwich tasted great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5G0Vy0N4H6c4eIGxb1JPSQ"}
