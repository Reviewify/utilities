This was despite it being restaurant week. The food was solid and very tasty, though not particularly inspired and fairly small on the portions (I can blame this on it being restaurant week; it was excellent our previous trip there). The Wine Director Kelly was great, came by and joked that it's okay to be a lover of rose and admit it. We had a bottle of the 97 Rioja Rose, which was wonderfully adventurous and unlike any other rose I've ever had. It was a decent pairing with both the bluefish and the ravioli, but worked magic when paired with the blue cheese in our cheese plate.", "business_id": "uj8u2FWO9JQ5z2ouYADWZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-14", "type": "review"}
