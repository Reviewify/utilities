I miss USC tremendously. I had an amazing 4 years here, where I not only was exposed to world-class professors, incredibly unique classes (took a class with Leonard Maltin -- yes, the same class where 'SC students got to watch Lord of the Rings 2 wks before the release and got to meet the Hobbits after the class), but also diverse cultures, and an amazing lineup of extracurricular and leadership activities. I am grateful for my education here as well as for all the opportunities that 'SC provided me. I can't wait to go back for homecoming, and I can't wait for football season! Fight on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BoaMAsCGJVphOJ1Y93QmZw"}
