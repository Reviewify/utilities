A rainy day in Harvard Square.  A little hungry, a good bit wet, and terribly behind on my Psych reading, I decided to duck into anywhere close to me that served food and was somewhat quiet.  I was happy to find a cozy atmoshere with brick walls and friendly smiles behind the counter.  Also, the noise level in this place wasn't bordering on sonic boom so it seemed like a winner.

Thank you Harvard Square Boloco for providing sanctuary from the elements, healthy choices at wallet friendly prices, peace and quiet and that killer chocolate chip cookie that I can't seem to resist most visits.  \n\nI did mention that I sort of became a regular after my first visit, didn't I?", "type": "review", "business_id": "is_3J5wgSNx142iNaNrSHQ"}
