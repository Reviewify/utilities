While this location couldn't be better, the atmosphere is casual and contemporary, and I liked ordering at the counter for lunch--my food was just bleh! My friend and I had the garden harvest salad for $11 and literally had two mushrooms, two slices of roast beets, a couple 2inch pieces of asparagus and a bit of cheese and walnuts. Oh, yes, a handful of spring greens, too. I've had dinner salads that were larger. No protein on the plate, I thought the salad was going to be huge--loaded with the above mentioned veggies. Huge disappointment!! If you go, don't get a salad! The pizza looked as if you would be getting your money's worth!! Try that! I could have really gone for one of the gyros being sold right outside!!", "business_id": "Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-20", "type": "review"}
