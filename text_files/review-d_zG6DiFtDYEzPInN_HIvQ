At first glance the environment seems ideal for any diva: well-lit! friendly waiters! french presses! Large tables designed to promote conversation among divas from multiple houses! But beware: this coffee shop offers meager portions for exorbitant prices.\n\nExpect commoners to laud Society Coffee for its outward appearance, but do not be fooled. Your baked eggs will appear in an espresso cup ($10), your mixed-drink in a wine glass (or something equally inappropriate), and you can expect to wait for your meal (and beg for the check) like a common pedestrian.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fFsEJQB2HhpfXV48ioxzXw"}
