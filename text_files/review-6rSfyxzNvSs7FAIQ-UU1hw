Had a separate tv area. Only problems was that the plumbing seemed a bit old... had to hold down the flusher for the toilet (which was loud as hell) and the shower n sink took a bit to cycle down the water... \n\nI had actually planned my boyfriend's birthday party here so I worked with people at the hotel to make arrangements for the party. It was a bit tough at first to get a response from people but once I did, it was smooth sailing. We had a great time at Escape (their pool event on weekend nights) and then moved over to the Whiskey Blue. Drank a lot and shared our cookie cake (got to love Mrs. Fields) with whoever wanted some. :) \n\nEveryone made it really easy for us once we were there. Check-in was a breeze and the staff was friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg"}
