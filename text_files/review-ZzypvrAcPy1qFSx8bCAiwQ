Being the Costco for elite make up products, the average makeup consumer can often become overwhelmed by the options but the staff at this branch make elite makeup shopping a breeze.\n\nThe associates are attentive, and like many other retail businesses, they approach you and ask if you'd like any assistance.  If you mention that you're browsing, they leave you be with a courteous and sincere, \"Ok, let me know if you need anything.\"  After milling about the place on my own and making no recognizable progress, I approached a representative and asked for their assistance/professional opinion.\n\nWithin a few minutes I had what I was looking for and a few additional products that will enhance my whole beautifying routine.  I expressed my concerns on cost and she found exactly what I needed for a reasonable price and a very distinct description on why I should use one product over the other.  The whole exchange was quite good!\n\nI should also mention that this place is super pooch friendly with water dishes scattered about the store and a staff who is willing to not only pamper the person but the pooch, too.\n\nThank you Sephora Staff of Stanford Shopping Center, keep up the good work.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EfleO7C8gt1_QFHw0b9x-A"}
