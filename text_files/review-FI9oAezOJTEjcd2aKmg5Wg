I have never had Korean BBQ under 15 dollars and this place has amazing prices for their Lunch Special and the portions are really big. The quality of the food is really good also. I ordered the marinated chicken over rice and my GF ordered short ribs over rice. I liked the marinated chicken a lot better but both dishes were good overall. The lunch special also comes with soup and the standard condiments normally offered during Korean BBQ meals.  As for service, yes, the owners are kind of rude but what asian restaurant doesn't have poor service? I'm assuming they just aren't as confident with their English so they don't talk much but when you leave, they greet you out and say bye. Thats enough for me. 5 stars!", "business_id": "we3YxbueOBb0f-m7ekYk2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-29", "type": "review"}
