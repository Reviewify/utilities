The garlic fries were delicious, definitely something I will be craving. The skirt steak was ok, it was medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. I just wish I ordered the Ribeye instead. The chimichurri was really good, I ate it with the bread the steak everything! I also got the Red Sangria that was good it didn't stand out. I like it with more fruits in it. I will definitely comeback to try the ribeye. Also it tends to get kind of loud inside!", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-28", "type": "review"}
