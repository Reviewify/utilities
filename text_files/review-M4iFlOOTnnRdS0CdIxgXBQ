Someone had the incredible idea of combining an asian buffet and a food truck, and the result is Net Appetit. You walk inside, grab one of those beige recyclable boxes found everywhere on campus, and you go to town. You can get brown rice, white rice, fried rice, or noodles. After that, grab some meat. I would highly recommend the chicken tandoori murghi, the chicken red thai curry, and the beef bulgogi. Further down, there are some more curries as well as some paneer, potstickers, and eggrolls. After finally deciding what you want to eat, you take it outside to get it measured. I think it's about $5 per pound. Soda (Coke,  Diet Coke and Spite) is 50 cents a can. The only downside to Net Appetit is that the number of offerings decrease as lunchtime wanes. I would suggest going between 11:30 and 12:30. Overall, a great quick place to eat on campus that won't break the bank.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EUhH6r8AJz5XFLE-ZBrALg"}
