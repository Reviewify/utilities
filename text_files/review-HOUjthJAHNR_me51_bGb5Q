Last night my cousin celebrated her 40th birthday at her house.  She decided to have Bistro 45 cater---usually even the largest family event has home-cooked food all over it.  Anywho, I have to say that almost all their hors d'ovres (?) were really tasty.  There was one cheese and mushroom tart I didn't care for, but everything else I sampled was delicious. For example:\n\nAhi tuna on a thin rice cracker with avocado, wasabi, and caviar\nCrostini with beef and garlic aioli\nLamb lolipops with a yogurt sauce\nPork dumplings with a sesame dipping sauce\n\nThere was more, it was all pretty darn delicious!  And I loved the servers.  They were super friendly and very attentive.  Five minutes wouldn't go by without something being passed.  And I think they knew my cousins and I would never turn something down, 'cause they always passed right by us.  \n\nI have no clue what the cost is, so I don't know if I could recommend them to someone without budget info, but if you are going to a party and Bistro 45 is catering, chances are good that you'll be enjoying the yumminess.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MJMTsZ0ty0RCyUjF_6XVPg"}
