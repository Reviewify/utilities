Last night my cousin celebrated her 40th birthday at her house. She decided to have Bistro 45 cater---usually even the largest family event has home-cooked food all over it. Anywho, I have to say that almost all their hors d'ovres (?) were really tasty. There was one cheese and mushroom tart I didn't care for, but everything else I sampled was delicious. For example: Ahi tuna on a thin rice cracker with avocado, wasabi, and caviar Crostini with beef and garlic aioli Lamb lolipops with a yogurt sauce Pork dumplings with a sesame dipping sauce There was more, it was all pretty darn delicious! And I loved the servers. They were super friendly and very attentive. Five minutes wouldn't go by without something being passed. And I think they knew my cousins and I would never turn something down, 'cause they always passed right by us. I have no clue what the cost is, so I don't know if I could recommend them to someone without budget info, but if you are going to a party and Bistro 45 is catering, chances are good that you'll be enjoying the yumminess.", "business_id": "MJMTsZ0ty0RCyUjF_6XVPg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-07", "type": "review"}
