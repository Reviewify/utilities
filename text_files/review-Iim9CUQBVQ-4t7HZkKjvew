I have yet to find \"MY\" hairstylist.. that's why I keep trying different hair salons EVERYWHERE. But, being a Pasadena local, I've found myself returning to Salon Aguayo, not for anyone in particular.. But, for the environment/service. I love the treatment they all provide you with.. very professional and makes you feel super comfortable. Good place to go for hair cuts or hair styling. The salon itself has really great style and it's always a good day after leaving their company. Will go back FOR SURE.", "business_id": "kb0hDYZQ_KmpxhNDL32PxA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-29", "type": "review"}
