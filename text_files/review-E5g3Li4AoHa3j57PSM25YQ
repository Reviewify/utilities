This is a quick-stop outpost in an apartment building, NOT a sit-down fine-dining Japanese establishment.  Give Soy a break.  Soy is great for what it is supposed to be.  The rolls are very generous in size and they have unique options like white tuna and lobster rolls.  The spicy sashimi salad is my favorite.  It is fresh, tasty, and very well priced.  The prices are reasonable especially for the portion size.  The calamari is a bit bland, but the sauces they offer add some flavor. The food can take a while to come out, especially when they are busy, but it is overall a good option when you need decent, affordable, filling sushi.", "business_id": "37Va6ESAdLWYUtcZ5-DaAA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-16", "type": "review"}
