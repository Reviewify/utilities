Reasonable price and portion but the food isn't anything to write home about. Portions are filling but I found the flavor of the chicken and broccoli to be a bit bland. Stay away from the bubble tea though, very very bad but the smoothies are drinkable. Sushi here is OK but with Sushi Boat two doors down I wouldn't recommend it. There are not many tables so the place is commonly full.", "business_id": "ATnRWnNk5iwwIbwS8VmuKg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-16", "type": "review"}
