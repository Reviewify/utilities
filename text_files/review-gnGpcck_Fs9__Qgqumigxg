It is definitely not on any of my \"recommended\" lists because the food is so average. The people who work there are nice, but the food is uninspiring. The only time I really ever go to Boloco is if someone else wants to eat there, in which case I can eat the food but I know to go in with low expectations. The Mediterranean chicken burrito is okay, as is the chicken teriyaki. There's something about the smell of Boloco that I find mildly gross; i think that it's a clean place, but still, something weirds me out about the smell. The smoothies are okay, but I have ordered some that are closer to juice because they are so thin. I'm not positive how Boloco really stays open because it seems that there are multiple places in the Square that people would go to first.", "business_id": "is_3J5wgSNx142iNaNrSHQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-18", "type": "review"}
