Cheap and delicious. I went all the time when I was a UCLA undergrad and I still go back every chance I get. An ice cream sandwich is only $1.50 (2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream) and a diddy dozen is only $3.75. Great deal! The sandwich used to be only $1 when I was an undergrad, then it crept up to $1.25 and now $1.50. Guess you gotta keep up with economy. Still a good deal though.\n\nThey have so many types of cookies to choose from but I find myself always getting the same 3 kinds - chocolate chip, white chocolate chip macadamia, and oatmeal raisin (my mom's fav). However, all of them are very good and very fresh.\n\nLines can get extremely long, but since I'm not in the area often, it's worth the wait. Parking is pretty much along the street, but if you plan to spend more time in Westwood (ie. dinner, movie etc), I would suggest parking in the structure on Broxton. I believe it's only $3 after 6pm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
