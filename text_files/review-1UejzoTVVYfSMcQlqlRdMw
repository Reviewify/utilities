It's been at the top of my Indian list for years and I LOVE the place! I do love the food here immensely! The Butter Chicken is fantastic! The nan is usually quite a portion and we always order a couple, plain and garlic. My fave dish, though, is the Coconut Curry with chicken! Yum-o! The chai here is also pretty freakin' fantastic and they'll keep filling it for you all night long (unless it's a packed house). I love the baklava that they bring out with the bill! This place is a good place for a casual, yet still nice date or for groups! On the unfortunate side, when it is packed is a terrible time to go! I mean TERRIBLE!! It's not that the food goes down in quality, but you can be sitting around waiting for more service for a LONG time. It's understandable and it can get ridiculously busy, especially on a Friday evening, but it can be aggrevating if you aren't interested in waiting for the food. I always think it's worth the wait, but still try to avoid \"rush hour\". Unfortunately, they've missed the baklava that used to always be brought out with the bill a couple of times in the more recent history. Unfortunate especially because it's a great ending! We just had to order it then. Lastly, and also quite unfortunate, is the parking situation. Ever since that Walgreens moved in next to it, The Cedars' parking has been pushed across the street to Safeway's lot and there is little available parking there. If you're lucky you'll find a spot in there or right on Brooklyn, but if you're smart you'll walk or bus over!", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-23", "type": "review"}
