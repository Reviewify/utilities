That said, the food is tasty, but the portions always leave me feeling somewhat unfulfilled, so I'm glad I've never tried to get food here during non-happy hour. The good news is that non-happy hour only lasts from 7-9pm, so chances are you'll get some cheap eats whenever you show up. This applies extra on Sunday when a variety of menu items can be had for a buck. A buck! As a footnote, there is a supreme court case entitled \"Larkin v. Grendel's Den\" [459 U.S. 116 (1982)]. A little slice of history for the other legally-minded nerds out there.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 3, "date": "2006-05-17", "type": "review"}
