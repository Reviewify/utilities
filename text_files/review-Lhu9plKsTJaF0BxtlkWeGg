I'll get to those later and I even have pictures! The fairy doors are outside but you can look into the windows and see the little fairy homes and how they live inside of their small little abode!\n  This place is just about as small town \"cute\" as it can be! There is so much to look at and it is a feast for the eyes! If you want stickers, they have stickers! If you are looking for something cute and \"quirky\" for a friend, they'll have that too! What I like is that they have alot of \"Hello Kitty\" things to choose from and my daughter and I love \"Hello Kitty\". Also, I am a \"chemo-angel\" and I send small gifts to people suffering from cancer. They have many stickers for me to decorate the packages that I mail out and they have stickers that are cute and unusual that I can also send to some of the sick children. They even give me a cute little red and gold envelope to put the stickers in for when I send them out to people!\n   There is a great book in this store and it explains all about Ann Arbor, Michigan and the \"fairy doors\" here. The book is full of stories and nostalgia along with many pictures of all the different fairy houses and their locations in Ann arbor; also a map is included.\n   I can go to this little \"country\" /\"town\" store every Sunday when we do our Ann Arbor \"family day\" out. I never get tired of going there and they always have alot of stuff that you 'll never find anyplace else! Very unique I guess I would say!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JCZa_BfNfu3K-Yvf3a4ozA"}
