The menu at Emma's sets itself apart from the competition by offering stellar gourmet pizzas. They also have a nice selection of salads and sandwiches.\n\nTheir charming, intimate dinning space only seats about three dozen people. The wait for a table can be anywhere from 10 minutes to one hour. Emma's also has a carry-out window for folks who would rather take their pizza to go than withstand the sometimes epic wait.\n\nOnce seated, you have to decided between twenty-five rich combinations of wafer-thin crust pizzas. As a vegetarian, I enjoy #13 (artichoke hearts, house roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, and ricotta), #23 (baby spinach, olives, feta, garlic olive oil, and mozzarella), and #9 (thyme roasted mushrooms, baby spinach, garlic, feta, and mozzarella). But if that's not how you roll, they also have meaty options with grilled chicken, crispy smoked bacon, and the like.\n\nEmma's is a nice spot to eat after a trip to the nearby Garment District or the Kendall Square movie theater; it would be better if they were open later, and it's a little pricey for pizza. The food is imaginative, sometimes bizarre, but always delicious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7bYE2n75faWu_OjzxD0l0w"}
