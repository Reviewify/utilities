I mean that as in I don't leave Boston until I've been there. Black ink is, in my opinion, for stationery lovers. They have all sorts of nice pens and unique office supplies, novelty mugs and lunch boxes. My item of choice here are the Green 100% and APICA notebooks from Japan. They're the only store I've ever found that has an abundance regularly available at a reasonable price. Pick one up when you go. Any other notebook will pale in comparison. Really though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d6asV_ziLv0SpOUEy9BWmg"}
