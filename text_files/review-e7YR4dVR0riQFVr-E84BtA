I had the Blue Shroom Burger and tater tots. The burger was huge and outstanding and the tater tots were hot and crispy. There was so much I took half home. To appreciate the place, reading their menu from cover to cover is a must. Hilarious. The website would lead you to believe that the waitresses might be a \"Hooters\" type of biker chick, but other than being very interesting looking, I didn't find the Hooters factor to be true. \n\nIf you want to go somewhere for a change, I suggest The Vortex.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z2qMwUhnGt_2pA9uQbS7Uw"}
