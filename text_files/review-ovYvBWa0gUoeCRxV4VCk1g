Finally here in the Capital City. For ages I have heard tales of this place. Mostly friends from out west talking about how great this franchise is. Is it good. Yes. Is it all that? No so much.\n\nFrozen yogurt (froyo) seems to be the latest food trend with stores popping up everywhere. Can't blame them as the stuff is delicious and some will even claim it to be good because it's \"probiotic.\"  All those places are trying to aspire to become the original, the one that started it all - Pinkberry.\n\nHere's the problem. Pinkberry has apparently not evolved from when it began. Others have improved on the Pinkberry formula, taking it up a notch. \n\nPinkberry has the standard yogurt (or yogit since we're in RI) flavors - chocolate and some fruit. Unfortunately, it's served by the staff behind the counter. The customization element of pouring your own cup and deciding how much you want is absent. Even worse, the toppings, the most fun part of the experience is lost here. Toppings are poured on by staff once you tell them what you want. This can get extremely agonizing when you have someone with two kids that don't know what they want and hold up the line.\n\nWhile the product is great, the experience isn't. Other places have evolved to offer self serve and personal topping customization. This place is content to do things the old way.\n\nPinkberry may no longer be the best thing since sliced bread, but it's still pretty good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xvb-6QQdvCePXl4GV56_Sw"}
