Creekside did not dissapoint!  The bar downstairs was small and cozy with just a few others there.   Bartender Jimmy was very Friendly and knowledgeable and had an air of kindness and hospitality to him that made us feel very comfortable.  We will definitely make this a stop on future travels!", "business_id": "-4ppieQivAHq4flJXwqy0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-31", "type": "review"}
