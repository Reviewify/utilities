Train station food usually sucks, but this place is really good and it's your only choice. I got a tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich and it was made fresh in front of me. The bakery items are good too. Every table was full around me and I kept hearing people comment on how delicious their food was. The people are nice and it passes the time until your train, shuttle, or ride comes. *Cash only", "type": "review", "business_id": "WNjgfcndwa3h4bc4hc-Y4Q"}
