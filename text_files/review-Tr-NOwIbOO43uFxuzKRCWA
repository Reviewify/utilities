Obviously it was because of DD&D.So finding the place was kind of hard since I didnt know the roads that well. Once getting here I have to agree that it looks like its in a weird place or at least an old town of the area. Park in the back and go in. Nice interior, very homely feel, and they were showing the world cup which is always nice. So because I've never been here we decide to order a bundle. We order the lasagna, the buffalo chicken wings (full), a reuben sandwich, and onion rings. The lady was nice and friendly brought out some waters for my sis, cousin, and me. The wait was a while for the food but im sure everythings fresh and not just sitting there waiting. The wings looked nice, the reuben was big portioned, and my lasagna was out of this world in size. Just looking at it almost gave me acid reflux lol. The food was good nonetheless. The truth is I would probably give this place 4 stars but I wasnt too impressed with the taste. The portions were huge, the prices were great, but I just felt something was missing from the taste. Dont get me wrong, this place would be a massive frequent if i lived in the area because of the menu and prices, but from my visit, i would give it 3.5 stars. Once i go back and try some other dishes I would gladly revise my rating.", "business_id": "hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-29", "type": "review"}
