I'm obsessed with their peach tea and probably need an IV drip set up of either that or their raspberry truffle (milk, chocolate, raspberry syrup, espresso--yes, please). The crepes are also quite tasty. Have never had their gelato or their pastries, though they look enticing. My only issue with Greyhouse is their somewhat slow service. What you get is worth the wait, definitely, but if you're in a rush you probably should just get coffee or save your Greyhouse run for later.", "business_id": "7mNfoXkVmgcWsbSITtEDUQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-24", "type": "review"}
