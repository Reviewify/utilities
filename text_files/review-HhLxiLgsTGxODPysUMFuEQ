We were seated for lunch well before the shift between lunch and dinner prices, and not only did it take more than an hour for our undercooked and cold food to get to us, they saw it fit to charge us the dinner price which is more than twice the lunch price.  We talked to the manager, and she told us that we needed to pay the dinner price even though we had been seated long before the shift.\n\nPerhaps they have new management/policies now, but this was really lame.  I am never going back there.\n\nGo to Wagamama. They are nice and great and good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0GAAtSRsnX3qFBMMszccGw"}
