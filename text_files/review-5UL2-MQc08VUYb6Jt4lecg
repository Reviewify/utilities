So I decided to get the same for lunch today. I vaguely remembered that sandwich from previous time, so was expecting avacado, tomato, lettuce, and cheese (a nice thick slice). When I got my order, I see there is no cheese. I thought for few minutes if this is the same sandwich I had first time, I wasn't 100% sure. So when I came back to look on Ike's website at home, I see the picture. Picture had thick slice of cheese with other goodies ! I am so disappointed right now, because my expectations were clearly not met. I think cheese made the sandwich awesome the first time. How can you forget the most important ingredient?\nAnyways, next time I am going to place my order after looking at the picture online.. they don't serve what they tell.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GqFwgMpqggQgYTco0AbEAg"}
