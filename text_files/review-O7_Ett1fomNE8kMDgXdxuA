I'm happy she took me here though because the food was fresh and delicious! We were starving after driving in from Vegas. Initially I thought that the space was kind of small, but then I realized that they had additional seating in the building next door. That was pretty sweet since we wanted to dine in. We split a few things - the sweet potato fries, portobello and sausage burger, and the chicken run ranch burger. Burgers are hard to split between three people but we made it work. We also tried the watermelon drink, which was so refreshing! And they offered free refills! I caved in and bought a dessert - the peanut butter parfait. It was amazing. I'd come here again if I lived in the area.", "business_id": "gcf4bQVbiOqglEmYBfbpwQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-07", "type": "review"}
