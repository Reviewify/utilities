I guess I was spoiled by Fresca in San Francisco and had high expectations. But I still really enjoyed it here. It's more hearty, country, and rustic in execution, and I liked it. The decor is a bit bright and plain (aside from the gift shop flair), but the food is nice. Expect more of a very basic cafe type of place if you visit.", "business_id": "l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}
