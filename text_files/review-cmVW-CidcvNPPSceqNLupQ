These are the things that you should know, apart from the food is really bad. I always walk by and no one is EVER there! They have an Asian lady taking your order but the cooks are freakin Indian, not even Mexican!? Prices are cheap, but I'd rather go hungry. I ordered a vegetarian pad thai, no freakin sauce!? It was horrible. I had the Kung Pao chicken, it was OK. Ultimately this is a last resort place. If your taste buds are, how shall I say it, \" under the influence\", then it really doesn't matter does it, the prices will lure you, but avoid at all cost!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0eF5c27WkOV2MGLMuAwCWw"}
