Ordered california benedict (good) and 3-egg scramble (ok), and 2 items from the kids menu.  The server noticed that we didn't really touch the kids pasta and took it off the bill.\n\nNot likely to become regulars, but not a bad option for an occasional change of pace from Hobies or Stacks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kAZ1CDYB1W2bZMaQCcoN2g"}
