Very family friendly, good service, food was decent, and prices reasonable.  Ordered california benedict (good) and 3-egg scramble (ok), and 2 items from the kids menu.  The server noticed that we didn't really touch the kids pasta and took it off the bill. Not likely to become regulars, but not a bad option for an occasional change of pace from Hobies or Stacks.", "business_id": "kAZ1CDYB1W2bZMaQCcoN2g", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-22", "type": "review"}
