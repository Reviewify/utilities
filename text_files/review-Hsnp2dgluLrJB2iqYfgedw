Lafayette landscape. I love Korean food and Green Sprout delivers some awesome staples at a decent price. \n\nThe Good:\n- Bibimbop. Although I am a major fan of the Bibimbop in a hot stone bowl, this dish did not disappoint. Large serving size, great mix of rice and veggies and meat, and awesome Bibimbop sauce.\n- Sushi Salad. Fresh and lovely.\n- Customer Service. They will give you pretty much whatever you ask for. They mention the specials and don't seem to be out to gouge you. They are always friendly.\n- Water. They always have cups out and available, you don't have to ask for them. A small perk, but very much appreciated.\n- Location. Convenient to Purdue campus, but near a parking garage so not impossible to find parking. Also close to Red Mango for dessert :)\n- Menu. Lots of delicious Korean staples.\n- Triangle rice: Yum!\n- Atmosphere. Comfortable, easy to relax in, they don't pressure you to leave your table so you can sit and do homework or read a book. \n\nThe Not So Good:\n- Baked goods... I'm sure they are delicious, if they ever had any left by the time I get in! I think that's a sign they must be good because they are always gone.\n- The format: Green Sprout recently switched to more of a sit-down restaurant style. I am not a fan... it is confusing to me to not have the menu up and for me to just go up and order at the counter. The food doesn't seem to fit the sit down style, and while you still can order at the counter I found the switch confusing and somewhat frustrating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aJ1iMCVwG-FNzqaGb3g8LQ"}
