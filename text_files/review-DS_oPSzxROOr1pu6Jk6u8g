I used to think it was kind of mediocre food, but having this place close to home and frequenting it often when I need a quick sandwich, some pancakes, heck, some bacon, I think Amy's Place is the kind of \"mama's little kitchen\" I need in my life. If you're eating lunch, get the CHICKEN SALAD sandwich. It is SO homestyle, I crave it all the time. If you're eating breakfast, chocolate chip blueberry pancakes!!!! The benefit of having Amy around is she cooks things custom made, right in front of you when its ordered. Amy, our first date didn't knock my socks off. But I think we might get married someday. :)", "business_id": "w3p6mz0m1b-jPm26weDabQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-09", "type": "review"}
