I think it's pretty sweet having more than half your menu consist of alcohol. Anyway, I originally was told this restaurant is a tapas place; however, the waitress told me to not refer to their dishes as tapas because their dishes are larger. Go for the lamb and the skirt steak. Both are delicious!!!! I also enjoy the Gratin dish. I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves to try everything. This is a international restaurant and they cook each dish accordingly to their country roots.", "business_id": "C7FKNwSUlbUinT9cRSLXHA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}
