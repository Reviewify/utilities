Busy, but not too loud or at all rowdy on a Friday night (still early). My party of 4 sat in the first table in the corner so I didn't see too much of the actual space, but I liked what I saw of the dim lighting, green and brown decor, and the silhouetted customers at the bar. The drink menu is selective, reasonably priced, and not overwhelming - with a good number of cocktails that aren't too girly. I had a Phipp's Fizz that made my heart (and my boyfriend) smile. Though we were craving something more substantial and bar-foody (like a plate of potato skins perhaps), the food is way more precious than that. Sticking to our budget that night, we also stuck with the \"snack\" menu and had the Fry of the Day (good but tiny) and the Chips and Dip (housemade potato chips and dip). Everything from the cocktails to the dip was really fresh and didn't disappoint in flavor. I would love to go back to get a fuller experience of the place (now that I know what to expect) and hopefully give it another star. \n\nThe one thing that really bugged me was the water! Though our glasses were frequently filled, there was no ice. I take issue with that. But perhaps not everyone feels as strongly about ice as I do. \n\nThe table service and settings were also a little odd and our server dropped the check less than a minute after a different server had brought us more drinks. They were a little confused.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JdWplSS3RfBFamm4FshtcA"}
