Boba Loca is not extraordinarily special, but it's pretty awesome. \n\nI'm no longer a fan of Volcano's since they jacked up the prices & the ladies there are rude. The atmosphere is abit too Asian for me. Yea, I'm Asian so if I'm sick of my own race, that should tell you something... jkjk!\n\nThe milk teas are pretty good. You can't compare Boba Loca's to Half & Half. \n\nI usually get the Almond Milk tea, which is amazing. Thai Milk Tea & Passion Fruit are also pretty good. The rest, I feel are so-so. I heard their coffee is pretty good, I shall try that next.\n\nI haven't studied here. But usually, boba loca is packed with ppl working & Studying. I guess it's a good study place. lol. There's free wifi.\n\nPretty convenient location for UCLA students! I like to play ball & get boba afterwards to reward myself for a good workout... ehhh. The boba prolly cancels out my workout... Oh well! Boba is awesome!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fmM-FUmWXrPcCI1HJu32WA"}
