The $20 Prix Fixe is 100% the way to go, too. My baked pear app was deliciously filling and my friends loved the duck leg entree. It is true that there's only space for one big group reservation, but this is a great addition to the neighborhood. The one waiter is friendly and will get to you when he has a minute. If you're not in a hurry, this is a really great date spot. You can use this quirkily decorated, ceiling fan-cooled, good food-producing place to immediately tell if s/he will roll with spontaneity or will be a high-maintenance stickler unworthy of date #2.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xGos8tSzLwO3J8mEk3z_2A"}
