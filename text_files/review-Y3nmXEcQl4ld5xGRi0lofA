They had great, premium ice cream with special blend-ins long before it was in vogue in other parts of the country. Back then, the main competitor was Steve's Ice Cream and their smash-ins...the blend-ins are far superior since it is done by a machine and results in a more uniform product. Now the smash-in idea has been co-opted by Cold Stone Creamery, but their product is far inferior...their ice cream is very rich, but very bland. I feel sorry for the poor kids behind the counter that have to mix everything by hand!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DvPpIShdybod4x0n5wvKFg"}
