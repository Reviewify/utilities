I really have trouble making myself order something other than the special (everything) fried rice... but I've sampled from friends and so far everything always tastes great!\n\nYou order at the counter and they give you a number to take to your table.  They then bring out your food when it's ready.  There are specials on the colum (it's got a chalkboard) so check those out too. \n\nThe owner I believe is the chef and he's always really nice.  It's great that there is some parking in the back and you'd really want to notice it or you might pass it.  \n\nI haven't really looked to see if they delivered or what their area is because I always worked and lived further from them.  Now that I do, I'll have to make note.  \n\nI'm giving it 5 \"You're gonna crave this food\" stars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cHnEZ6-BeQRlxFiF--sBcA"}
