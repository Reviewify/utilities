I got the spinach artichoke dip (shared it with three others), ordered the fish and chips and then had a mousse for dessert. The portions are big and the food tastes very fresh. Despite being busy, our waitress was very attentive, had a great sense of humor and brought our food quickly.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the place could use some renovation. We were seated at a far corner of the restaurant and there were holes in the wall and the paint was peeling of at certain points. Apart from that, the atmosphere is pleasant and it is a good place to have good Irish beer and food and chat with friends.", "business_id": "Hc3d_UDV7qE30o6WeQBEmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-16", "type": "review"}
