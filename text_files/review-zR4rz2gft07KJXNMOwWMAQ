As of now this stays. I have been craving a Noah's Bagel (for my west coasters out there) for days. I had heard that there was a mouth watering bagel shop not too far from me, so I did a google search and up popped Absolute bagels with stellar review after stellar review. So I grabbed my coat, stood in the cold with my boyfriend and waited for a bus. Him: Is this bagel that serious for us to stand out here? Me: YES! The real answer: uhm, not really. Perhaps my palette is not as refined as others to tell the difference btwn this bagel and others, but my plain bagel with strawberry cream cheese was nothing that I haven't had before. It was crisp on the outside, chewy in the center...which is what it should be! Unless your bagel is stale or store bought, this tasted the same as any other bagel shop fare. Where I was really disappointed is the fact that my plain bagel wreaked of onion (either from it being placed next to the onion bagels or the woman used the onion cream cheese knife to put on my strawberry cream cheese). Speaking of cream cheese, GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY, there was so much of it oozing out I had to scrape it off onto the brown paper bag. But the killer really was the onion taste. Ick. Since I try to keep an open mind, I will give this place one more try but this experience left me feeling underwhelmed.", "business_id": "JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-07", "type": "review"}
