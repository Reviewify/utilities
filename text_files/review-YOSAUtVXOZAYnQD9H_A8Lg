First off, I know that Joe's Crab Shack is like the Denny's of seafood and I wasn't expecting too much, but at least three of the people in our group got food that was near inedible.  Next off, the service was horrible.  The place wasn't even half full and we waited over an hour to get our food.  One of my friends' orders was lost entirely and he didn't receive his food until after everyone else had finished.  Though I will say my meal was good, using Old Bay seasoning as a selling point seems pretty ridiculous, especially considering you can get it at almost any grocery store.  Drinks came incredibly slowly, if at all, and I personally never got the drinks I ordered, always the wrong drink.  When we complained to the manager she had the gall to yell at us.  It was a horrible dining experience and I don't plan to ever go to Joe's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zve6yzrL4qPiQ8eXJn49xg"}
