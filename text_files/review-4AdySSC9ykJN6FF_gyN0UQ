My buddy and I decided to try Ikes place Stanford. This place is very hard to find if you aren't familar with Stanford. My friend and I walked around about for 15-30 minutes till we asked one of the workers where Ikes was. Once we found it we were happy. This location is better then other ikes, because you can sit down and there are couches. I got the Menage a trois which was reallly good. Ikes can be expensive but I think it's worth it.", "business_id": "GqFwgMpqggQgYTco0AbEAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-06", "type": "review"}
