The sandwiches are also good and the staff is friendly.  On the weekend, I would also go to Julie's in the morning for breakfast.  I remember one time getting a nonfat muffin and juice for a nice, older homeless guy that use to always sit by the trash can on the corner of Telegraph and wish a good morning.   He seemed less that impressed that the muffin was nonfat but I'm sure he enjoyed it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X_F53ZyIQT3Y2iSvWRLXEQ"}
