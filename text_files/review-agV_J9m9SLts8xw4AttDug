Chinese food place.  I grew fond of the no frills dining experience there and was saddened to learn a few months ago that it had closed shop.\n\nNoodle Nation is the new establishment that is now occupying that spot.  The girlfriend and I stopped in the other day based on recommendations from a few friends.  The place is small but doesn't feel cramped and is clean, welcoming.  They serve noodles of all types, dry noodles, noodle soups, pan fried, stir fried etc.\n\nWe weren't sure what to get so we asked our server and he suggested the Kauy Jaab and Boat Noodles.  We took our soups with 2 and 3 stars of spiciness and a side of chicken wings to boot.  The server was very helpful in making suggestions and was genuinely efficient/helpful and friendly.  He was never hovering but was available with extra napkins, water etc when needed.  Really appreciated the balance!\n\nThe food itself was great - I don't have anything to compare but both our noodle broth soups were delicious, with great flavoring and generous portions.  My Kuay Jaab had rolled up wide rice noodles with pork and eggs, tofu and garlic.  It totally hit the spot and I'll be eagerly looking to come back and try out more dishes in the future.\n\nPlus that they're open relatively late (1:30 am) for all those undergrads who need a good noodle house after drinking...!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gPPIvynVCnKsvADSgszAqg"}
