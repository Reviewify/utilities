It's right on the edge of Harlem across from an interesting high rise housing project. The place is quaint and the conversations are plentiful on a Saturday morning. The turkey sausage were great and the grits were even better.  I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood and looking for a nice place to try out.", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-24", "type": "review"}
