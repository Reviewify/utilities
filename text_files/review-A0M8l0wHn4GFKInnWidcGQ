Apart from the fact that they used to have big comfy chairs that you could sit in and read, it still has the best selection of books in this university town on the central coast. \n I used to live a few blocks away from the Barnes and Noble's mother ship on Broadway in New York City.  There weren't many other retail stores in that neighborhood near the Flatiron building then, and Barnes and Noble was always good for a rainy or snowy afternoon.\nThis store in San Luis retains that comfy feeling with a Starbuck's located inside with a long bench and tables, which overlooks the courtyard of the downtown center.  It's a good place to meet a friend for coffee and watch the shoppers go by.  \nThey will order almost anything you need.  They also have a discount club, which makes purchases more affordable.  The travel section is good, and the art and history books are fascinating.  There is a discount section up front that features overruns.  They also have great calendars, diaries and cards.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ccHd7quWbSiP4U6BFJtv6g"}
