Their bread is delicately toasted, the beef is juicy and cooked medium rare just how i like it, there's finely sliced sauted onions on top of the meat, and the sweet potato fries were to awesome as well. I'm getting hungry just thinking about last night's dinner! My friend and I split the Kobe sliders and each had our own dinner salad, and a margarita each.  The total came to 25 with tax and tip.  It was a little pricey, but the servers were really friendly and I liked the ambiance there.", "business_id": "Dh3X5NuzAcFZSSl72a5lWg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-07", "type": "review"}
