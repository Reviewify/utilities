As the cut-out letters strung across the bar so aptly exclaim, \"F*** Yeah\". Indeed. Zog's is what all \"dive bars\" should strive to be. Free of sticky floors and sketchy folks, the place offers creative cocktails that are actually really cheap (a rarity for downtown Chapel Hill), two pool tables, and free popcorn. I'm not usually a huge popcorn person, but man! It's good! Totally worth the annoying little kernels that get stuck in-between your teeth. To top it all off, the bartenders and owner are super-friendly. Zog's is free of pretensions and affectation-- it's just plain, good-ole, low-key fun. It's worth it just to sit and read all of the clever, witty signs, quite frankly. Oh, and they have a craft basket. How cool is that?!", "business_id": "0AuFYe6Ia-FQ1vXwS5gshQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-24", "type": "review"}
