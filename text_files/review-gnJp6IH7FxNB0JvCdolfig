It was around 5:30 pm and the place was far from crowded. We sat at the bar and drank a few Dog Fishers or Fisher Dogs, I can't remember, but they were tasty! Toot and I got some Fish and Chips and we both agreed=delicious! The fish had a nice crisp coating and was real moist without being greasy. The Chips were really just Steak Fries but were perfect! Chap grabbed a burger and said it was OK but he got regular fries and was jealous of our \"Chips\". The bartkeeps were attentive as well they should be with only 4 other people sitting at the bar. We watched the Giants-Washington (I refuse to call them by their name as it's totally offensive ) game and it was a little weird because Chap is a huge Giants fan and when they made a big play he'd be shouting and clapping but the rest of the bar was silent. We drew some looks but f' em if they can't take a joke. All in all we liked the place and will probably return before the next show. Two beers and a Bacardi & diet for around $11, great \"pub ambiance\", football, great chow, what's not to like?", "type": "review", "business_id": "_PvljXZHQlUmL8SuOXF8ug"}
