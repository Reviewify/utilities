I recently joined The Phipps because I am always impressed with the exhibits and my visit always puts me in a good mood. I've been at the Phipps in all seasons and attended a couple of the special events (New Year's Eve and Chihuly exhibit). Always something interesting to see. No reasonably priced postcards. That is a real shame.", "business_id": "j83FLfnjvSHw-vrCNHuTCg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-10-28", "type": "review"}
