Came to Adagia for a pre-Greek dinner before seeing the amazing DAVID BYRNE Walk into an extremely pleasant & richly assembled wooden room - reminds me of a posh Country Club Staff is super friendly & while our server was helping a multitude of tables, we felt well-attended Started out w/ the Bistro Bites & Nectarine Salad for the table  Bistro Bites - Sheep Cheese drizzled in Honey, fresh olives, marinated Zucchini & Mushroom Pate on crusty bread  Nectarine Salad was awesome w/ the sweet fruit & crunchy almonds in a light vinaigrette  Both got the Goat Cheese Crostada. Sis loved it to no end & I thought it was very good.  Goat Cheese & Rice shaped into patties & fried up - paired w/ these amazing roasted tomatoes & olive tampenade  Dessert for both was the Chocolate Bread Pudding & I haven't been so bowled over by a dessert in a long time - this was the bomb!  It comes out like a brownie - it's so rich & fudgey & as we sliced into it, the schwooshe of the saturated bread goes plop as it reluctantly pulls apart....it was incredible. Too sweet for Sis but she's more of a savory girl  So holding true to our designations, she liked the Crostada more & I liked the Bread Pudding more - I'm sugar, she's spice.......we're everything nice!  Will def come back here before more Greek adventures!", "business_id": "PmCzpKyHhBN1RoTEv6Edag", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-28", "type": "review"}
