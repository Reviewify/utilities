Sis loved it to no end & I thought it was very good.  Goat Cheese & Rice shaped into patties & fried up - paired w/ these amazing roasted tomatoes & olive tampenade \n\nDessert for both was the Chocolate Bread Pudding & I haven't been so bowled over by a dessert in a long time - this was the bomb! \n\nIt comes out like a brownie - it's so rich & fudgey & as we sliced into it, the schwooshe of the saturated bread goes plop as it reluctantly pulls apart....it was incredible. Too sweet for Sis but she's more of a savory girl \n\nSo holding true to our designations, she liked the Crostada more & I liked the Bread Pudding more - I'm sugar, she's spice.......we're everything nice! \n\nWill def come back here before more Greek adventures!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PmCzpKyHhBN1RoTEv6Edag"}
