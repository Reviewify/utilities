Ruth's Chris pretty much turned me off of chain steaks, but for a work dinner in the wine room, I figured it couldn't hurt :-) And......verdict.....great! The fillet was perfectly cooked, and had just the right amount of fat/meat ratio. Simply dressed and perfectly tasty. The scalloped potatoes with jalapenos and a massive amount of cheese are divine! Creamed corn was boring. The service was incredibly on the spot, and really made our evening. Tasted a friend's salmon, and it was perfectly seasoned and grilled. Too many places mess up salmon, and the natural salmoness was preserved beautifully here. Very impressed, and am looking forward to another event here!", "business_id": "2LrIkZB7mOwu8-9OVhjWfQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-20", "type": "review"}
