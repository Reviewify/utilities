I strongly suggest you avoid this place like the plague. I came here on Saturday night with a group of girls having a bachelorette party, ready to party it up and have some fun. As we walked up to this place, a couple guys up on the second floor started yelling some gross things at us, and one of the girls in our group yelled something back. Next thing we know, we heard a loud shot and there was glass raining down on us-- the guys had shot out the window above us and glass was everywhere. The bachelorette had glass all over her, and a couple people got cut. We're just lucky it wasn't worse. Anyway, we were all really shaken up, so we went inside thinking we'd let the manager know what had happened, and whoever had done it would get kicked out. We walk in and the place is relatively dead. We tell the manager what happened, and she just said, \"You can't come in unless you pay $8 a person.\" Umm... $8 a person at 9pm (this was the very beginning of the night) when there is no one else here and we just got shot at? She refused to listen to our story to take any responsibility for what had happened, and instead suggested that we leave. What kind of management turns away a huge group of girls with money to spend?? When we protested, and asked her to at least investigate if there was a gun in the building, she not only refused, but took to yelling a series of obscenities at us. Ghetto. Trashy. Never again.", "business_id": "rB3-X_DJWrwInNNJtKPnpQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-01-14", "type": "review"}
