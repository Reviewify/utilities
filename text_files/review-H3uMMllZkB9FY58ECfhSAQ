Every time my friends and I go to SLO, we always stop by Apple Farm to get their delicious cookies. We decided to have breakfast here one day. The decor of the restaurant had decor of apples and farm animals all over the place.  I had ordered the eggs and bacon. It was a good portion of food. It came with three eggs, three thick slices of bacon, hashbrowns and your choice of muffin, toast, english muffin or scone and boysenberry jelly. I chose the pumpkin muffin, it was warm and yummy. My friend got the apple muffin and that was heaven! it had a streusel topping and small chunks of apple inside.  Overall the service was good, got the food in a timely manner and prices are fair. I can't wait to go back! Only bummer was the bakery didn't have much options left at that time and it was only the afternoon! I really wanted to buy apple muffins togo. But I did buy their English toffee cookies which are the best!!", "business_id": "Gx2873IIvAYb9eRvXKJoYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-01", "type": "review"}
