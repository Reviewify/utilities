I ordered the swimming Rama and when arrived it was badly burned.  The spinach was burned and I kept bitting into disgusting charred chunks of food.  After three bites i decided i couldn't eat any more.  We were in a hurry so I let the waitress know that the food was inedible and that I would like them to remove the charge.  After arguing for several minutes about how the food was or wasn't burned they refused to remove the charge.  We got up to leave and were chased out of the restaurant for not leaving a tip.  Even after explaining why we were not tipping she continued to follow up us the street.   \nThis could have been reasonable resolved by just comping the food and apologizing, instead they have lost several customers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}
