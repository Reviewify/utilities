I was worried that this was going to be one of those restaurants where there's so much hype that the food was ONLY mediocre. Luckily, I enjoyed every bit of it. Our waiter was very kind and came to our table often to check up on us. We had the famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was very tasty and my peach waffles were mmm mmm good. I would definitely come back here again for some chicken!!!", "business_id": "zNqQSYafieEgxB2nZ8yAFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-07", "type": "review"}
