I had earlier been in a local diner where its version merited one star and had later consumed an alleged cup of Dunkin' Donuts' brew at 38000 feet that lost something at that altitude.\n\nI walked into Caffe Medici and my first thought was iced coffee. For some reason my tongue overruled my head and told me to order something hot. I did, and had what was easily my best cup in the past month. Yeah, it was hot, but I could taste the Sumatran spiciness clearly enough to want more, despite the fact that my seat was uncomfortable and the AC was blasting a bit too cool. Didn't matter. It was that good...I almost asked the server behind the counter whether they could see to opening up a location in Boston.\n\nBaked goods selection was OK. Price was reasonable and, yes I wanted a refill. Of the four or five cups of coffee I had in Austin this one ranked clearly the best. Will be back for more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PgBAgj4Iw1aZcBfRw4_ymA"}
