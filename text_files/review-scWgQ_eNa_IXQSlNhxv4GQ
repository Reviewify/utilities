But, forgive me, I was not wowed.  The service was friendly enough, but there were 3 or 4 different people serving me, which was bizarre.  The menu looks mouth watering.  My pasta was cooked PERFECTLY al dente.  But, its predominant flavor was \"overwhelming saltiness.\"  And for over $30, it was not a large portion.  Good Italian pasta needn't cost this much.  I did eat the most sinful appetizer in the world, and it was good.  The wine list is amazing, and covers this country and the world very well.  Perhaps it is well suited for a date, or using your per diem, but it won't be making my regular rotation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dje3fr7pL6_OjA_OhFasKA"}
