They are very picky about what they take, but then only give you 35% of what they are going to sell it for.  I can see why this place stays in business.  \n\nIf you have the time, you can find some really good finds here, but be prepared to spend a good long time.  The parking is a bit of a cluster.  Once you are in the front, you back out onto Guadalupe.  Not so safe.  The parking in the back is okay, unless you're carrying stuff in to sell.  Be prepared to wait to sell and take most of it home.  \n\nIt's a good option now and then.  If you haven't been, it's worth a look.  It's a chain.  I've been to them in CA.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sUv1YTAiTWwDJCB-dGPVoQ"}
