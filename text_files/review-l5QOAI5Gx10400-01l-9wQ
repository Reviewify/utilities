This little French bakery offers freshly squeezed OJ and the incredible eggs. Their croissants are lights and buttery. The breakfast sandwich is also a big hit, though large. Alot to eat for the price.\n\nThere's free wifi and the espresso drinks is great, if you need a place to stop and de-compress. Service has always been good and you can dine inside at a table, at the counter or even outside. If you want real peace and quiet, the table further from the door are a great place to dine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jGHYiK17BNNQxBxMtIBbFQ"}
