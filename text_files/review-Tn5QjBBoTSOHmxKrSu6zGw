This location has great customer service as do most Chickfilas. It is clean and they are not stingy with the sauces... HOWEVER... All my life, I've never tried their breakfast platters until fairly recently. I ordered the Breakfast platter which is supposed to contain biscuits & GRAVY, eggs, chicken.. etc. I took it to go and realized that the gravy that all my friends had been raving about was not included. So I called chickfila corporate because I tend to do this when fast food restaurants forget stuff in my togo back. McDonalds as given me coupons in reponse to food omitted in my order etc... The customer service guy called me back and said that this specific location doesn't serve gravy. WTF!!! He then tells me that the Hollywood location does. Thanks a lot. I will have to wait 10 more years til the next time I decide to eat breakfast to try their gravy out.  Chickfila breakfast platter - Gravy = 1 star. Good customer service at this location and being a Christian organization that closes on Sundays = +1 star. Verdict: 2 stars. I'll go to other chickfilas that offer their entire menu.", "business_id": "Fs7lKMANuifCyDjF99opRA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-03", "type": "review"}
