It is a perfect warm weather spot to go to. Right on the pier in Providence, tons of outdoor seating and space to hang out and dance. I've been here twice and would have given it a better rating but the bartenders are probably the worst bartenders I've ever experienced! They are awful. First of all I went July 4th weekend on a Friday night and the whole bar staff was doing shots with sailors. I wouldn't really care if they took a shot, but clearly it didn't end there. I went to close my tab and it literally took 20 minutes to get her to close my tab. Most of the ditzy girls bar tending were wasted! The only reason I finally got their attention was because the girls next to me were waiting to pay for their drinks for about 15 minutes and I told them if I were them I would have walked away a long time ago, they said they went to high school with the bar tender and couldn't do that to her. So they were the ones who got the sloppy mess's attention and told her to give me my tab. So to sum it up,  not a bad place, maybe try hiring bartenders that won't drink or can handle their liquor because after midnight the bar is packed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QAxQdJ5m-wrvLUUGb0-ulw"}
