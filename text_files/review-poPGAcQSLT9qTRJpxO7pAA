I'm not a huge fan of pho in general, but everything else is absolutely delicious. I especially love their whole fried fish, notonly for the crispy deliciousness of it; but also because there's a good chance it'll freak out somebody in the place when I devour it. \"Ohmigawd, did he just eat that fish's face?\" Hells yes. The noodle bowls are always awesome, and the rice paper wraps are some serious eating. I also recommend the 'salty fish fried rice' which desperately needs a more appetizing name, but is really quite tasty. Prices are nice and low, especially for Harvard Square. It's sometimes quiite busy, but I don't think I've had a problem getting seated there since back in the day...and that was when 12 of us showed up from out of nowhere, without calling ahead. And they still treated us pretty well. it's a real hidden gem. Great food, low prices.", "business_id": "V7z-P1aqxkHTcKAsWA603A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-30", "type": "review"}
