[only real downside, in my opinion is the effin jukebox... music is all over the shop... kind of makes for a strange atmosphere at times... i should probably note that i'm not much of a jukebox fan in general... there's always that one guy... with all the effin quarters.. that is hell bent on listening to nickleback on repeat. you know that guy.]", "business_id": "7Q2BCFpY-VOezpkcAVmsbg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-24", "type": "review"}
