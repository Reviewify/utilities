Every time...every. SINGLE. TIME:  I wait an interminable amount of time for my food.  I'm not talking about when it's crazy either, I'm talking about when I pop in and I'm the only person in line...and maybe there are a few after me.  Nothing crazy, nobody's rushing about...in fact, that's the problem, there is NO RUSHING.  There is no sense of urgency about anything, including and especially your food.  \n\nI can't even talk about the quality of the food because I'm so pissed that I've just spent 45 minutes waiting for a salad (no joke, this happened),  and that I have so little time to eat my food, I can barely taste it.  This is always when I have about half an hour for lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CYXdwQeDSv8vtiEjRfkcOA"}
