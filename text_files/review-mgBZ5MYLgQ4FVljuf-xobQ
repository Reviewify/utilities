They have a limited menu but theres something that appeals to everyone on it. The beer and wine selection is also quite satisfying.  The decor is simple in a good way, nothing popping out to draw your eye away from your meal and dinnermates. I had the burger and it was excellent, something abit out of the ordinary but perfect to say the least. The fries and slaw were also very nice. I cannot say that the rest of my party agreed as they commented on their food being bland (fish, chicken salad) Although the 4th member had a very nice steak. I would definitely go back but probably enjoy the bar menu and afew cocktails.", "business_id": "-DpB583IrJuH1ehHu-U8sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-11", "type": "review"}
