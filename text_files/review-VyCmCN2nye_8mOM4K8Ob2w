The beer was fine, but the server was inattentive, to start. After slowly delivering a beverage and an appetizer, she took our order for dinner. And then the wait began. Our neighbors at the adjoining atale ordered, received and completed their dinners, including their toddler's meal (and we all know how slowly kids can eat). Atill no dinner and no word from our server. After looking at her pointedly a few times with no results, I called her over, only to be told that, yeah, she had just asked and the beef tenderloin was taking a while. ok, no need to update us. Once we finally received our meals, we found the meat to be ok, the garlic mashed potatoes - meh. The broccoli? close to raw and no seasoning whatsoever.   The beer was quite enjoyable - but not enough to lure us back to such an atrocious evening.", "business_id": "8mYNPK-XbYpp8JweXVLNAQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-13", "type": "review"}
