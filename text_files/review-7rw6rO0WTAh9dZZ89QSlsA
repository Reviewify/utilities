Worst dining experience I have had in years.  I ordered masago sushi, a spicy tuna roll and chicken curry with brown rice.  I also had ice teas and water.  Good things about the place: nice patio, big glasses of ice tea.  Bad things: everything else.  I waited 20 minutes after being seated to get a menu, 20 minutes to order, 30 minutes before I saw the chicken curry come out (I sent it back because I had asked to have the sushi first), and an hour to get the sushi.  The masago was fine, but the only flavor in the spicy tuna roll was mayonaisse.  The curry was watery and flavorless and the brown rice was bland from overcooking rather than nutty as it should have been.   There were two waitresses, one buzzed by to ask me if I'd like more ice tea, another came by and asked me if I wanted more water.  Both times I said yes and neither time did they bring it.  They did keep trying to bring me the curry dish I'd asked them to hold until the sushi came. After a while, it took on a surreal trapped in hell quality.  I'd read the paper and then start to time them. 20 minutes here, 30 there. Took me two and a half hours to get out of there. Though the last 20 were waiting for them to pick up the check. In the end, I tossed down almost exact change and left.", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-02-09", "type": "review"}
