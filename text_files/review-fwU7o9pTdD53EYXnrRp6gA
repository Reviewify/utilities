However, they need to work on their baking skills. I tried the almond twist and the pumpkin bread loaf. The almond twist was very hard and it was no freshly baked. The pumpkin bread did not taste like pumpkin at all. I guess once you tried a good chinese bakery such as Shengkee in Richmond, you have a much finer taste of how fresh tasty baked goods are and the things in UCafe are not. It looks good but it ain't good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Gia-6TO8WwPMSHdn86EozQ"}
