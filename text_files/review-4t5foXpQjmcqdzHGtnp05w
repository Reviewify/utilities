Food--excellent, ambience--pleasant, service--great. For our $25 prix fixe menu, I got the thai spring rolls, salmon roulade, and candy bar.  The spring rolls were so tasty, and beautifully presented. You get two smallish rolls in a large peanut and cabbage salad with dressing.  It felt like a big portion, and every bite was delicious.  The salmon roulade initially struck me as strange (it looked like a portion of lobster!), but it was yummy and came with lots of little extras--crispy sushi rice, a corn and edamame salad, and some drizzly goodness.  Each bite had layers.  Finally, the candy bar.  Holy shit.  Can I say that here?  I mean, seriously.  It was incredible.  It's not a regular menu item (I asked), and as far as I know the owner doesn't have plans to sell it in stores (If you're reading this, Mr/Ms Owner, seriously, right now, start selling this.  It puts Zang bars to shame.).  It's just... damn.  Cinammony, maybe nutmegy?  A nougat covered in dark chocolate, some pistachio mash, some fresh whipped cream with homemade potato chips.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I may need to change my shirt.  This dessert, alone, is worth the $25 dinner.  I mean, not really, but you know what I mean? It's hard to follow that, I know, but my boyfriend also really enjoyed his meal.  He got the same spring rolls, but then got the chicken entree.  It was like a juicy fried chicken.  For the dessert, cheesecake.  A small portion, but tasty, with a nice fresh caramel drizzle on the plate. So, lovely. Why not 5 stars?  It's expensive, and I withhold my 5s for really breathtaking meals. The candy bar here was 5-star level, the spring rolls were pretty close, but the other pieces were happy 4s.", "business_id": "qkw4xWWgTufvBs1NcxsFnw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-10", "type": "review"}
