This restaurant had high expectations in my book and this place did not fail.  The decor is fantastic; from the tables with rose or gold glittered patterns to the wall of luchador masks as you ascend the stairs to the second level.  A car is installed near the front of the restaurant.  Part table for patrons and part decor.  A nice touch to this fun restaurant that serves excellent mexican food.  \n  My fiance and her sister ate lunch here.  We ordered the Blue Demon Express, which consisted of 2 courses of your choosing from the designated areas on the lunch menu.  \n\nComplimentary:\nChips and Salsa\n(The chips are freshly made and lightly salted.  The salsa was flavorful and mild.)\n\nOrdered:\nTraditional Guacamole with cotija cheese $10 \n(We ordered this for the table.  The avocados were delayed a bit because the delivery just arrived.  Although it was a little tardy, it didn't disappoint.  The flavors of the avocado came through with every bite as if it was still kissing the pit.  The hint of chili peppers exploded in you mouth under the cover of avocado as if the chili was a kid in class raising their hand wanting to answer a question.)\n\nMy first course was the Tortilla Soup. The soup was spicy, with massive flavor.  The pieces of tortilla, chicken, tomatoes, onions and spices were mixed masterfully into a bowl of tasty goodness.\n\nThe main course was a flat bread with mushrooms, herbs and  cheese. A brilliant cap to the meal.\n\nHad one bite of the chop salad, which was refreshingly tart with a hint of sweetness at the end.\n\nAlso had one bite of the hamachi tachos.  Crunchy yet tender with a hint of tart and sweetness.\n\nDecor:5\nFood:5\nService:5\n \nWould I go back?  You bet your pastrami I would!", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g"}
