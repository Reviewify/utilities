Well that was how I felt after I ate here, b/c my throat suffered CHEMICAL BURNS from their avocado spread.  I understand that restaurants have to find some way of preventing avocados from oxidizing and turning that horrifying shade of booger green.  But when I bit into my turkey avocado sandwich from here, I was SMACKED on the palette by an overwhelming flavor of acid, coupled with a strange grainy-ness that I pinpointed to the avocado spread.  I'm assuming that the workers on that day DUMPED whatever chemical they use to acidify the avocados into the spread, creating a weapon of mass destruction.  My throat was so horribly BURNT from this sandwich that I was hoarse and had difficulty swallowing for several days afterwards.  I haven't been back since - I'd really like to avoid having to use those voice box thingys.  Stay away if you value the well-being of you and yours.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mUGiS3OAHFax0saS6k0vVA"}
