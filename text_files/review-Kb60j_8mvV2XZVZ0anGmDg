But it's the annoying Dr. Demento brand of crazy, not the cool Dennis Hopper kind. The crust are just downright repugnant, particularly the sicilian style slices which have the consistency of fried dough that got left under the couch and discovered five months later.  The toppings, however, do offer a shot at redemption.  Bacon and potato, or buffalo chicken are some intriguing options, and are quite tasty even if they have the consistency of a teething ring. I'd say walk the extra block and get a slice at Pinnochio's.  The flavors may be more traditional, but the pizza itself is just head and shoulders above this stuff.", "business_id": "9-zcdAehWLYVGF3PJTqhIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2006-06-07", "type": "review"}
