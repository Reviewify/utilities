Off I went to search for the bakery. First time I drove by it. it's very easy to miss but here are some landmarks: There is a skate park next to it and an auto shop right before it.  \n\nI walked in here not knowing what to expect, high prices? Not what I was looking for?\n\nWalked in and first saw they love us on yelp! I knew I was in the right place. I was welcomed and then took a look at  what they were selling. I right away saw the cupcakes. They looks great! there was a chocolate one with chocolate frosting, and then a red velvet with a vanilla type of frosting on top. I ordered the red velvet one. The price was just right 2.25 and after eating this cupcake I wanted another. The red velvet had a nice crunchy top and it was still very moist below. The frosting complemented it just right! It wasn't too sweet. It had this type of flavor that is hard to describe, it taste like vanilla but different! The cupcakes were a perfect size and I felt that i was much better priced and tasty cupcake than those other popular ones in DC. \n\nShortcake Bakery is still going through renovations and will attract much attention. Do not be fooled by the appearance, it is a great place to stop by at if you are in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cd11AiNEeUSrxoiAZxw3bw"}
