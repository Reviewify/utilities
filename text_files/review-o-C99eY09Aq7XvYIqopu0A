I'm never impressed but if you're too lazy to walk down to Mel's Burger or leave the 'hood it's a good standby. Not a destination restaurant though. One thing that does impress are the buffalo fries (fries in hot wing sauce). Generally this place functions better if beer is the primary directive. Also, note this 'uptown' locale is certainly more of a dive than its Manhattan Valley sister. The Mac n cheese was a disappointment, unless you prefer sun-dried tomatoes to pasta.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VAkdznBlCPQ7KFvm-Kma0g"}
