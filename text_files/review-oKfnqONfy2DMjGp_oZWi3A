Based on reviews here, I took a pair to Jimmy's to have the heels fixed. This was the only pair of shoes I could wear to a funeral (without looking ridiculous), and they fixed them the same day and were very nice about it. The work was done right, and shoes look really fabulous. I'm now taking them all the other shoes that I love so much I've worn them out. They do luggage repair, too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gWKUg9L0cWkGRsa1ztN72A"}
