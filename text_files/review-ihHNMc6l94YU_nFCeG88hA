I love their assortment of yogurts and toppings and the 30 cents an ounce is such a great deal. However, this particular day, I was very disappointed. I was so excited to get plain yogurt with fruits, but for some reason the machine wasn't working. Neither was the new berry tart that I wanted to try and various other flavors. I ended up getting red velvet, which is AMAZING, but I still wanted plain. Also, everytime I come, the topping area is messy, but that's probably because this yogurtland is always busy. Other than that, I love yogurtland, but was disappointed the day I went.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NxmRPUDi2UGnj6moH0mKAg"}
