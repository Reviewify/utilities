City people! Tiana at Bliss has spoiled me, and today I got an appointment with her to clean up the other \"technician's work.\n\nAs always, she set to work with the upmost discretion, but \"HELLO very expensive intimidating woman in New York, something was wrong with your wax!\" and poor Tiana had to clean up all of the broken hairs.  And I don't even have a lot of hair!\n\nI'm around the globe frequently, but there is no replacing Tiana at Bliss. Not only does she do the cleanest Brazilian known to woman, she recommended a divine facial balm that I can't imagine getting on a plane without.\n\nGo Tiana! \n\nP.S. My boyfriend wants to put her on our Christmas card list... awwww.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tsuLHd1E2SFQunLNSCYGTQ"}
