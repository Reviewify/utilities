Apparently, this place is well known for its Sake bomb Combo special;Once we got there we could then see why . \n\nCollege kids + sake bombs (Large beer + Small hot Sake) + one roll for only 10.99! Oh sweet jebus, they obviously know what we want. \n\nThe service was nice , the seating is limited and the rolls were edible & were definitely made to satisfy the public (it lacked authenticity). After an hour of splendid gluttony and only 20 dollars per girl we walked out stuffed and drunk as a skunk. I can't argue with that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QiiuqzcD4HUqYpKhhGXU6Q"}
