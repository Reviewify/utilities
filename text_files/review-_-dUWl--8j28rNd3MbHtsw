Red Hawk simply has really, really good bar food. We started with duck quesadillas, which were awesome. I had their weekly special, a shrimp and oyster po' boy with lamb and potato soup. The sandwich was good, and the soup...well, I wish I had a 5 gallon drum of it to eat throughout the winter....really good stuff. I also had a taste of the cuban sandwich with chorizo, the most unique and tasty sandwich I've had in quite some time. I feel like bars with \"unique\" menus typically are a let down, but Red Hawk definitely lived up to the hype.", "business_id": "fqglBnvsDzii6hxQ5a78cQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-20", "type": "review"}
