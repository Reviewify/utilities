Apparently it's modeled off the gourmet coffee trucks found in NYC, and while I'll have to very grudgingly admit it after the World Series, it's a great importation and addition to the local coffee options. So far, I've only had their regular coffee, but it is really effing good. It's smooth and rich, and not burnt to a crisp like Starbucks (as if that were any kind of contender). The prices are reasonable: $2 for 16oz, and they also have an assortment of pastries. I'll definitely be coming back for more.", "business_id": "LKARmHZQs4cF5_OtE196xw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-08", "type": "review"}
