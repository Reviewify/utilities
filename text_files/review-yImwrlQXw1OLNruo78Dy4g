A group of girlfriends & I visited Karma Yoga Studio to celebrate the pending nuptials of a dear friend & yoga enthusiast. More than half of our group were yoga novice and our private class was really wonderful- allowing everyone to practice at their own pace. I am typically not very easily relaxed, and I must say, after 75 minutes of yoga with private instruction, I nearly fell asleep thinking about my intention. For a non yoga-er, this was a pretty eye-opening experience...and if I can find some time & put my blackberry down for a bit, I'll try and make it back for more of the good vibes here.", "business_id": "qh_MkbGg1k2j6X1ZcNhzfw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-22", "type": "review"}
