I wanted a mimosa with my bfast!!! But it's ok, I drank somewhere else afterwards. They parking situation was good for me cause as soon as I pulled up, a car was leaving so I got lucky! The wait wasn't too long, I met my friend on a saturday at 11am, the normal weekend bfast time and we were seated about 10 minutes after putting our name down. I ordered an omelette cause I'm always on a diet. I was going to get the maui wowie but i could get the make ur own for cheaper and add more veggies! the food was good but i wish i was eating pancakes cause i kept staring at other people's food. The staff was very nice and friendly. I would def. be back.", "business_id": "BonZ748EKm8pwtVQalFpYQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}
