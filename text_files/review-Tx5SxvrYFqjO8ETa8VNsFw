You can ask for a combination of whatever they have available to satisfy your palate. \n\nThe downside to this is that if they actually remember with accuracy what to add to your crepe, the chances are they'll burn it. \n\nOr maybe forget that you ordered a crepe completely. \n\nOr maybe they'll also be rude when you remind them about that crepe they forgot about. \n\n...I still don't understand how this is considered \"night life,\" since this place isn't open very late. Its hours seem to be dependent on whether or not someone shows up to work there. Sketchy sketchy !", "type": "review", "business_id": "fdBaf_H31MY4nA4Yuw6MfQ"}
