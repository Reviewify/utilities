Behind Au Bon Pan is this shop that barely fits 10 people inside, called La Creperie.  The menu is not too extensive (a simple list of savory and sweet crepes, 3 waffles and drinks), but that is easily compensated by CUSTOM ORDERING. You can ask for a combination of whatever they have available to satisfy your palate.  The downside to this is that if they actually remember with accuracy what to add to your crepe, the chances are they'll burn it.  Or maybe forget that you ordered a crepe completely.  Or maybe they'll also be rude when you remind them about that crepe they forgot about.  ...I still don't understand how this is considered \"night life,\" since this place isn't open very late. Its hours seem to be dependent on whether or not someone shows up to work there. Sketchy sketchy !", "business_id": "fdBaf_H31MY4nA4Yuw6MfQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-05-02", "type": "review"}
