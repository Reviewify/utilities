The deli in this Ralph's is FAR superior to all other Ralph's delis. I've heard a rumor that this Ralph's is one of the highest grossing Kroger stores in the country, and they are really re-investing some of their profit in their store. The deli has fresh sandwiches, paninis, freshly grilled meats, rotisserie chicken, nice salad/soup bar, the works. Perfect lunchtime fare. Love their chicken strips. Not as \"grocery store\" cheap as I'd like it to be, but if you're on a budget, grab a baguette for .99 cents, 3 of 4 slices of meat and cheese from the deli, and have yourself a country sandwich for two for $4. You can really make this place work to your budget. Anyways, it gets nutso busy here on the lunch hour, so be careful. But don't count out the deli when you're thinking about lunch (but watch out of the people who confuse the gas for the brake and run their car through the front store window...like they did in 2007)!", "business_id": "GGzgUd6k6aOHPp7PrT6d6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-31", "type": "review"}
