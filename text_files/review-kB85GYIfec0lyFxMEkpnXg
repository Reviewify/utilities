After searching all over the internet, I decided to give Daphne's a chance...  Being a Greek cafe, they don't sell Middle Eastern/turkish food like the kebabs you can eat in Europe. However, they do have good tasting lamb and chicken kebabs. Today they had a $6 special dinner. so for $6, i got a small pita bread+hummus, a large plate of gyros+rice+salad, and a tiny Greek dessert that is super sweet. I don't eat much normally bu today i was so hungry and wanted to eat lamb so bad, and it satisfied me! i want more!!", "business_id": "K-2s-27wildukxnsRRoc4g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-23", "type": "review"}
