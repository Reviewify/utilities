A good restaurant: As far as food goes I recommend the soups (yummm) as well as the Santa Fe wrap. \n2. A good coffee shop: The coffee is good, atmosphere during the day can be studious but not overly quiet, and plugs are available for those with lap tops. \n3. A good bar: There is often live music and generally a good crowd with good vibes here. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ksRoyJsttIQnTt_nMk--GA"}
