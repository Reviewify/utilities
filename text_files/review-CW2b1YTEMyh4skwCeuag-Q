However, after my first half-marathon a couple weeks ago, I'm hooked and decided it was time to kick off my full marathon training with a new pair of running shoes.  Although I usually grab a pair of Nikes from the mall, I have a history of shin issues and the pain was starting to come back so I listened to my coworker's suggestion and headed to Finger Lakes Running Company. I ended up talking to three different people on three different days before I bought a pair but everyone was super friendly, super knowledgeable, and super helpful!  They were very attentive to all my concerns/questions and made sure I was 100% comfortable in my decision. To this end, they analyzed my foot/stride, explained the potential hows & whys of my shin pain, looked at my previous shoe, gave me a huge range of shoes to try on, and let me test run each shoe outside.  I ended up buying a pair of Mizuno Wave Rider 12s and had a really good run breaking them in. Ian (the owner) also gave me a complimentary FLRC running shirt (that matches my shoes! priorities, you know?). Although the buying process took longer than expected, it was one of the best service experiences I've had and I'm as hooked on FLRC as I am on running!", "business_id": "QE9JPcbaUycwoVcv8EV2NQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-06", "type": "review"}
