To be honest, I only came here because the line for Regents pizza was out the door and had to take a short lunch. It was practically empty inside here.  The sandwiches are decent, although I think it's pretty difficult to mess up a sandwich. There is nothing to really set this place apart from Subway or Togos. Prices were not very different either. The wheat bread on my sandwich was a bit dry and extremely glossy on the outside. The service was mediocre. Don't know if I'll be back.", "business_id": "RnJfohkID4P3symIH7FiYg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}
