So I went to this MW on Lake to see if I could get one quickly. They had a pretty good collection, but their sales personnel had crappy attitudes. One of them kept calling me \"dude\" and the other got annoyed at me and walked away when I didn't really like his choices (they were too corporate for me). I was looking for something a little more alternative and they seemed to have those, but the sales guys kept pushing the more expensive corporate looking suits on me. \n\nFinal word - shop here, but stay clear of the sales guys.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9EcwR4x-UTqx6WmfRCzeCA"}
