I placed my order at 12pm and the estimated time was 45 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, I'm super hungry and I call the place. I let the phone ring for a long time and nobody picks up. I call again and after about 10 rings, some girl FINALLY picks up. I ask about my order and she says \"ooh.... I'm sorry, we haven't made your order yet. We will make it now.\" I am pretty annoyed at this point... I continue waiting and at 2:15pm, TWO HOURS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, a lady calls saying she's outside with my food. FINALLY, THE END OF MY STARVATION AND MISERY...???? NO. I go outside in the cold and stands there looking around for 30 seconds. The lady calls again and says, \"Sorry, I got the wrong place. I will be around 10 minutes.\" OKAY lady, now i'm ticked. I live like 3 blocks away from your restaurant. If I weren't feeling sick today I'd go get food myself. HOW the eff do you take this long to get my food to me?! I still don't have my food right now. It's been 10 minutes since that lady last called. Which is why I'm writing this review. The first review I've ever written on yelp. DELIVERY SERVICE HERE SUCKS BALLS.", "business_id": "RDa29pAaWeZjA9MvAry7Gw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-13", "type": "review"}
