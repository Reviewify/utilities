I've heard a lot of things about Japengo so I had pretty high expectations. The appetizers we ordered were very good but I wasn't crazy about the rolls and sushi. The entree dishes looked really good though. I'm giving 3 stars because I was expecting more of a wow factor.", "business_id": "baeBGUjh035MU3UkHvp8Vg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}
