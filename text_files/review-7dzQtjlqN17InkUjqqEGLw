I was very impressed with the thorough nature of the exam, and also had my first glaucoma baseline test as a previous reviewer mentioned.  Dr. Phillips was very personable and took time to make sure I was confident that my prescription was going to be right on.  I really liked the two women working out front as well.  They both commented on my frames (a brand they recently picked up) and did a great job explaining what they could do to improve the quality of the lenses (the first set are VERY poor quality).  I'm also a VSP member and did not feel any less welcome as a result.  Looking forward to getting my new lenses early next week!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dsa4xcvjpam21cZTycsUXg"}
