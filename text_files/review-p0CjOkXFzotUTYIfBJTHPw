It took a while of standing at the front to even get noticed, then forever to get our food. I can only assume that there was a staffing crisis, because the next time I went, there were 2 waiters, and it was on a much less busy weekday night. We were immediately noticed and seated, and our order was taken promptly and cheerfully. Our appetizers came out really quick, then our food immediately afterwards. This was really fast, because let me tell you, when we order sushi, we order a TON. Like, surely-they're-making-fun-of-the-fat-Americans-back-in-the-kitchen amounts.  My only complaint for this visit was the noise level.  It seemed as though there was some kind of a reunion going on at the table next to ours, which had at least 10 people at it.  They were all getting pretty sauced and obnoxious.  This really wasn't the fault of the restaurant, but it's so small that they were drowning out our conversation, if not all of the conversations in the restaurant. All of the sushi was right on. It was expensive, but isn't it always?", "business_id": "C31ExBTn_6UxbTVkWPtNkg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-08", "type": "review"}
