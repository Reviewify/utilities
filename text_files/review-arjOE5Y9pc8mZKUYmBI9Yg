The service was excellent - our food came out very quickly and everything was yummy! I highly recommend the crab rangoons. Unlike many restaurants, they were made with real, fresh crab. They were served with a carrot ketchup. I can't wait to go back!", "business_id": "jxTZafP6SAsFEZzNmjQqbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-19", "type": "review"}
