Decided to stop in because I heard good things from a co-worker. Went into the simple restaurant at lunch-time, and the pizza looked good. They warmed it for me and it was 2 slices for less than $5. Really good pizza, and good price.", "business_id": "4y49CSzDlkZB7nkyViZuzg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-02", "type": "review"}
