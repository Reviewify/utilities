When better service is so easily available, then UHS is clearly a \"methinks not.\" The worst experience I had: I needed physical therapy for my knee at one point, and the physician at UHS insisted I use the UHS facility instead of one of the university's dedicated rehab centers. The UHS facility has no weight or cardio machines, just exercise balls and thera-bands. It took a second opinion from a non-UHS doctor to get the referral to the rehab center, where I worked for almost 3 months to get my knee back to normal shape. Both my doctor and my physical therapist agreed that the bare-bones facilities at UHS would not have had the equipment I needed to rehab the knee. I actually went to UHS immediately when I injured the knee. I've had knee problems since I was a teen and knew right away that the situation was not good. I was not able to walk without a limp and significant pain. The PA I saw gave me a cursory physical examination and told me to take Advil for a few days and come back if it didn't get better. It was incredibly disrespectful of my assessment of my own pain and body. This is why I initially sought my second opinion, which later came in handy to gain access to the rehab center. I've had some ok experiences here too, but why bother with inconsistent quality of care when a truly excellent facility less than 1 mile away accepts the same insurance? I would also recommend not using UHS' in-house pharmacy. They do a fine job in terms of filling the script, but there is almost always a long wait for pick up.", "business_id": "knOJIzSpCUY1yV3VJx_xNg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-01", "type": "review"}
