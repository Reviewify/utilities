It's a build your own salad type of thing: you tell the workers what kind of lettuce blend you'd like and what toppings/dressings, and they'll mix it all up and dump it into a take-out box with a few pieces of pita bread on the side. \n\nFor me, Sebastian's has become an essential because I get these uncontrollable cravings for a huge salad every few days, and Sebastian's always satisfies. The salad is HUGE, like nearly impossible to consume in one sitting (although I do, because I know how to eat). My vegetables have always been extremely fresh, and I like that you can add on tofu without an extra charge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c577WXP83PAcIyDiaCtrDQ"}
