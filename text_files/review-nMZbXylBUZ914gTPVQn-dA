Unlike other reviewers, there was not a long wait at all and the staff seemed very friendly. It was relatively busy and everyone's food seemed to be coming out in a timely manner.  My boyfriend and I each got sandwiches. The bread was really fresh and the sandwich was a decent price...$6 - $9. \n\nBottom line, try it for yourself. I'm glad I didn't pass this place by based on other people's experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0nwOwZGlB4v6XfuPLd-HWA"}
