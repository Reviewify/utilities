Unlike other reviewers, there was not a long wait at all and the staff seemed very friendly. It was relatively busy and everyone's food seemed to be coming out in a timely manner. My boyfriend and I each got sandwiches. The bread was really fresh and the sandwich was a decent price...$6 - $9. Bottom line, try it for yourself. I'm glad I didn't pass this place by based on other people's experience.", "business_id": "0nwOwZGlB4v6XfuPLd-HWA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-24", "type": "review"}
