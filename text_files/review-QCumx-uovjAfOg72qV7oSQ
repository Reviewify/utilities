The food is meh, service quality depends on whether the restaurant is busy or not. Pricey menu. Yet I've found myself coming here for the 3rd and 4th time especially for gathering with some Viet friends. Because, as I said, this is pretty much the only place you can go for.  The Pho is okay for quality, not so good, not so bad. The Hu Tiu wasn't so good - there was some Cha Lua (vietnamese ham) and imitation crab in there (this was quite a couple years ago). One time I ordered a lunch special, and even though it was cheaper than the average menu price, I think the food portion is much, much smaller. I'm petite size and that day I wasn't even extremely hungry, but I found myself sweeping off the last grain of rice on the plate. The soup that comes with the lunch special is a big disappointment. I think my friend tried Bun Mang Ga wasn't so bad. the Ca Kho To was a big disappointment - the \"sauce\" was way too much and too liquidy instead of a thick, condensed sauce. The fish didn't even have caramelized... The Canh chua and Lau Thai are wayyyyy overpriced, but taste decent. Again: I haven't ordered these dishes in a couple years, things might have been changed. I love their Banh Mi though, $4 for some delicious Vietnamese banh mi... oh lord I'm in heaven.", "business_id": "sRO-U8Kxd1tXJlENTqv89A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-30", "type": "review"}
