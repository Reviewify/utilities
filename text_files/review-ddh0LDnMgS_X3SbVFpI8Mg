The staff is very kind and attentive- they seat you right away and give you a choice of patio or indoor seating. They offer you champagne right when you sit down, but if you look young make sure you bring your ID, they card anyone that looks younger than 30 it seems.\n     The food selection was vast, with mostly Mexican cuisine but also American options (in case you're in a large group w/ a random picky lame person). I LOVED the dessert selection, lots of cakes and pies and flan and cookies, etc. Most of all I love the small mariachi group. They go table to table and have an extensive repertoire of songs. They are also extremely friendly (I've been places where the mariachi doesn't even smile- changes the atmosphere completely). \n    Overall, a great choice for any occasion, esp. for birthdays and anniversaries tho. Sunday brunch is my personal fav time to go.\n\nedit: This edit is 1+ years after my original post. I only have more great things to say about this place. Who would've thought that, in the tiny town of Claremont, one could find a genuine nest of Mexican culture. They have live music 3-4 days a week (Mariachi during Sunday brunch, and Fridays 6-9 PM). The bartenders are super fun and friendly, and will often give free shots to the whole bar during karaoke nights. In general, this is a chill place to go with a group of friends when you guys want some dinner w/ entertainment in a nice authentic atmosphere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "59z1PjiYi5yWrMmn2fKavA"}
