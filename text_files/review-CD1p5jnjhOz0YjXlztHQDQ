I started going to the 6:15 am classes several months ago as an idea to beat my morning commute. I was sort of skeptical that I would stick with it, but I really fell in love. The fact that this studio motivates me to wake up at 5 am, shuffle out into the cold, and drive an hour to sweat my ass off is testament. The studio is really friendly, there's a nice little camaraderie. I have to shout out to Michael & Lauren-- the morning teachers. They are both awesome and offer really great classes. Michael is particularly friendly and welcoming, which is certainly helpful at 6 am!", "business_id": "-sBRtVo0bwLAtru_-iFmcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-03", "type": "review"}
