It's all about the breakfast food. It's all about the POTATOES!! I think I have a soft spot for this location in particular (which, I think, has better POTATOES) because I use to live down the street, but either way, it's diner food with a superior delicious factor.\n\nYes, there is a wait, but welcome to Pittsburgh. Any good breakfast/brunch spot has a wait between 12 and 3 on weekends. Just go early or late and you'll be fine. I've never waited more than 15 minutes or so, even if there were people in front of me. The service is fast. The staff is accommodating. The food is delicious (get any of the omelets or the pancakes - those thin pancakes are to die for). In fact, on my latest visit to Pittsburgh, I INSISTED that we stop at Pamela's first thing so I could get my fave omelet and those fantabulous potatoes. You'll love it! Dig in and enjoy guys.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gOtY-I9lvbyOUShbBhCChQ"}
