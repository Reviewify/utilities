There was a 45 minute wait to be seated, which was not fun, but it was all worth it when the food got there. The Migas & Fajitas were unbelievable. Out of all the places I have tried Migas, it currently sits on top at #1. It was quite tasty. Also, their Bloody Mary's are fantastic - I recommend the spice infused Vodka. Their Mexican Martinis are really not that strong or good compared to Chuy's and others. Health Inspection Score of 81 compared to 93 at Trudy's North Star", "business_id": "fL_ilXgNUq_j9vMpZwdcLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-02", "type": "review"}
