Now it's my one-stop-shop for this one particular vegetarian dish they have. The *String Beans & Tofu*: it's unhealthy I'm sure but very very delicious and hits the veggie chinese fast food spot whenever I need it. Everything about that dish is fantastic. As far as the rest of the food, I've only had 2 other veg dishes that were just meh and nothing with meat in it. Skip the eggroll, it's just extra calories and indulge in the string beans & tofu!", "business_id": "H54IpFMRBPxMwWsX2z9qmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-22", "type": "review"}
