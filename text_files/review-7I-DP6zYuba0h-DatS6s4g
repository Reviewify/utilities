The Ma Po Tofu that I ordered was a huge let-down, so much so that I couldn't justify eating the leftovers. Rather than being a thick, flavorful stew, it was basically pieces of tofu floating in a bland, thin broth (with bits of what looked to be peas and carrots?). What's worse is that aside from a slight tinge of vinegar and heat, the sauce had been depressingly void of flavor; even Sriracha sauce couldn't save it. Granted I had opten out of the pork, but I think that taking out the meat shouldn't have resulted in that much of a downturn.  My Szechwan eggplant was better, but not good enough to merit a second visit.  While, like others have said, I really wanted to love this \"hole-in-the-wall\" cozy kind of Chinese/Korean/Thai joint with what seems like a very sweet owner, I can't say that I'll be going back for a third try.", "business_id": "LsILevbq-MfE4HO8o9KunQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-05", "type": "review"}
