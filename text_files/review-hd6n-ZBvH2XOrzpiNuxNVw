The new venue is spacious and beautiful. The play was Ibsen's A Doll House. Calista Flockhart was the shinning star of the show and what an amazing performance she put on. The rest of the cast were equally as good but the roll of Nora keeps the focus on Calista and she did not disappoint. Only on 'til Sunday but each month they put on these terrific radio plays (professional actors standing behind microphones-no costumes or scenery.) I have been a subscriber for 5 years and absolutely never been disappointed.", "business_id": "ZhCZlOBDvcBO8tdesXY2tA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-26", "type": "review"}
