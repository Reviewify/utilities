It was getting late, just managed to get our order in before the kitchen closed. Food was good, beer was cold, service was very pleasant. As I sat waiting for our food I was looking at the pictures posted to yelp. One (thanks Sarah M.) showed a floor-plan that included a bowling alley. At the end of the meal we asked about the bowling alley, and this resulted us being taken on a tour (that also included a look at the Saengerrunde Hall - http://saengerrunde.org). Now I don't want to go all history on you, but this location has some serious history, not only including the aforementioned bowling alley and music hall, but also with an author by the (pen) name of O. Henry.  So while the drinking and dining experience would definitely be a solid 4-stars in my book, and would be totally fan-worthy in my opinion, the personal tour at the end of our meal made this a truly 5-star experience.", "business_id": "BkJtywTAG-a9fU6rdaL6UQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-29", "type": "review"}
