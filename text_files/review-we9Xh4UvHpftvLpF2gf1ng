Everything from the staff, the shirts, the shoes, the jackets, the recommended ensemble put together by the fabulous employees, etc. \n\nIf you are a girl, and you dig sort of the urban femininity style (urban outfitters esq) this is the store to go to. Everything from this store will create a look that is both sexy and cool. Best part of it is that the forced look of vintage that is so rampant in urban outfitters does not exist in this store.\n\nFirst off, they have new clothes ALL THE TIME. The owner there brings new stuff all the time, moving many clothes to the sale section.\n\nWhen I used to live in the U-district, I would go check it out 3-4 times a week. They would always have something fresh, from Free people, Bench, and other brands less well known. They have an excellent jacket collection especially during fall/winter, and their shoe selection is equally impressive. There was never a day that I'd walk in this store and didn't walk out with something that I really loved.\n\nI recommend Delanie ( I don't actually know if this is how to spell her name) as s stylist and just a general pal at this store. She always has a beautiful smile on her face, great new tattoos, and a genuine excitement to help you out to find the clothes that YOU would want!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zh-mmgUey0oRDoDsHyYo6Q"}
