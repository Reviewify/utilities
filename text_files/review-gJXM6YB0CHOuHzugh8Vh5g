So dress better than you normally would to fit in :) Bloomie's, Banana, Neiman Marcus, Sephora, Keils, William Sonoma, Smith Hawkin, Pottery Barn, Macy's, Kate Spade, Burberry, Tiffany and MANY more. Be prepared to spend money - the cheapest place in this mall is the sale rack at Express where you can buy their shitty $10 tank tops. It is a gorgeous area to walk around - outdoor malls rock. What would be awesome is if a crap store like Forever 21 moved in and then I could wear torn jeans and a cheap tshirt without getting stares.", "business_id": "2oFme3IiUSSi0PdAJNBxwg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-10", "type": "review"}
