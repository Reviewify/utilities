On the plus side the coffee was strong, the tea was good, the menu had a wonderful variety. My husband and I did enjoy our meals . . . when they came. Now, the negatives were a bit too hard to ignore. We sat down at 12:40pm. By 1:40 pm we had no silverware, no napkins, just 3/4 empty water glasses and our coffee/tea. I watched a different waitress come over to another table to drop our meals off- very confused that the people at the neighboring table DIDN'T order the crepe my husband was waiting for. A very nice manager came over after we watched our meals be delivered to someone else to apologize and tell us \"the drinks are on me.\" She never did convey that to our server, who while very pleasant and somewhat attentive, was too overworked to actually come by and find out that detail. Now that brings me to the next major negative. There is a fine line between cozy and cramped. The table was too small to fit our meals and drinks so I managed to spill my tea. In the process of cleaning up, the staff was helpful enough to get a rag . . . but not to replace our napkins. Yes, these are small points. Taken together, though, they really make me sour on the whole experience. I will give the Duck and Bunny another chance. I wouldn't NOT recommend it, the food and selection are too good. I can't say the service was all out awful, just scattered, disjointed and pretty inattentive.", "business_id": "BbkF6j51IbcX-ed1f-bnhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-09", "type": "review"}
