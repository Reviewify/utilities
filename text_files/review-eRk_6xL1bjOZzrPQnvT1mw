The ex was in full aggro mood and bent on destroying any happiness I would ever have. He used to make such a big deal of Valentines day and I hated it. Personally, I feel it's a commercial holiday designed to sucker folks into spending inflated amounts of money and I refuse to partake. Ever, even when I was a part of a couple. \n\nThe morning started out with Keane negating the whole day for me: \n\n                                                        2 - 14 - 12 = 0 \n\nPoof, it no longer exist. See, that's why he's my favorite rock star. Unfortunately someone forgot to send this memo to the ex because he decided to ruin the day for me. Again. And Again. And then Again. Ugh. \n\nLuckily, I have great friends. All through the day, even though they had no clue of what was going, my friends reached out to me. The drunk blond, the other blond, my bestie, Whorenzo, the Argentinian, the Brother, my Italian boyfriend, BV, my many Frenchies, the list goes on. None spent money on flowers; none sent me candies; none fed me a romantic meal. They texted, pinged, or called... just to tell me that they were thinking of me. That's what Vday should be about, not how much money you can spend to prove your love. \n\nThank you to those that had to listen to me bemoan my circumstances. And many thanks to my siblings, who also had to endure the constant harassment from the ex. \n\nTo end the night, I got a simple little text from friends. A virtual hug from Theron, Debbie, and Keane. Just out of the blue. See how lucky I am? \n\nTo that end, I would love to take all my little valentines out to CREAM. Choose your cookies, choose your ice cream, they put it all together to create a little love. A simple token of my affection, merci mon amis. \n\nCookies Rule Everything Around Me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
