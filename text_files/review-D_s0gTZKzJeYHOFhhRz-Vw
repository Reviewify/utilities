It could be the subconscious fear that I would become a crocodile  meal, instead of having a meal at the Crocodile. But it was REALLY good. I ordered the jambalaya fettuccine, and it was quite possibly the best food that bears the name jambalaya since Lyndon Johnson. My friend's angel hair w/ shrimps was very good too (according to her). The waiter was nice and friendly. The bread was fresh off the oven and very tasty.  Located right on a trendy spot off Lake Ave., you feel \"wrapped\" in a cozy corner.  They could call it \"A Crocodile's Hug\" to remedy the fear factor, whatdya say?", "business_id": "i4OGo_3rSmgW8ze9AiHB1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-07", "type": "review"}
