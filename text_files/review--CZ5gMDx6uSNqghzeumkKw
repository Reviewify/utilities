This is a secret coffee shop in Westwood that not many people know about!  (It's next to Acapulco.)\n\nWhen I think of Espresso Profeta, I think: low key, vines, chic, small, honest, real coffee cups, and bold coffee.  \n\nThey have a cute outdoor patio area with vines all around, and the indoor area is circular with modern geometric paintings.  People are there to chat, or work on some studying.  The vibe is young, private, and leisurely.  Am I doing a good job of describing the mood of the cafe right now?  \n\nAlthough my coffee had some weird things in it twice, I'd still return to Profeta because the mood of this place, and the hard-working honest baristas.  (:\n\nIMPORTANT!  They have wi-fi, but NO PLUGS.  :'(  The most inconvenient part of Profeta.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7MtJs6pZ4uQ4ZdVh4sJMsQ"}
