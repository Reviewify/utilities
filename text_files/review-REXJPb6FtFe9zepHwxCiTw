At my sisters recommendation, I got the garlic bread and one of the salads.  It was pretty good and fresh.  Great prices.  The service was okay.  My sister got her lasagna (that was obviously just microwaved) probably 20 minutes after the rest of us (party of 10) got our food.  That's not okay.  Would've gotten 3 stars for food and price if the service hadn't been so bad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-b_a8H2CAQhOzy6ErVHbmQ"}
