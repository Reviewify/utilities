I went yesterday for a business lunch and had the tuna tartar, which was fantastic!  My fellow diners had the soup special and the bib salad for starters, and it was commented that it was probably the best bowl of soup they have ever eaten.  For my entree I had the chopped salad with grilled chicken (trying to be good) and it was excellent.  The chicken was warm, which I love, and cooked perfectly.  Other favorites here include the tomato soup (OMG!), risotto with sea scallops, and any fish dish on the menu.  Service is always fantastic, the food is always delicious, and the presentation is always impeccable.  Really, this is one of my favorite spots in Providence.  If you haven't been, it's worth a visit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-_FvwOM3_wku2zHiLjibgg"}
