This place is a disaster. Before going to Chocolat, I asked friends in the area for their opinion & they all said 'Ehh'. I went in with average expectations, that declined as the night went on. The waiter was amazing - very attentive and helpful, but the food was a major let-down, fail. . We decided to go with the best selling appetizer - the Sesame Calamari & it was a huge disappointment. The calamari itself wasn't breaded - I should have taken a picture. For a main course, I went with the lobster & crab ravioli --- a greater disappointment. I truly believe the restaurant purchases it from Trader Joe's. It is the same thing if not worse. Definitely not worth the $24. My boyfriend went with a turkey burger that he ended up sending back. It was horrible & he is not anywhere close to a picky eater. My friend ordered the peach arugula salad & ended up getting pears instead of peaches (because they ran out). This place needs to close and re-open with new management & cooking staff. I strongly advise you to go to another restaurant. A pitcher of Sangria is $30 and the fruit isn't fresh. The whole entire restaurant is a joke! I felt majority of the food was frozen and not fresh. Shame on YOU, Chocolat. The quality of food doesn't warrant the menu price point.
