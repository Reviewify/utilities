Same location - just bigger, more seating to accommodate their popularity, and possibly more staff?  \n\nNot much has seemed to change with their food, so you can expect the same quality and taste you're accustomed to.  4 - 5 different banchan dishes.  But now that I've tried some of their other dishes, I've noticed some short cuts they've taken.   \n\nRegardless, this is a great option if you're hanging out the Ave.  I would never pretend to say that this is some of the best, but it is satisfying if you want your Korean food fix and you're in the area. \n\nFYI: There is a 50 cent charge on all purchases under $15 if you want to pay by card.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFzF3dcRKGcziTf4KT0Skw"}
