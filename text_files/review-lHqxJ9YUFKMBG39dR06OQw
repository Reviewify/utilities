Overall, I'm pretty disappointed. Compared the Metrosport, the store was a lot more crowded with stuff, the staff much less helpful. The guy who was not actually helping me had some decent recommendations and experience to draw on, but the girl who was actually helping me was useless. She didn't know prices, selection, anything about how the models of shoes have changed (e.g. why is this model different from that one), or what to recommend for me. She didn't even help me lace up the shoes, size me or anything. Selection of sizes was meh (they were lacking in half sizes and wider shoes). I actually found something I liked in the discount rack (it was old merchandise left by Metrosport). I asked for a bit more of a discount given it was the model \"2\" of the shoe and the current model is \"7\" (meaning it had to be from probably before I was born...) and they wouldn't budge. I thanked them, went home and bought what I wanted in the size I wanted for cheaper on Zappos. Next time I'll go to Zappos or to The Runner's High (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleet-feet-sports---the-runners-high-menlo-park).", "business_id": "KzftOY3nG0OXXeMac8jcHw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-05", "type": "review"}
