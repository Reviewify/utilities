Old advertisements, book covers, and dolls are scattered all around. While I thought it would be cute, it actually goes a little too over-the-top. I thought the food was great though! They make their own bread. I got eggs, potatoes, and toast, and the toast was a good 2 inches thick! The potatoes have some spice to them, so they have an interesting kick. The place wasn't too crowded, though we got there just before lunch, and when lunchtime rolled around, it did get a little busy, but not too bad. Our waiter was a bit neglectful though. He never came by to offer refills on our coffee. Overall though, I would definitely go back!", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-16", "type": "review"}
