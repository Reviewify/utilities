Last few times I notices that the employees were all speaking spanish among themselves- no habla english.  I think it's great to be bilingual, especially here BUT I'd hope the primary language would be english with a mostly english speaking clientele.  Was there yesterday and the cashier did not speak english AT ALL.  Just a very few words.  I don't speak spanish and she kept trying to talk to me in spanish. Had to call someone over to translate because I had a simple question.  I was super annoyed by that.  Cashiers in american stores should be able to communicate with their customers in english.", "business_id": "GtYFucBBjN4rso0P5mcPOw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-04", "type": "review"}
