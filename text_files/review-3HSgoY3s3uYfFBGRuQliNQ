They are FAST, not matter how long the lines are. You wont spend more than 5 minutes there IF you dont want too. See my Bellevue Chipotle review if you want to see what I eat. This is the perfect place for a college campus because I like to get my burrito to go, and eat it in class. I feel bad for the people around me in class because they have to sit around and smell my yummy burrito! Parking is a little annoying because they only have two spots in the back where the trash cans are. Basically you have to pay for street parking. If I'm just getting to go, I like to park at the 3 minute load/unload spot accross the street on Brooklyn. It's just enough parking time for you to get your food and go!", "business_id": "wE-gNIBhkmxDv5f50rRX7Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-28", "type": "review"}
