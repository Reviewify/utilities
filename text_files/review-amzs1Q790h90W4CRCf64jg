I bought \"Angels on Bare Skin\" (a facewash), and every time I used it it broke me out.  I normally almost never get pimples (if I do just one or two), at least not since I was in high school.  Maybe it's possible that I got a bad batch, but at any rate it's sitting on my desk right now collecting dust and I think maybe I'll give it to my little sister when I go home for Christmas in case her skin type works well with it.  The other product I bought was the Godiva shampoo bar.  It smells so nice and worked super well the first few times, then after that, it gave me dandruff (too drying perhaps?).  I never get dandruff either.  As soon as I discontinued using it the problem went away.  Maybe there are better products from Lush, but since it's expensive, I'm not willing to plunk down money to try another product.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bYVgIoLWn0Ya8-K4ERoI4Q"}
