It is very clean, not to mention, I love Rice Village.  If you like places like Blow-Dry Bar...you will like this place WAY more.  Staff is professional...and it is hip.  They offer a beverage with services, music is good and you can even watch a movie while getting your hair done!  Oh...did I mention they have the latest styles, products, etc from Paris???", "business_id": "rsQgPm-8lWJHIwaz31bCqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-12", "type": "review"}
