I had the citrus freeze, half lemon and half orange. The orange freeze is so fruity and you can tell they use fresh oj! The owner was really nice and took the time to tell me how the ice is made. If you've ever had Merlino's (now Mr. Pickles) on Folsom Boulevard in Sacramento, this place is even better! This is so far my favorite place in Cali for Italian ice!", "business_id": "R2HX_E2iD7nohZE64O1Bqw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-22", "type": "review"}
