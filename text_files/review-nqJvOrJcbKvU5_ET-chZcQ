Just like all my other experiences at Kimpton Hotels, I was satisfied. The wine reception each night was awesome. They also had cookies and other sweets. The lobby had coffee, tea, and water in the morning. The staff was great. With 4 girls in the room we had called numerous times to the front desk for everything from a razor to a curling iron. They had it all. They were so quick bringing everything up to the room, too. Cons: Housekeeping did not clean up our empty pizza boxes in the room. Granted, the room was a mess because of 4 girls getting ready, luggages, etc etc. but I expect trash to be thrown away and beds to be made at the least. There are no vending machines, just the pricey minibar in the room which is tempting at 2am even given the price. Also, it was hard to hail a cab out front and the conceirge wasn't always available. The location was decent, short cab ride from downtown. Grocery store, some restaurants/bars close by. Daiquari bar across the street has cheap, strong drinks and outdoor seating. The MARTA is in walking distance to the hotel (even with luggage) and the ride to the airport was only about $2.", "business_id": "FJfD6FYs8wgrl_IUsKTsfw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-05", "type": "review"}
