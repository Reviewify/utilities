The cubed beef steak with green beans is panty-dropping delicious. Also love the lemongrass tofu, the beef pho, the Singaporean noodles, the claypot rice, the curries...\n\nPrices are reasonable for lunch, but go up a bit for dinner. It's okay if you want a nicer dinner with friends but nothing too fancy. Plenty of seating, and the waiter is kickass awesome. He's funny, prompt, and polite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lWG0hyFKIgZISbZkEfMVsQ"}
