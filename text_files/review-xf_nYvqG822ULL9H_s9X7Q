I was actually surprised that Jessika picked this place, since she hates Chinese food. But this is different than what you might usually find. The dishes actually tasted more Taiwanese than anything else I've tried before. For a party of five, we had no wait on a Friday night! \n\nShe was quite fascinated with the background of the food in the introduction of the menu. For dishes, we had the Shogo Nurmtak (appetizer) , Chhasha Curry (chicken), Langsha Duluma (beef), Langsha Momo (steamed dumplings), Gonga Deyngo (pork fried rice). All the descriptions and other choices are in menu pages, so be sure to check that out! All in all, the food was very tasty and well seasoned. It is not greasy at all and not the kind of food that you would regret eating afterwards. Darn the Chinese for their unruly occupation!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HxegWRjhi7m73mXRI8qQIg"}
