My husband's company had their holiday party here and WWT was very accommodating. We had about 20 people and many of us had never been. We were in for a treat. We had a blast. The beer flowed quickly, the staff were all nice and the improv was hilarious. I left thinking, \"we've gotta come here more often.\" So yeah, great place for a date and a group of friend. Enjoy!", "business_id": "4DIt9z-E4OReC_fooq1odQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-03", "type": "review"}
