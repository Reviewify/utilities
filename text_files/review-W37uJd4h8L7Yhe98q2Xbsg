And it was definitely one of the last places I went before leaving campus after graduation. And I went plenty often in between :) Good for a bagel and coffee, quick snack, or a beer on the outdoor patio. I especially love the vegetarian bagel (bagel with veggie cream cheese, tomato, melted muenster cheese) and the hot chocolate made with coffee.", "business_id": "uv7n9Af48hRVlpLNojvi7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-19", "type": "review"}
