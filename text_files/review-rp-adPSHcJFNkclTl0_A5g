I prefer the indoor ones like Roseville and Valley Fair, but when thirsty, beggars can't be choosy. \n\nI went to this cafe Saturday afternoon since the wife and I were shopping next door at Crate & Barrel. It was a warm humid day, but cooler than the previous ones. They had a large green umbrella pitched out in front of the cashier, I suppose just in case the weather decided to pull a fast one. The snacks and desserts were fully stocked in the clear display case, and looked very inviting to eat. I had to hold back and ordered a Enorme Pomegranate Lemonade. Priced at $3.90, but the cup was jam packed with ice. By the time we finished sharing the cup, it was consumed in less than 10 minutes. The lemonade was tart, tasted great, and soothed my thirst. They don't make smoothie drinks and I hope they could integrate more selections with their menu in the future.\n\nIf only the cashier and staff would smile more. If they did, I would feel more inclined to buy something more. Yet, I felt like they were robots with expressionless faces. If you want a great tasting drink, this is your place. I saw the barista pulling an espresso shot and overfilling the dispenser, so I know you'll get a strong espresso beverage. If you want a happy atmosphere, I usually have a great experience from Valley Fair!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6hfzW9oYtVdFC7HCpY8Mag"}
