Roasted Almond Oatmeal . a bit to sweet It starts out tasting toasty, almost smoky, like the salted almonds that always disappear first from a can of mixed nuts. But almost immediately that gives way to a sweeter, almost syrupy flavor, closer to almond extract or amaretto liqueur. What it tastes most like are those Toasted Almond ice-cream bars you'd buy from the Mister Softee truck as a kid, which you still remember fondly, even though when you occasionally buy one nowadays it's never the same.  Maybe they used to make them differently, or maybe it's just that you're grown up now and can't really handle a lot of sugar/dairy, but at some point Toasted Almond bars started evoking a brick of Elmer's glue covered in dust rather than the sweet summer freedom of your youth. Now, however, Corner Bakery has returned to you a small piece of that lost deliciousness, magically refashioned into a form that fits in with your healthy-breakfast-eating lifestyle. You can eat it  with your morning coffee at your desk job and pretend you are 10 years old, it's October, and there's nowhere you have to be.", "business_id": "sx_tne-DYkLyW5wir_c4Ag", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-22", "type": "review"}
