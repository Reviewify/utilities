I wasn't paying attention honestly... Second visit: Apple pie a la cold stone. Employee was texting and on phone while taking my order. couldn't hear my questions cuz she was on the phone! This was a seriously disappointing visit to my local ice cream hub. Instead of making you read a crap-ton load of text, here is my review in bullet form: - Took forever with previous customer - Employee was texting while trying to take my order, and was on the phone while trying to listen to my question on another option - They ran out of Oreos. How the frakk do you run out of Oreos when half your menu of specialties has the cookie as an ingredient?! My friend and I came to the conclusion that she was just too lazy to go grab another box of Oreos from the back - The apple pie specialty I requested was not mixed well at all; all of the caramel was stuck to the bottom and the apple chunks were huddled in one corner of the cup. I would love nothing more than to give this place one star, but my first excellent visit does not warrant such a low score. I just hope no one else visits on a weekday afternoon and receives the same sub-par service.", "business_id": "jtlkMSgiv6AwGXd8vhJU-A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-03", "type": "review"}
