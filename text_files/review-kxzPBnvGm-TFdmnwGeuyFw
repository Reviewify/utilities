Le petite cheval is a great deal for the price, which is rock bottom.  I went here recently with a friend, though the lunch was served in warmers, it was still fresh and had clearly not been sitting for hours.  The beef sandwich is a great deal at 3.50, yeah 3.50.  In this day and age its a hard price to beat for lunch, geez my morning bagel cost more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lWG0hyFKIgZISbZkEfMVsQ"}
