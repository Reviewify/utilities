The train station is gorgeous, and the interior has an old fashioned charm. It's a great place to have a quiet, peaceful dinner. \n\nThe food is very good, and worth the price. I had one of their fish dishes, which was excellent. My husband had the duck, which he enjoyed. Being a fan of G&Ts I had one - they have a solid selection of gin and don't go heavy on the tonic. Always a good thing. \n\nThe waitstaff are trained old school - polite, quiet, and reserved. They know just when to take your order and your plate, and when to ask if you'd like another drink. \n\nI enjoyed myself so much that I have made reservations for an upcoming wedding celebration.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ymDHWlqyOi0FgrSLo1jpkg"}
