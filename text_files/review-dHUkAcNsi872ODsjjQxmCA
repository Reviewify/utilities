So good. I can't think about it. Oh my god. After I write this review I am going to cook a pound of bacon eat some apple pie, which I just brought back from Upstate, and and when I'm done, I'll probably still want to go to Kitchenette. Nothing compares. \n\nOk, Good Enough To Eat compares and is better, but this place is really, really good! They're also different; Kitchenette is a little more austere. They're in different neighborhoods... whatever.\n\nAnyway, everything here has a little delicious hint of grease in it. In a good way. I get a bacon omelette w/extra bacon and a side of bacon. No regrets. \n\nOh and GUESS WHAT? This is really the awesome part: they deliver to the Columbia area. Pretty far south, actually. They used to get me on 111th, which is awesome given the relative lack of good food options immediately south of Columbia (Community being a notable exception), it was a godsend; I ordered from them dozens of times a year, and was always surprising people: \n\nFriend: WAIT THEY DELIVER TO 113st? \nMe: Duh! \nFriend: WHY HAVE I BEEN ORDERING FROM DELUXE? WHYYYYY?!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg"}
