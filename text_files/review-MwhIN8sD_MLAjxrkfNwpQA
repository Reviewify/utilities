A lot has changed, including the decor and the food, but the one thing that's stayed the same is the hot, skinny waitresses. A group of us celebrated a birthday and a welcome back (for a friend who never actually left, long story) on Friday. We met up here because it's our old stomping grounds and most of the party people work at UCLA. We were ghetto enough to bring our own giant cake and they were cool with that. We took essentially every cocktail table in a 25-foot radius and they were cool with that. We split the $$$$ check on half a dozen credit cards and they were cool with that. Honestly, for a place that is supposed to be upscale and pretentious, they let us get away with being low-class drunks. Awesome! I didn't see anyone famous this time, but this used to be a hot place to see stars. Our group has seen Kevin Spacey, Marisa Tomei, and my boyfriend George Clooney there at various times. I have to say it was a lot better before, but that's probably because a friend had a government account there and since he never paid for a room, he always paid for drinks. This particular visit may in fact have been the first time I ever paid for anything at the bar. Parking is ridiculously expensive (it's actually $20 to valet on a Friday night) but there's a $6 lot one block south on Weyburn and Hilgard.", "business_id": "YVaA9PgC1DZ3or4aWa90IQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-04-18", "type": "review"}
