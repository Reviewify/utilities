I wish I had known about the renter's block, it is a great deal, but I didn't find out about it until i was too close to graduation.  The place has every type of movie you can imagine, and their prices are at least half of Blockbuster. The one reason it didn't get five stars is for the people who work there.  They are sometimes friendly, sometimes rude, and always very slow.  They hire a bunch of artsy campus kids who are more interested in movies than customer service.", "business_id": "9SJ5sTileHeLXVMJrQiEDQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-24", "type": "review"}
