The flat bread is a delicious reminder of naan.  The beef dishes were amazing.  I would give this place a five star rating if I didn't feel that the oil content was a bit overwhelming. Meal are hearty (you'll prob have leftovers.)  Wait staff is extremely helpful with suggestions. One of the best meals I've ever had in Boston!", "business_id": "HxegWRjhi7m73mXRI8qQIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-07", "type": "review"}
