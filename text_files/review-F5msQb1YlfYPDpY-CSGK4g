The flat bread is a delicious reminder of naan.  The beef dishes were amazing.  I would give this place a five star rating if I didn't feel that the oil content was a bit overwhelming.\n\nMeal are hearty (you'll prob have leftovers.)  Wait staff is extremely helpful with suggestions.\n\nOne of the best meals I've ever had in Boston!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HxegWRjhi7m73mXRI8qQIg"}
