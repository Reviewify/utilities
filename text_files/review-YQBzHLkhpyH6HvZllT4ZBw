I hope that isn't the case because my experience at NuLife will keep me coming back. I needed to have my comforter cleaned and I initially to it to Colonial Cleaners, but they wouldn't do it and told my to wash it at home. If it was possible, I would have been doing that in the first place. That ended up working to my advantage because I found myself at NuLife. The woman behind the counter was super sweet and couldn't believe I was turned away beforehand. I dropped it off on a Thursday and told her I was in no rush for it to be done so she told me to pick it up on the following Tuesday. I didn't ask for a quote but I'm sure she would have given me one. Just the comforter  ended up costing $50 which I thought was kind of high though I don't remember how much it cost before because we had several different items we took with it. It was worth it, whatever the cost. They did a great job with it, the staff were friendly and its supporting a small, local business.", "business_id": "9XTOyc6w0g-0WIWAiECOuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-13", "type": "review"}
