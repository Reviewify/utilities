Seems to fit better.  Anywho, I haven't had a burger, but I am in LOVE with the Napa Chicken and the LA Chicken.  Both are delicious.  And the sweet potato fries with horseradish honey mustard dipping sauce are the best I've had.  Good place for lunch or even casual dinner, but don't go if you're in a hurry.  Even if you call ahead, plan to wait at least 10 minutes for your order.  Worth it, if you ask me :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "csS_UrBujOvjASbX3gLW7w"}
