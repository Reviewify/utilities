One of the nice things is that the buffet food is out in small-to-medium size plates right near the cooking station. This ensures that turnaround is fast, food is fresh and warm (or cold if it's supposed to be) and never stale.  Chefs behind the counter were also friendly and seemed to be in a good mood.  Good selection of foods and coffee refills came regularly. Very crowded but that's to be expected for Sunday Brunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RThn3_Y6qN8MsqZKWa6WyQ"}
