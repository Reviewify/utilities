While we were standing outside waiting for the doors to open I was  reminiscing about my senior prom being held at the Fox and how I wasn't able to attend. One of the workers overheard and offered to give us a tour as they were setting up for a prom that night.  We were escorted to the ballroom and while the band was practicing my boyfriend and I danced alone on the dance floor.  It was such an unexpected treat and a memory I will cherish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SxtcekmS_EvKhOXWNAA3Mw"}
