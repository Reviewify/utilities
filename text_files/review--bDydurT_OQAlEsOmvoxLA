It was a weekend afternoon so we didn't face what I hear is the usual crush of people.   PROs: - One of my friends was visiting from Italy and tells me that the pizza at The Porch is the closest he's had to northern Italian pizza EVER in the US.   I guess that's a good thing if you're looking for authentic Italian pizza.   I enjoyed the pizza; thin, crispy crust and NOT overloaded with toppings.   - The sandwich and salad I had was fresh and crisp. - The service was okay; friendly and prompt but the server did disappear and not check back after we had our entrees. CONs: - Out of several menu items on both visits, but that could be cost of serving fresh food. I'll be back.  It's good to have a comfortable place like The Porch so close by.", "business_id": "Eg_M8eeu9SDEdbP7iUmVbQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-12", "type": "review"}
