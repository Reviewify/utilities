Had my best experience this past weekend, as my homegirl decided she wanted be a veggie for the day and we had a fantastic combo of vegetarian plates.  Man, I love stuff with bebere sauce.  \n\nThe only bad thing was the same as my last time, the terrible service.  They weren't understaffed that night, Zoma is only SO big, but these ladies never looked back over at our table, which got annoying very quickly.  Good service would make me go back to a place before great food, so unless someone else wants to go, I don't know the next time I'll be back at Zoma, unfortunately.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg"}
