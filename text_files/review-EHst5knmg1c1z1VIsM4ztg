They are little bit more pricey than some other places, but you get your money worth here and the service is always good.  The place is crowded at lunch time so get here early - full of business types and UCSD college kids.  The Pho broth is great and I typically get it with brisket and rare steak.  I love the BBQ Pork sandwich though and it is enormous -and a bit of an American sized take on the traditional.   The parking is the worst thing about this place, it is limited and the lot is always packed.  If you go during off peak hours it won't be a problem, but then again I eat lunch at lunchtime and dinner and dinnertime.  I also recommend the vietnamese spring rolls with pork or the egg rolls.  The seating is tight and a lot of the time you sit family style with another group of folks at your table.  They don't let you split the bill on more than one card! So be prepared for that!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MeSeqjo33YKxfqY1oKxOSg"}
