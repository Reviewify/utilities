We decided it would be fun to go back to one of our old haunts - Chano's!  Well as my buddy Trent would say, \"you're growns up, and you're growns up, and you're growns up!\"  Sadly for them my taste buds have moved on, but the experience was the same...I think we had the same bum knock on my window begging for money! Of course selectively, stopping at each car that was new and shiny.  We ended up ordering a carnitas taco, pastor taco and a carnitas burrito. All were pretty mediocre and flavorless, however their red sauce gives it a nice kick!  Will I be back? Probably not, but it was nice to go back to my hood! Chano's is an institution and will continue to be one for all the USC kids to come. Especially if they need to soak up all those drinks from a night of partying. Hey, maybe that's why it isn't as good anymore? : )", "business_id": "m8oV_h-OV3AoPicvieCJEQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}
