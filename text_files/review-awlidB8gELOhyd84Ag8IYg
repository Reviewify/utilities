I have tried several places in the greater LA area and it were so-so. I did not see the fusion and other influences these shows talked about. So a couple of weeks ago I was reading the LA Times and they talked about this restaurant located in a food court/mercado in South Central LA. It sounded good and the word \"fusion\" was mentioned so I went and took my parents to try. This place is great. Yes, it's not the best ambiance but the food is excellent. I had Ahi de Galllina which very different that what I have had before but the flavors were nicely blended. My parents had the Lomo Saltado (my dad wanted a bigger portion , had to tell him this is not Norm's) and the Arroz con Pollo. Both dishes were great and again so different that the Peruvian food we have tasted but you still see the Peruvian influence. My dad and I were still a little hungry so we ordered the ceviche (red snapper) which was pretty good. I have never seen pieces of corn , sweet potato and seaweed in the same plate but hey it worked. Anyways, the prices are more than fair for what you get. Top quality food by quality chefs (great resumes). If this restaurant was on the Westside they would easy get double the price for these wonderful dishes.", "business_id": "3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-27", "type": "review"}
