The two women who work at the pharmacy are so nice and personable, they'll know you by name after you've been there two or three times.  Another man consistently works the register. It is no refreshing to have a local pharmacy with people who know your name and needs.  The only downfall is they close somewhat on the early side; however, they are so accommodating that it is of no matter.", "business_id": "zBsAe3jj1MgtRKdA1zIjtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-23", "type": "review"}
