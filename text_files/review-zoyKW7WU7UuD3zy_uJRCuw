(The menu is in a freaking 3-RING BINDER, ya'll.  Pearl tea is SRS BSNS here.)  The tapioca pearls are the softest I've ever had, and I think I love them that way. The \"store\" portion of this place made me squeal like a 12-year-old fangirl.  I am not ashamed to admit it.  For all that I am essentially a goth at heart, I still love diminutive adorable things.  The store is packed full of Domokun, Totoro, Spooky Bear, and San-x stuff, among others.", "business_id": "iNVDkapV60vH3KIS7kYDDA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-25", "type": "review"}
