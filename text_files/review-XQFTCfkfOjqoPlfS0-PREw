Nothing is as good of a value in this world than their cookie sandwiches.  \n\n$1.50 is the cost (which is up from their original $1 pricetag).  \n\nTheir cookies are amazingly fresh and delicious.  Their ice creams are decadent and perfect.  The combining of the two creates an experience you will never forget.  It is best ice cream sandwich you will ever have and you will absolutely never pay less for one of its quality.  \n\nStop reading this review and go there, immediately!", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
