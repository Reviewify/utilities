I used to donate regularly every quarter (I've donated so many times at UCLA, I have a pin! 1 gallon donated, baby!) \n\nThe staff who work here are awesome and super nice. The chairs, as stated, are as comfortable as can be and the room is always the perfect temperature. You get to eat Diddy Riese cookies and drink out of a juice box after you're done.\n\n...And best of all? If you work for UCLA, you get 4 hours pay every time you donate! Whoo to money for doing a good thing to begin with!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hC5-IFAE5U2CObQmivGesQ"}
