I came here 3 times already and was never disappointed. Here are my favorites: \n\nThe lab burger: so juicy and flavorful, it's hard not to finish the whole thing. The meat was well seasoned and the bacon, smokey cheese and avocado threw the whole thing together.\n\nBuffalo Chicken Quesadilla: These were bomb!! I never had such a kick to a quesadilla but the buffalo chicken was so delicious embedded within the cheese. Definitely not short on the marinating.\n\nSpinach artichoke dip: YUMMM! Served with warm pita, the dip was nice and creamy and had plenty of spinach and artichoke.\n\nI came here for a couple of hosted events and each time, I was very satisfied with the food. I definitely want to come back here during happy hour!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YvSqThnZr9gVfeJNnleQBA"}
