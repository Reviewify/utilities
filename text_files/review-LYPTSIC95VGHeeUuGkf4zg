I came here 3 times already and was never disappointed. Here are my favorites: The lab burger: so juicy and flavorful, it's hard not to finish the whole thing. The meat was well seasoned and the bacon, smokey cheese and avocado threw the whole thing together. Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla: These were bomb!! I never had such a kick to a quesadilla but the buffalo chicken was so delicious embedded within the cheese. Definitely not short on the marinating. Spinach artichoke dip: YUMMM! Served with warm pita, the dip was nice and creamy and had plenty of spinach and artichoke. I came here for a couple of hosted events and each time, I was very satisfied with the food. I definitely want to come back here during happy hour!", "business_id": "YvSqThnZr9gVfeJNnleQBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-08", "type": "review"}
