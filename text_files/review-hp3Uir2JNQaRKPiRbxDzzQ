I've been to this place several times in the past year and always enjoyed the food. Inexpensive and yummy. My favorite is #52 Pineapple Curry -- it has 4 different types of proteins (different meat substitutes) and all are delicious. That and add the spicy noodle dish, you can't go wrong.", "business_id": "Y7ehe7zpS4zf8SjOltf9sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}
