The drive from 24 to the nature area is awesome and has some nice views too. When my kids were younger, they loved this place for the petting zoo experience. Now as they grow older, we enjoy the hikes from the Tilden Nature Area to the top of the hills. The round trip is 4 miles and not that strenuous but has pretty views of the bay.\n\nOne of the lesser known facts: The visitor center is beautiful with great exhibits and the rangers have a snake and some tarantulas. 6 yrs+ kids love to watch these creepy crawlies and get completely engrossed in their stories. I took a bunch of kids (10 kids) + 5 adults with me and had called ahead. The rangers gladly arranged a nature talk!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RYy2c4Z92gClq8EzjHdMiw"}
