When I first came to Cal, I needed to find a Mexican place that could compare to my love for King Taco back home in So Cal... La Burrita definitely did not replace my love, but it did find a way to be appealing and a way to keep me a frequent customer. My favorite food item here are there \"Tacos Rancheros.\" You get three tacos, your choice of meat, and a side of chips. They're delicious. I would add some lime and get their green sauce. Perfect lunch meal. What else is great about La Burrita? Well, aside from the friendly staff, it's a fantastic late night food stop. Leave the bar, arrive and order, and then FEAST! Anyone remotely tipsy, or beyond that point will most definitely enjoy their late night adventure into this place. All in all, it's one of my Berkeley staples. It doesn't get five stars because it's not a stellar place, but it is great, and good, and the service is great!", "business_id": "q33FT8iYvU2UUbJuiEQWUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-21", "type": "review"}
