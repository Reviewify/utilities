That being said...give me a cupcake from Cupcake Royale instead...I really like their cupcakes but the one hold up for me is that they are always too moist! The cupcakes (no matter what the flavor) have always had their \"tops\" fall off as I've taken them out of the box. The flavors are there and it certainly tastes yummy, but for me the cupcake is about savoring the morsels and picking back its base paper. That rarely happens for me when I get a cupcake from Trophy. The service is good and the location is definitely convenient. The parking is available when you go to U-Village (assuming it isn't the holiday season). All in all not that bad of a place to grab a cupcake if you are in a hurry and in the neighborhood, if not, make the trek to Cupcake Royale.", "business_id": "I1eS83hJ5wIEUYN_m4P0jA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-12", "type": "review"}
