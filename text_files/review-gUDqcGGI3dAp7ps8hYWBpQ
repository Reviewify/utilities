The pain was the worse I have ever had in my life, worse than cancer itself at its worst. I ended up in the hospital numerous times from Lorenz's surgery in excruciating pain, throwing up, dying of pain, not even being able to drink water. I asked Lorenz to fix it, he said he would do the complete surgery for cash only of which I did not have. The Director of the Plastic Surgical Department said I needed the same surgery along with the missing part Lorenz did not do-- done all over again. He then proceeded to bill my insurance for the same surgery all over again. Lorenz's previous instructor tried calling Lorenz numerous times about this and Lorenz refused to call him back and talk to him. After almost 3 years of excruciating pain, hospitalizations, starvation's, dehydration's, loss of being able to go to the bathroom normally from Lorenz's surgery, Lorenz's previous instructor then partially fixed Lorenz's damage leaving permanent disfigurements and permanent going to the bathroom normally health crisis's -- all  of which are due to Lorenz's  surgical damages.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f0O8GX7JjBuDMrmP7lVkYA"}
