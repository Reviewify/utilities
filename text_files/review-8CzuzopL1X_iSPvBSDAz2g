SO frustrating. The first time I went, I was blown away by their ordering process and the amount of options, especially for a vegetarian (like myself). Not only that, but for the size of my sandwich and how it tasted, the $5.75 (including tax) was totally worth it. I got the Tomato/Avocado sandwich with a bunch of veggies on top, and it was stuffed and huge and delicious. The service was wonderful as well. The second time, I ordered the EXACT same sandwich and, get this, there was no AVOCADO on my Tomato/AVOCADO sandwich, or half of the other toppings I asked for. And there was barely anything in the bread. Maybe a pinch of lettuce. My friend's sandwich was less than satisfactory as well.  One more visit will make or break this place for me. I hope the next time is better, but I'm much more hesitant to spend my money there to find out.", "business_id": "5ph4kLeJb9v5hl71SyVv8Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-21", "type": "review"}
