I had a fall injury during Oct '11 that required a partial meniscus removal. So I'm going to do some further Doctor Grading here: Bedside manner = A++ Nurses who assist him = A++++ Prioritizing = A+++ Rescheduling Surgery (in advance) = B- When my prior Doc said I required knee surgery I sought out a second opinion and found Dr. King through a dear friend who used him 2x with GR8 success on her ankles. I did end up being rescheduled 5X (1X me and 4X Dr. King) and it might have had something to do with NFL Season!? LOL I realized (after viewing PICS in his ofc) that there probably higher priorities than me. Dont get me wrong at that time I was frustrated and 2 reschedules from the Surgery Center in Fremont were due to \"safety precautions.\" My pre-op tests did not pan out! Dr. King likes to be safe when it comes to his patients vs. kill them.... I agreed! LOL I'm glad I waited as POST OP = Knee operates at conditions that are conducive to being back to normal in the FORESEEABLE FUTURE. And I have much less pain today Vs. PRE OP. IMPORTANT NOTE: When there is only one of you and several thousand patients you have to make some priority choices. Sometimes when you see the \"best of the best\" you have to have some patience! UPDATES: 14MAR12; Knee utilization @ 50% Whoohoo! Okay so I still cant work out for 4 hrs every other day on my legs... and progress is happening. No knee pain for 65% of my day and its COLD outside, now thats awesome! Guess I wont be one to tell the weather by my knee joint... cool! BTW: Mild knee tiredness and some discomfort in the late afternoon and evenings.", "business_id": "k0uapEcMDEjcbEWCM_xrjQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-19", "type": "review"}
