Some things here are decent, but in general I think buffet food is not that great because it doesn't taste fresh. This place is also NOT authentic Chinese food. Several of my friends think this place is great and it's real Chinese food, but it's not at all close to real Chinese food! I think this place has the most buffet options out of all other Chinese buffet places in the area. If you want a \"Chinese\" buffet, come here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6CruOxyuBRnJJx3wRu_oMA"}
