I was zoning out in front of my laptop, and what appeared along with one of my favorite gals? Four, delicious, delectable cupcakes from Sprinkles. The lemon coconut was absolutely scrumptious with that homemade-style moist cake and a light and buttery frosting. Obsession worthy, definitely.

You South Bay kids are cupcake crazaa.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-04", "type": "review"}
