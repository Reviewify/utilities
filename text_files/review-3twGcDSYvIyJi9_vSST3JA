To start, the staff was able to accomodate our early check-in. It was a little confusing trying to figure out how to actually get to the hotel from the main road as all turns from Jersey are done from the right and intersections are designed like jug-handles. Bizarre, but par for the course for Jersey. When we finally got in, we had no problem checking in and our room was immaculately clean. The bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was okay. The sink was actually outside of the shower and toilet; very bizarre and causes a germ-y door handle without being able to wash your hands when completing your business with the door closed. I don't understand how or why, but our room had a strong scent of toothpaste. Once again, bizarre. My only gripe was on the day of our check-out, housekeeping staff came by at 8:30 a.m. Super early for most hotels. I'm not sure if I know what the \"Forrestal Village\" is around the area- it looks like a bunch of overpriced boutiques in a Main Street charm area, just with a lot of trees. For reference, we left the hotel around 10:30 on a weekday morning and was in Manhattan in just about an hour.", "business_id": "oVse63-Kc1elHM9pqaaacQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-08", "type": "review"}
