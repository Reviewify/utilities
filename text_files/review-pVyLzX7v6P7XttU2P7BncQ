Beats me. Princetonians are typically old-moneyed so its really unnecessary, in my opinion.\n\nChicken parm's the good one but i'd always get #9 cos i am crazy about tuna sandwiches. And they really do pile on the tuna. Chicken steak's only ok though and i wouldn't recommend it especially when there are other terrific-sounding sandwiches around such as The Sanchez (chicken cutlet with mozzarella sticks and fries in special Sanchez sauce), which could be made extra dirty on request.\n\nAt first,i was intimidated by the people here. They are the no-nonsense type who just want to assemble your sandwich quick and get the line moving. but they turned out to be quite courteous.\n\nAnd to help fight off the winter blues, they also have a soup and stew of the say, for $1.50 and $2 respectively. the food here might not be mind blowing (good nonetheless), but the prices are.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5G0Vy0N4H6c4eIGxb1JPSQ"}
