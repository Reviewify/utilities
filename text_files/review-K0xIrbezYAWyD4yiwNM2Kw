The pizza, THANK GOD, is not bar pies. It's like a neapolitan pizza and it's good. I had their pepperoni, and other meats pizza. I was looking for a good sauce and good crust, but unfortunately I didn't find this. The sauce was very bland, not something that I expect from this type of pizza. Also, the crust was rock hard. Don't get me wrong, hard crust (that's what she said) is good, if cooked properly, but so hard as to not be able to eat it without pulverizing it in a blender or food processor is not good. The meats tasted good and the cheese was nice. I go to school in Amherst, and I haven't been back. I'm not sure I will go back, but maybe it was a fluke.
