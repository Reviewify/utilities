(anyone who likes fish has to try it!) the pines restaurant is a little out of the way for me but that doesn't stop me from going there! it has a view of cayuga lake, i believe they also have outside seating. i would recommend this restaurant to any one.", "business_id": "GFMUL8Z44l1wD7KXop18sA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-11", "type": "review"}
