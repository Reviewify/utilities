Well I actually like the fish sandwich! Comes on a large roll with let, tom, your choice of tarter sauce. Excellent! (anyone who likes fish has to try it!) The Pines Restaurant is a little out of the way for me but that doesn't stop me from going there! It has a view of Cayuga lake, I believe they also have outside seating. I would recommend this Restaurant to any one.", "business_id": "GFMUL8Z44l1wD7KXop18sA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-11", "type": "review"}
