The past two times that I've visited this particular Red Mango, my yogurt and toppings were disappointing. The most recent time was two days ago, during which time I noticed flies in the mandarin oranges and unidentifiable orange mush labeled as mango. I used to WORK at Red Mango and that shit did NOT fly, so I don't know what's wrong with management at the U Village location, but they need to change it. The yogurt tasted old and BELIEVE ME, I know what old Red Mango tastes AND smells like. It was powdery and had a weird after taste and I ended up just throwing it away after salvaging what decent fruit was on it-- basically just raspberries and strawberries, which you really can't mess up (except for the fact that I'm pretty sure the raspberries were unwashed and had little dried leaves in them). I also got mochi, which I used to be completely addicted to, and it was definitely funky. The little pieces were all stuck together and chunky and left a gross feeling in my mouth. Take your business to Bellevue or Pacific Place, where they actually serve you fresh fruit and yogurt.", "business_id": "NhmEVZphPgblvDNZM21hiQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}
