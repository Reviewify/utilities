Despite hearing complaints about the price, I've always found the prices to be more than reasonable given the amount of food provided, which is alot. \n\nIts a bit small so it can get crowded at times but there's always takeout and of course, bubble tea.\n\nDishes that I've always liked and recommend \n-any of the curries, for those afraid of spice the yellow is fairly mild and sweet. I've always liked the red since it was spicy and flavorful \n-basil fried rice \n-mango and sticky rice if available", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pmow7gVnjDbpKIwafYI-XA"}
