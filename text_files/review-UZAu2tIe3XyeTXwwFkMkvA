Despite hearing complaints about the price, I've always found the prices to be more than reasonable given the amount of food provided, which is alot. Its a bit small so it can get crowded at times but there's always takeout and of course, bubble tea. Dishes that I've always liked and recommend -any of the curries, for those afraid of spice the yellow is fairly mild and sweet. I've always liked the red since it was spicy and flavorful -basil fried rice -mango and sticky rice if available", "business_id": "Pmow7gVnjDbpKIwafYI-XA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-30", "type": "review"}
