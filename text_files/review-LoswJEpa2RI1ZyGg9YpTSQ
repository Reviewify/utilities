They have a variety of beers on tap, their bartenders are very nice and fast with drinks, and they make a killer mojito! However in the overall scheme of things, the only thing going for this place is the roof top deck. It's a great atmosphere for bringing a group of people, relaxing and catching up with your friends, but that's about it. The drinks are ok, moderately priced (nothing absurd), but the food is god awful. I've tried this place over and over again hoping that something decent will come out of the kitchen and quite frankly I'd rather starve. Since this place is considered a restaurant & pub, I'm rating a 2-star based on the overall performance and I can say with certainty that I've experienced better. \n\nI've recently changed this rating to a 3 stary bc I don't want people to get the wrong idea. For it's location, drink prices, and roof deck..it's a nice place to go and meet up and they have a ton of TVs so definitely a good time when games are going on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E_vKoJ0zvpfAcEkQGS4d2A"}
