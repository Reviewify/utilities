From the outside, the place is pretty drab (see previous user's comments about thinking the place is closed), but once you enter you feel at home. The inside is wonderfully lit with dim warm light. Red and white decor covers pretty much everything and the atmosphere is relaxed and homey. The smell of garlic and italian spices hits you right away, signaling, \"Italian food is made here\" In keeping with the rustic, homestyle theme, the service is genuine and relaxed. Our waitress warned us that the food takes time after ordering, which was nice. The bread was fresh with hard crunchy crust. I ordered the Lasagna and a side of meatballs. A truly huge portion, the lasagna was delicious. The richness of the cheese was balanced beautifully by the fresh, acidic tomato sauce. The meatballs were flavorful and juicy and similarly drowned in marinara. I was slightly disappointed in the portion size of the side of meatballs; two slightly larger than golf ball sized meatballs left me wanting more. The menu offers many choices of typical Italian fare including pasta, chicken, meat and veal dishes...Speaking of veal, I don't understand the fascination with veal dishes in Italian menus and Guido's is no different. I think there were 6 or 7 veal entrees, so if you don't eat veal (like myself) your meal options will shrink considerably. Overall, I would recommend Guido's very much. Good Food. Good Atmosphere. Great Experience.", "business_id": "qhz-qmRp30-khTbJ3DjnYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-14", "type": "review"}
