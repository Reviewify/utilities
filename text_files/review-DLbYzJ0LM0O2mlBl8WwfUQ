First, I was struck by the atmosphere. Noir has ongoing Mad Men-themed parties, and I couldnt think of a more perfect place for it. I almost expected to see Roger Sterling tucked into a back booth with Jane and a martini! If you like that sort of dark-but-not-too-dark, retro but still modernly cool atmosphere, this is definitely your kind of place.\n\n\nThey have neat drinks, I tried something called the \"Johnny Handsome\" which our waitress recommended after asking what types of liquor I usually like. It was very good, but it was late and I had to work the next day, so I only indulged in one. \n\nAnyways, for the one drink I did have, the quality waitress, the cool atmosphere, and the embrace-ment of Mad Men, I give Noir 5 stars!\n\nPS: I see that Noir views and responds to some of thier reviews...very cool. Nice to know they listen!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HrED44acwUngPkOWS0GUZg"}
