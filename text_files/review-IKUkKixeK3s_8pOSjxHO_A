Their macaroons were bigger and is not as expensive as other places...which is a plus. It was also very soft and chewy and what a macaroon should be...I think they should offer more flavors though. Oh and I tried their lemon bar which I thought was very tarty and sour. It's just the way I like it. \nI also dined in with my friend and had the infamous egg salad sandwich. Usually, I don't prefer mayo in anything but if you go, you must try this sandwich! I like how they cook their eggs and they way they fix it...it's just too delicious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UsrKX2305OkmeI7K7cizjA"}
