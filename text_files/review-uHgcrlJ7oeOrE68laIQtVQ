No, this place doesn't serve Pho, but the seafood and udon noodle soups we ordered got the job done! The broth was piping hot and very flavorful. The seafood was a little tough, and probably continued to cook in the hot soup. Some of the vegetables were speckled, which I surmise would not be the case with fresher veggies. This place is really small. If there are four or fewer of you, and you can snag the (only) table, then you are in business! Otherwise, this place is probably best for quick meals and takeout.", "business_id": "oqZTiKk6OMOHxyWhiQiFtg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-21", "type": "review"}
