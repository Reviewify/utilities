My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and decided to hit two restaurants on consecutive nights.  Bin 54 and Elaines, both based on reviews from yelp.  One was a massive success, the other not so much.  The not so much was Elaines.  Im not even saying Elaines is bad, its ok, but definately not fine dining, and definately not worth the prices they charge.  You can get food like this anywhere.  I just have to wonder, since Elaines is right on Franklin St, are the great reviews coming from college students who have never eaten at better restaurants?  \n\nI also agree with an earlier post that the portions are very small.  When mussels are one of the first ingredients mentioned in a dish, you expect to get more than three.  The highlight of our visit was the Basil Mojito, which we both agreed is fantastic.  I would not go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sY_8iE6vA3mjcrpIKPKwGQ"}
