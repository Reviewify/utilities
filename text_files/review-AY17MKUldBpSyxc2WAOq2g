We were among those crowds, roaming the streets and looking fora place to eat. We were attracted by the menu and decided to give Hemenway's a try.\n\nThe dining room is huge, lively, and noisy. The place was PACKED to the gills by the time we left. Enjoyed the ambience; liked the views from the windows and the giant mural of historic Providence gracing the dining room.\n\nService and the a portion of our meal left much to be desired. We decided to sit in the bar and quickly saw how understaffed the tables were. Service was pokey and inconsistent (they do make a mean Manhattan, though). Dinner salads came with our entree. For the prices they charge and the ambiance they work to create, the salads were poorly made and mediocre at best. They did well with the seafood. My spouse ordered scallops that he decalred were sweet, fresh and perfectly cooked. I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, scrod, and halibut, each with a different sauce. Although the slamon was a bit dry, it was quite good. We shared a piece of key lime pie, delicious.\n\nWith the dining choices in downtown, a number of which are the same price point as Hemenway's, I think we will steer ourselves somewhere else the next time we are in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "afoQr3drIs-0vbh42O0Ewg"}
