Edamame, panko fried oyster, spicy mango tuna roll, crunchy california roll, spicy hamachi roll, halibut ceviche. All good! Jicama in California Roll was a nice touch. Horseradish dipping sauce for oysters (great breading, perfect texture) was excellent, so good that I had to scrape it up with the plantain chips that came, bizarrely, with the ceviche. Service was fine, presentation was gorgeous. Space is hotel-sleek but tasteful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9aEtX7MDFjEtm5ySOViRUw"}
