The decor of the restaurant was sophisticated and 1st class all-around. I can picture this place being located in the trendiest spots in NY or LA. The bar in the front was spectacular; quite a site to see I must say. The wait staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful too.\n\nNow about the food...the food was excellent. High quality and fresh. I had what I'd call the Brazilian buffet (side dishes plus having the meat guy cut the meat at the table). The sides were fresh and tasty and the meat they cut at the table was exceptional. There's a \"meat puck\" located on the table that indicates if you'd like them to continue to come over with more meat. You can flip it to green or red to indicate you'd like more meat or I've had enough respectively. When the waiter was describing how the process worked he mentioned \"if the meat becomes too intense\" flip it to red. I was dining with two other big meat lovers and we laughed at that notion. Boy did we eat those words (literally). 30 minutes later, we were flipping that sucker to red and keeping it there. The meats were so good we couldn't stop eating.\n\nThis is a great restaurant and especially good for groups or business outings. I highly recommend Pampas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}
