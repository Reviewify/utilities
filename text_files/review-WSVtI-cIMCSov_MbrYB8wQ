I was helped by Tracy, who was the assistant store manager. He was so nice and helpful. I came prepared and had my document on a USB in three different formats so it wasn't hard for him to help me either. He printed my document more than once and didn't charge me when the printer messed up. Tracy informed me that USC students get a 5% discount off everything at Office Depot and like 50% off printing! Such a good deal. Should've cost $2.50 for what I printed but it ended up only costing $1.25! :) YAY! Will definitely coming back here if I need to print more things.", "business_id": "2YtT2gVWB6TADE0IXixnZA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-28", "type": "review"}
