I think it's one of the best restaurants in Chapel Hill/Carrboro area, especially if you like fish and for the price.  \n\nMy favorite option is the Seafood Quartet, which lets you sample four of the different fish dishes - everything is always fresh and fantastic. I have yet to try their famed fresh-fish-for-two as it's often sold out, so one day I'll have to take advantage of their offer to call ahead to reserve a fish ahead of time.  \n\nI'm also a huge fan of their desserts.  I mostly recently tried the Chocolate Mousse, which had the an incredible orange flavor from the Triple Sec that completed the dark chocolate beautifully.  The Poached Pear has some dangerously red sauce and difficult-to-divide sorbet, but is worth the risk.  The Bread Pudding can occasionally be dry, but when it's moist, it's fantastic...I'd take my chances and order it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DwYN7mfIN77toOWRV_aj1Q"}
