I even had my wife's birthday party here and managed to buy dinner for six for about 100$. I brought my own wine and cake, and was not charged a corkage fee. I just left a good tip. The food is ok. The meat could be more fresh, as my wife swears the chicken was off one time. The service is fine. I tried to make friends with them in a neighborhoodly way, but they seemed to not remember my party the next time I went. I go here for convenience as I live in Central Square.", "business_id": "3FB30LGJfWUKxRqwXfq9UQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-19", "type": "review"}
