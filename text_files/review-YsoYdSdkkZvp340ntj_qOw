I sat down for lunch first... My tofu stir fry(?) (I forgot what it was called) was pretty good. Service was ok. Heading over to pay, there is Sassy! I've not seen her and her business partner, Sandy, since, like '95-ish. They used to run Thai Kitchen in Skyway (once upon a time, it was more happenin' in the 'hood =p Now it's just Skyway Park Bowl...) and my family went there often. Sassy & Sandy make a great duo. I'll have to come back again sometime. I also like the space; clean, modern and nice.", "business_id": "OursSBHK7kwFEDD91i0o1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-07", "type": "review"}
