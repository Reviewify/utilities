And the stylist seemed put out when I mentioned that I wanted it shorter in back. She seemed in a rush to get me to leave. I won't be going back.\n\n**** EDIT*****\nAlthough I had a negative experience, I was contacted by the salon owner who offered to speak with me about my experience and pay for my next haircut. So even though my service wasn't great that day, it's nice to know that the owner is dedicated to keeping customers happy. Maybe if I hadn't moved I could say more about how service improved.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Sh9deiGIHRzvb0_cLd_aew"}
