But theone dish here that stands out to me are the angel wings :) They are chicken wings that are stuffed with minced chicken and veggies.  For some reason that type of flavor I am unable to find anywhere!  Its really good, ana dpaired along with their fried rice it goes really well. Im not a big of the soup they give in the start of the meal, and their salad is decent, but dry. It seems to be like the bagged salad with the cabbage and dehydrated carrot.  Overall this place is allright, but if I found a better restaurant to satisify my angel wings craving I would probably head there instead!  Their thai iced tea is good too-- for my taste its too much ice (which obviously lessens the quantity you get).  If you want just thai iced tea, your best bet is to hit up mr. noodle a street away-- for 2 bucks you get the equivalent of a large soda... totally worth the walk.", "business_id": "EylmyX5rhmz8zWdrsrNyZg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-24", "type": "review"}
