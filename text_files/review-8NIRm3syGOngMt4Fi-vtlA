Best balls I've ever had ;0) seriously though, did not expect to like these so much.  I ordered Caprese love balls to share with a buddy, and it was the perfect portion.  Regular order is 8 pancake, japanese street food inspired balls the size of italian meatballs. The caprese are a vegetarian version of pancake balls with scallions, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes finished with a basil pesto mayo sauce. Super Yummy!!!  Cool food truck with great 8 track selection, and they had recycling readily available for all the unique canned beverage options like green tea and a coffee drink.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8SqxzaPVVBTIxrbJKZwDxg"}
