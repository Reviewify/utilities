The lamb with balsamic sauce is absolutely incredible and, in general, the food is DELICIOUS. Great for dates... men love the all you can eat meat part, and side bar provides for a more balanced meal, if you need it :) Clarification on rating:  5 Stars for the food itself - amazing food. 3 Stars for the service - they don't come around as often as is desirable  with the all you can eat meats, and the main waiters aren't as attentive as they could be. Not terrible service, but just, not great.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-26", "type": "review"}
