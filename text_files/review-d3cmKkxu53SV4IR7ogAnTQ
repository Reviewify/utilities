The steak taco was ok. Meat was nicely marinated and the corn tortilla was fresh. The gourmet steak taco was also ok but I wouldn't get it again as the tiny amount of bacon didn't make it any better for me. Overall I found Rubio's overpriced and the portions too small. Normally 2 tacos would fill me up but I would need 3 or 4 here. The tacos are much better at El Indio and Don Carlos taco shop.", "business_id": "RkI4ePwxDqgtML9TTz45JQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-23", "type": "review"}
