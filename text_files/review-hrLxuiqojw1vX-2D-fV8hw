The cookies are pretty fresh and there's a good variety to choose from, allowing everyone to make their perfect ice cream sandwich.\n\nThe closest thing we have to this in the Bay Area is Pacific Cookie Company Factory in downtown Santa Cruz, and Mrs. Fields in the malls, but price-wise I don't think they compare. UCLA students have got it good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
