My eyes were as wide as dinner plates when I saw the price and then saw how big the cookies were and how much ice cream you get. This place is amazing. The cookies are pretty fresh and there's a good variety to choose from, allowing everyone to make their perfect ice cream sandwich. The closest thing we have to this in the Bay Area is Pacific Cookie Company Factory in downtown Santa Cruz, and Mrs. Fields in the malls, but price-wise I don't think they compare. UCLA students have got it good.", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-04", "type": "review"}
