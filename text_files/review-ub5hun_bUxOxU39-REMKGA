A coffee and pastry?  This is the spot to beat in Harvard Sq.  Convenient walking location (but forget about parking nearby), and slow (but worth the wait) takeout of veggie-filled sandwiches, amazing grilled cheese, fine soup/salad offerings, and coffee/pastries galore...  Great atmosphere indoors too, but tables are sparse, even with the hidden seating upstairs.  Most tables are monopolized by laptop toting students.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ"}
