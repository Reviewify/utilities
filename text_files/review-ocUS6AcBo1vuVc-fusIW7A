The massage was one of the best I've ever had and Michele really picked up on where I was sore.  I usually get 90-minute massages because I feel that I don't always get a lot out of a 60 minute massage, but I was completely relaxed by the time I left. Michele used a firm and vigorous approach to really get the most out of my hour. I will definitely be returning!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2wZK_ccm-mXR4X8T7oBxjQ"}
