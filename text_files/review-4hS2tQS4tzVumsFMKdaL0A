It's not street food - it's togo food and overpriced. There's nothing worse than a stingy bbq joint and that's one for ya. $2 for a 1/4 cup of slaw that didn't even touch the sides of the sides compartment in the box - FAIL. I knew it was a bad omen when all the people were skinny. Good bbq = fat people.  Going to try Good Food truck next time--although by the time I get around to trying it - I hope they figure out a way to keep the waffle cones from leaking out the bottom - both my coworkers spent the rest of the day looking like they wet themselves.", "business_id": "rFYqr2wSHR7lyKOB0z0LAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-23", "type": "review"}
