I went there all the time as an undergraduate.. not because it was cheap or easy to get to on a drunken night... but because it was delicious. Their food is never greasy. Instead of using queso dip on their nachos for example, they use fresh shredded white cheese of some kind. Personally, I like Cosmic better than Carrburritos. I think its more flavorful and more fresh tasting. I never feel gross after I eat there as I would leaving Chipotle or Qdoba, which makes me happy both at that moment and the next morning. My wallet is pretty happy too. The location is ideal for late night food, which makes them a popular choice come 2:00 AM, so beware. The line may get long and oftentimes stretches out of the small restaurant, but lets face it you are probably drunk and you don't care. Cosmic, you will always have a special place in my heart. On a side note, i would NOT reccomend the burritos and quesadillas you will find at various campus owned convenience stores (student stores, Tarheel cafe, etc.). They are often too dry or too soggy, and do not represent the deliciousness that is a fresh Cosmic Cantina burrito.", "business_id": "142ixzjxpVi7VxR27Dsm0Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-10", "type": "review"}
