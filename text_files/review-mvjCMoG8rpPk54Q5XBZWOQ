Tahitian? Fox sports bar? The grape, which in addition to being overpriced has very little actual food? \n\nCraving sushi, I checked this place out on an early Saturday evening (7ish). It was pitch black and fairly deserted, but they let me and my boyfriend in without even an odd look, even though I was wearing glorified pajamas (fresh from a meditation class) and he had cut-off jeans on. The sushi is good, but EXPENSIVE. The *red samurai* with spicy tuna and serrano pepper was the highlight of the meal - I would go back just for one of those. \n\nAlso, our server rocked. He made sure we got out of there in less than 45 minutes in time to see Batman, AND he brought us free shots.\n\n3 stars if you are already at Atlantic Station and need to eat something besides movie popcorn. And because we got free shots. Otherwise, it would be 2 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dchpdGlWTlC2w_zEOV0KYg"}
