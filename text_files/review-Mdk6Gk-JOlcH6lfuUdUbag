From my last review, CREAM has improved to almost a full 4 stars but still falls a bit short. The cookies were much much better. Fresh & warm. and my ice cream didn't melt into a bag of slush!! Two huge improvements from my last visit. So why not a 5? CREAM recently raised their prices from $1.50 to $2. The reason? Because the prices of gas have gone up and the suppliers needed to raise their prices to compensate. Their cookies are Otis Spunkmeyer and the ice cream we think is Double Rainbow. I'm still not impressed by the fact that quality can fluctuate so much between two visits and that it's also not site produced. However, $2 is still decent because no one else in the area offers anything like CREAM. - Jenn", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-10", "type": "review"}
