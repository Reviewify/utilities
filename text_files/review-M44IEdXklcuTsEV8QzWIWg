I'm no health nut or tree hugger or really anything special.  But I do believe that if you can raise livestock/crops without extra chemicals, that's probably the better way to do it.\n\nThat being said, I'll probably never eat here again.  The burger I got was quite small and very mediocre.  I was really excited for the sweet potato fries, but they totally let me down.  They were cold and undercooked, just not very good at all.\n\nI guess my favorite part was the sodas.  Both the cream soda and the black cherry soda were quite delicious and you don't often see them in fast food (quick service?) joints.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UopVUJ32ASCt-ek3guCmwQ"}
