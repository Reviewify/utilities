Lots of seating and power outlets. Free wifi with purchase [ limited to 2 hours I believe] - make sure you don't throw away your receipt because it is where the wifi code is. \n\n$3 credit card minimum - ordered a large coffee with an extra shot instead of a small coffee - ended up bouncing off walls till the afternoon.
