The overhead menu above the cash register says \"Mocchachino for $2.70\", so I order one. The woman behind the register rings it up, and charges me $3.41 for it. Not a big deal I thought, so I said to the woman \"the mocchachino sign is $2.70, how come the tax is so high?\" The woman says in an angry/annoyed tone \"We don't make mocchachinos, you have an ice frappe.\" I said \"I just ordered a mocchachino, and the guy said OK.\" And she repeated, louder and in an angrier tone: \"We DON'T make mocchachinos now. We only make it in the summertime. That's an ice frappe\" So I said \"Ooookay, I wish someone had told me that before I ordered it.\" So I gave her the change. She takes it, and, to further convey her annoyance, loudly throws each coin one-by-one into the cash register while glaring at me. Excuse me, I'm not exactly sure what I did wrong. One thing is for sure, she was extremely rude to me and I will never go back. And why would you post things on your overhead menu if you don't make them??! If she had apologized for the mistake, I wouldn't have had a problem. But she made it seem like it was my fault. BTW, their food isn't so clean either. The salad made my stomach hurt.", "business_id": "8MD8Pjr2w_sB6bBV8iw4qA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-04-17", "type": "review"}
