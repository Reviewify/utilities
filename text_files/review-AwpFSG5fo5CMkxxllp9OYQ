Well, ignorance has never stopped me before! I am rating this place 5 stars because: - I like the fluffy pink surfaces - I think it's cool to collect retro games/systems - They are trying to develop a gaming lounge (called \"Level Up\" - cute!) which I would most certainly frequent. I may not be a \"gamer\" but I do appreciate nerdy boozing opportunities So, a review from a video game voyeur - take it or leave it!", "business_id": "YVcJQvyb6KCRIWGTZt8wbA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-29", "type": "review"}
