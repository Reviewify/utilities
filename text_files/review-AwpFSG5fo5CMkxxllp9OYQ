Well, ignorance has never stopped me before! \n\nI am rating this place 5 stars because:\n- I like the fluffy pink surfaces\n- I think it's cool to collect retro games/systems\n- They are trying to develop a gaming lounge (called \"Level Up\" - cute!) which I would most certainly frequent. I may not be a \"gamer\" but I do appreciate nerdy boozing opportunities \n\nSo, a review from a video game voyeur - take it or leave it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVcJQvyb6KCRIWGTZt8wbA"}
