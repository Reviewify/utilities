They have the best burgers I have every had. They are a chain out of the Washington D.C. area. This is the first Five Guy's in the Pittsburgh area. It is right up the street from the O.  They offer burgers, hot dogs and fries. You can choose from either a hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger or a bacon cheeseburger in two sizes a \"little burger\" single patty burger or two patty burger. All toppings are free including: mayo, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A-1 Sauce, bar-b-q sauce and hot sauce.  I always get a bacon cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, green peppers and bar-b-q sauce! YUM  They also offer kosher style hot dogs, cheese or bacon dogs, bacon cheese dogs, veggie dogs and grilled cheese.  Fries are available in two styles, regular and cajun and are cooked in peanut oil.
