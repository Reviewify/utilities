So I was so excited to find out Seattle had a good selection of stores that do this, and so far Crossroads has come up at the top of my list.\n\nFirst off they are picky, really picky. My first time selling they didn't take ANY of my Seven for All Mankind jeans, also some of my surf brand tops (Roxy or Billabong). Which was a little disappointing since when you look through the racks you find pieces from Forever 21 or Target, like REALLY ugly pieces of clothing. It left me thinking \"you take that crap, and won't take my awesome Billabong clothes.\" The girl reviewing my clothes explained that a lot of my clothes were not \"in season,\" understandable I just came from Hawaii were every season is a warm one. She also said to save some pieces and sell them in the spring. Always check their yelp page and website for what season they are buying for.\n\nIt obviously pays to be picky, because I always find something when I visit. They have a good selection of jeans, coats, sweaters, and dresses. They also have a lot of designer items displayed which is really helpful. Some of the best pieces I've found were a BCBG blazer for $18, Steve Madden boots for $23, and a few Madewell tops for under $15. Prices are reasonable, but as a shopper always be aware of what you are buying, how much is the actual retail price is. If a Forever 21/Target/H&M shirt or top averages $17-$22, would you pay $11-15 for it used, knowing the quality of garment? I wouldn't it. And as always double check the quality of the piece, they are picky but somethings can be easily missed, tears, pit stains (seriously I saw a Top Shop top with MAJOR sweat stains, nasty). \n\nSpring is coming in a few months, I'm having my mom mail over some of my Spring/Summer stuff from back home, hopefully I'll get a good trade in!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lZWDJ6nNfDmkV2NVdNhJOQ"}
