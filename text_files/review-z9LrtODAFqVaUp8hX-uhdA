At first I was hesitant to have a student work on my hair, but there was an instructor checking in and I ended up really impressed with the trim.  They also included a quick head & shoulder massage and mini-facial which was awesome.  I would say that over all this was a fantastic deal, especially if you are low on funds and like Aveda.", "business_id": "5KcNXYojdWmoCTbTzO1fMg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-19", "type": "review"}
