The food was not spectacular. I ordered the shrimp sauteed in sambal sauce, which was pure sambal (Chinese chilies) mixed with 7 shrimp on top of a bed of white rice. My husband ordered a forgettable Mediterranean wrap. Credos for serving up authentic spicy food, but nay for the lack of originality when it comes to how they mixed the flavors. Also, the service was crappy. I guess what would I expect from a college bar. We ordered two beers and our meals. Twenty minutes later, the waiter asks us to remind him what we ordered. Then it took another 30 minutes for the drinks to come out because my husband's special beer glass was going through the wash. Sadly, when his beer arrived, the glass was hot, which made the beer strangely warm. Overall, what do you expect? The food was half off and watching the future powers of the world hang out with their professors was fun.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-06-25", "type": "review"}
