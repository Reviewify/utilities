The host greeted us with a grimace and looked us up and down before deciding to answer the phone and take a reservation before seating us. For the record, my friend and I were dressed casual chic, no mowhawks or whatever. So I don't know what was up with that.  Our waiter was knowledgeable but also no smile. His attitude was cold, curt. One of the female food runners, however, had a suitably warm and engaging manner which saved the night for me. At a place like this I find service to be an imperative part of the experience. If someone with a frown snaps a menu out of your hands or slops a dish on your table, its going to color what you think of the place, no matter how good the food is. Speaking of the food, I was not impressed. It felt a little less than adequate. The selection is limited and plain, not much adventure or creativity.  The wine list, however is really quite extensive for such a small place, so this may be a good place for those jonseing for such an experience.  To balance this review out, I liked the amount of time I was given to order and finish the meal. Nothing felt rushed (except for the surly manner of our waiter). Although if you were in a rush, this might not be a good place to go to.  I'd say, take a friend, order some appetizers at the bar and try 2 bottles of wine over the evening. Save your money for a sit-down meal somewhere else.", "business_id": "F6Qsav77WqGhstQ1E2xRGQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-01-18", "type": "review"}
