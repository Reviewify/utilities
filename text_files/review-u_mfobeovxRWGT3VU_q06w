A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I were up unusually early for both of us, so we just randomly decided to go the zoo. OMG, we had SOOO much fun, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to see the sea lions because their exhibit was closed. The poisonous frogs were the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life. Not having to pay for parking was a plus. That was one great memory I'm sure we'll both keep for ever.", "business_id": "rsEJu-ANPOBdSaR4ikLHgg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-17", "type": "review"}
