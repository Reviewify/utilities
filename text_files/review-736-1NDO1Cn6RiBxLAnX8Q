My husband and I rode our bikes over just as guava and cream cheese turnovers were coming out of the oven. We split one of those and a fresh blueberry scone for breakfast, and got a red velvet cupcake as a treat on the side. We also brought home some fresh bread. Everything was DELICIOUS and the family that was running the bakery is super friendly and welcoming. Also, I understand that the bakery was recently redone... it looks great in there!", "business_id": "Cd11AiNEeUSrxoiAZxw3bw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-21", "type": "review"}
