I stopped in today with my colleague Arthur O. for lunch. The most amazing thing about the Pho Bar is how good it looks. Aside from the fact that you order at the cash register and get food brought to your table, Pho Bar could be described as upscale and tony. We sat next to the fireplace, which was definitely roaring. I liked that we could see into the kitchen, which looked squeaky clean. The people who work at Pho Bar could easily be described as attractive and friendly. Our lunch was A-OK but seemed slightly expensive. The tastes were clean and varied. I ordered a special consisting of a small house pho and a half banh mi -- I got the barbecued pork sandwich and responded that I had no objections to the jalape\u00f1os that came in it. Our lunches came lightning fast and they were pretty good. I can't imagine that I won't be back. We must have been lucky because we were able to walk right up to the register when we arrived at 12:15. A half-hour later, there was a line out the door.", "business_id": "ZmYIPv4XQQ2bT4dgl6ezzA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-19", "type": "review"}
