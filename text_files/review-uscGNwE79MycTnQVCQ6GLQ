Todd only gets one because I haven't seen him in a year or two. Todd hooked up my septum and my candy ; ) a while back and he was so nice and down to earth that I came back and found Lysa for my nape. My friend and I got them done together and she was very accommodating and much fun ensued and she did a fantastic job, was very informative without being condescending, and told us fun penis piercing horror stories. Everybody who sees my nape is amazed at how well placed it is and can't believe how long it's been in with no signs of rejection. The place has become so much more organized and is big, and clean, and welcoming. Unlike any other piercing place in the East Bay.", "business_id": "LJVOIvGhqcnvzAp7GGcctQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-27", "type": "review"}
