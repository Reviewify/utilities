Being a student at USC, this is the perfect place for me to kick back with my friends, have wine and great food at great prices. Quality of food, service, ambience is superb. \n-Ambience is great\n-Fabulous wines\n-small plates so you can order a lot to try and share with your friends\nI had:\n-bacaro burger: good meat, I like it with the fried egg on top\n-pork belly skewers: unreal, but I love pork belly so its hard to go wrong for me. Some of the skewers were a little overcooked\n-beets\n-cauliflower: this was my FAVORITE! A must try! Their house sauce is to DIE for!! They bottle it up now and sell it there, Im going home with a ton of it!!\n- didn't try any deserts because we were so full, but the desert menu looked amazing as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8polKN4I6fJx1t8pPxogVw"}
