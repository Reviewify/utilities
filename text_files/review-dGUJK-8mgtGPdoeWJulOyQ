We decided on Mexican as the cuisine of choice and stumbled upon Distrito thanks to Yelp!  Spoiler: we loved it.\n\nSuch a cute concept with old-school movie style boards downstairs and a fun car that you can apparently dine in! We climbed up the stairs, past the collection of colorful masks, and sat near the swings which we decided were cute but probably not comfortable. \n\nOur waiter was professional and knowledgeable which is always a plus. \n\nWe ordered:\nGuac and Chips - yummy, not spicy but still good\nTostada - all the ingredients were fresh but something was missing...\nMushroom Flatbread - delicious\nCarne Asada Tacos - AMAZING and prob really bad for me but who cares.\nSpinach Enchilada - very good, tasted homemade - well whatever that means since i've never eaten authentic homemade mexican food :) \nSweet Plantains - when are plantains not delicious? didn't need the cheese on top but cheese never hurts!\nChurros - must get, comes with a caramel sauce and chocolate sauce\nCoffee - high quality\nMexican Coke (as in made w/sugar cane and served in a Coke bottle) - worth trying\n\nAll in all, a great experience. Food was brought out a few dishes at a time and though thats a good idea in theory, we found ourselves full quicker than we would have liked. I guess its true when they you should eat slower so you eat less....but what fun is that?!\n\nThank you Philly for another amazing dining experience. You never disappoint. XOXO. Forever yours, E", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g"}
