My husband and I ordered the tofu lettuce wraps (amongst other things).  When they were brought out, I verified w/the server that the mix was indeed tofu and not chicken (both were options on the menu), and he insisted that yes, it was tofu.  I filled a lettuce leaf and began eating and noticed how wilted and borderline-spoiled the rest of the lettuce was, so my husband asked for new lettuce.  After 2 or 3 bites I was really questioning this tofu/chicken issue.  We started dissecting a piece and yep, it was chicken.  When the server returned with the new lettuce, we pointed this out and he got really huffy about it and took the plate away.  He returned after quite awhile with the correct mix (it was visually obviously different) and apologized.  I explained I'm vegan and it was kind of a big deal that I just ate chicken, but it didn't seem to be too much of an issue for him, as when the check was provided there was absolutely no compensation for any of this.  I didn't want our guests' dinner experience to be spoiled as well, so we kept the drama low-key and didn't pursue the issue.  But for all this, Melange is off our list for good.  Watch out if you're a vegan/vegetarian at this place; they'll trick you into eating meat!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aPdz29vOWj4fBlLlCBM7UQ"}
