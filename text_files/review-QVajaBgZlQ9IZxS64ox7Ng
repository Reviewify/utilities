I searched on Happy Cow for anything in the nearby area where I could eat and nothing came up. I dropped by old stand by, Starbucks, and was pleasantly surprised to see a cupcake store next to Starbucks that featured a different vegan cupcake every day! So exciting. I went in for a cupcake and was equally excited to see a vegan wrap featured as well. I bought both the cupcake and wrap and was happy with both. The wrap didn't look good - but tasted great. I checked out their website later and was pleased to see they also had a vegan brunch option and some vegan cookies on the  menu. I wasn't in town long enough to go back. I tried adding Dozen to Happy Cow so other veggies could find them, but couldn't add them since they also serve roast beef. Oh well. If you're looking for a good cupcake and veggie wrap, I recommend Dozen.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WXXHPnQ5ADn3mSbFmASHug"}
