The shelves seemed a little bare for a Tuesday night. Where's the damn strawberry koolaid and jalepeno potato chips? I admit I'm not a Publix guy. I prefer Kroger because it is cheaper and I don't get so confused by their store brand products. I spent about five minutes trying to figure out which loaf of bread was regular wheat.
