These burgers have huge patties. The place is always crowded though. It isn't exactly comfortable, but for some reason the experience is very enjoyable. The unique decor, politically incorrect but oddly accurate menu, rushing waiters, smoky ceiling, and 50 customers all trying to talk over one another feels so Boston. If you are a tourist, even more reason to go.\n\nCheese fries are my favorite side, strawberry frappes are killer, and the Joe Biden is my usual burger. If you get that, you'll have an awesome lunch for about 15 bucks.\n\nYou need to be pretty hungry to finish your meal, but if you go when you are starving you may get frustrated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg"}
