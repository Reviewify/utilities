Last night, I was greatly in need of a delicious frozen treat, so I invited a friend over and we walked over to Full Tilt at about 8pm to get my fix. It's supposed to be open until 10pm, and the last time we were there, we were assured that Full Tilt would keep more consistent hours than did the Pretty Kitty. However, to our dismay, it was closed, and there was a sign on the door saying that they had closed early to catch some sort of show on the Ave. So, I was pretty disappointed. Granted, it was 50 degrees out and rainy, so it's not like it was prime ice cream weather, but... I mean... They're supposed to be open until 10!  :( On the other hand, the time before that when I was there, the guy was kind enough to give me two half-scoops--so that I could pay for a single scoop, but was spared from the difficult decision between Ube and Coconut.
