I can't picture having dinner there. It's a fun atmosphere and decor for tea or desserts, but a little insane for dinner. Tea was fabulous, wicked expensive, but great, and when I asked if there was milk in one ingredient because I was allergic, the chef made me an entire tea without a drop of milk- it was amazing service for them to go that far out of their way without taking on anything to the bill.", "business_id": "jI4yOYZ7nZt1Yv_9GolxYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-13", "type": "review"}
