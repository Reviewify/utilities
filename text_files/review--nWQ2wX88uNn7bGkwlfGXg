I had heard a lot of rave reviews about Pampas and having been to Espetus in San Mateo, I was salivating to try another Brazilian steak house. I knew this would come at a price, but I have to be honest this was a bit much for what we received. We started with the side bar and it was ok, there was nothing there that I wanted seconds of, nothing that really stood out. \nSame thing can be said of the meat. The turkey and bacon were dry, the rest of the meat on a stick was less than stellar. The grilled pineapple which I always look forward to for a palette cleanser was,well just limp and flavorless. Service was good, drinks were good, but overall just was not impressed. Espetus does it better, the interior is much nicer, and the side bar is overwhelming. I expected more from Pampas and was just disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ"}
