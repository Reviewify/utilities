They just pointed out the very obvious that's clearly written on the bag.  The one plus thing is their huge variety but since it's a huge corporate chain, you kind of expect that.  I've been there at least 4-5 times since I got my kitten and all the employees I've spoken to don't seem to have any idea how to take care of a kitten/cat.  I don't even think they own pets.  Everytime I come here, though, I end up buying something for my kitten and I'm trying not to spoil him but it's so hard when they have a huge variety of treats and toys.  \n\nI do love coming here to look at all of the little animals and watching the trainers work with the puppies on weekends.  They're so cute!  There are always several animals running around so you'll find something to play with.  They also a have a cat adoption service with adorable cats and kittens that change up every week or so.\n\nI miss the independently owned pet shops at home :(", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hr597HbGWAp9UbF2JyhOgQ"}
