He has to be the nicest man and so knowledgeable! He takes the time to hear your concerns and makes you feel that no problem is too big.  My daughter suffers from acne and when he was examing her he put her at ease with the knowledge that this can be cured.  Follow my instructions, and together we can get rid of this acne.  Very upbeat, loves his patients, and clearly loves what he is doing!", "business_id": "eGE5Am6pxkMTgJ7tL0qG-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-21", "type": "review"}
