Everything always does. You see, one day on her show she featured a little known cupcake bakery in Beverly Hills. It was known as Sprinkles. This caused thousands of zombie-like Oprah drones to make their way to the store and spread the word like a $5 hooker spreads the clap. Business boomed. Eventually they decided to bake their crack cakes in other cities and now we have this one in La Jolla. Imitators arose and while some crashed and burned, others are strong players of the game in their own right. All, though, owe their viable cupcake-only business to Sprinkles, and for that matter, to Oprah.\n\nStill the best Red Velvet cupcake by which all other cupcakes have been and will continue to be judged against.", "type": "review", "business_id": "roEQNfyPi3jRv3WFFr-f_g"}
