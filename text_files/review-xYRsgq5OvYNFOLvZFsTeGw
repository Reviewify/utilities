This is place is one of the exceptions. Had, Shrimp spice sauce with handmade black linguini - Really good! Cod fish with mash potatoes, - It was OK. Although they serve bread with a nice deep sauce, it comes cold so I ask them the heat the bread, and the waiter was really nice about it. Also ordered corn soup that we sent back cuz was so blend and they took it out of our bill. Waiter was nice and the staff very attentive.", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-07", "type": "review"}
