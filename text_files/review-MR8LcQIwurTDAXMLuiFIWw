The service was really fast and timely. My sushi came out no less than 5 minutes after I ordered it. The waiter was fine. I mean he wasn't amazing, but when I went the place was packed so I understand why he didn't give me too much attention. \n\nThe sushi itself was was good stuff but not amazing by any means. It just didn't have as much of a \"fresh\" taste to it as I would've liked.\n\nBy far the greatest strength of this place is the price. Very, and I mean very reasonable. The fancy rolls all averaged around 6 bucks and the basic stuff like California roll, spicy tuna roll and ect were all a measly 4 bucks.  Really, if the food wasn't so cheap I'd probably only give the place 3 stars. This is definitely one of those 'You get what you pay for' places.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg"}
