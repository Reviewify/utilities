Their food does.\n\nAnd their food is good. Very good actually and well priced. I went there a couple of times for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the value you get for what you pay. And it's also healthier than most places I've seen which is another great thing. Not a lot of guilt if you down those veggies.\n\nThe food comes out quickly and service is minimal but prompt. Just spot on if you ask me. The only downside to this place is that it's cash only (at least it was when I was there).", "type": "review", "business_id": "UZJ361wkdyZfxWax3oc3rg"}
