I complied, as I am wont to do do when someone says \"we can check out the hot chicks who work in the area while we eat\".\n\nUpon my arrival on the scene I spied a windblown placard on the street corner what pointed toward an entrance to the skinny little building. \"Free 1 Hour Parking\" it said (via writing, not actual speech-type language mind you.. this ain't Japanaroo).\n\nSo I aimed my autocarriage down 7th street and up into the innards of that wafter-thin castle. I especially delighted in the ticket-spewing, arm-raising entrance/exit robots and would (seriously, no joke) like to add one to my wish list for my own dream home.... you should see the plans for THAT sometime kiddies.... but on with this review.\n\nParking? Easy.\nRestaurant? Hard to miss.\nGetting there at 11:30am? Fairly brilliant. It packed in toward noon.\nMenu selection? Nice variety.\nPrices? Industry standarrrrd.\nService? Prompt.\nStaff? Friendly.\nQuestions? Answers.\n\nI (naturally) had the Bourbon Filet Steak Panini, which features (per their own description) Savory Tender Steak, Roasted Peppers, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, Baby Greens, Horseradish Aioli.\n\nI once knew a wench who had half-dollar aiolis and she liked to.... oh yeah... the review...\n\nThe sandwich was great, I enjoyed it. Now it DID have a small bit that was too rare, so I put that aside as a tribute to Ralph, god of uncooked meat.\n\nWere I to find myself again at Fresh To Order I'd probably go for the Asian Salad, it looked fantastic on that yard-long platter.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AWsOwlorVHRSpgPJy1I0eg"}
