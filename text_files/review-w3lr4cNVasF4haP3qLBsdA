I have thick, coarse hair that also gets extremely frizzy post-blow dry. It is almost on the verge of unmanageable if you do not layer and thin it out correctly. I came to hair.comb purely on the basis that it has an incredibly good rating, but then I realized that my hair is just different by the end of my haircut here.  I called in to make sure that they have stylists who know how to manage thick, frizzy Asian hair. A woman on the phone told me that they were all experienced in terms of dealing with Asian hair, so I believed her. But I digress. The product of my visit here was the complete opposite of what I had wanted. I came in with thinned, layered hair that simply needed a trim length-wise. I walked out with poorly layered hair that managed to turn into a bob (i.e a straight cut instead of a V-shape). This is honestly the worst case scenario that I imagined in my head and this is what I received. I hated it because it made my hair look even thicker than when I had just walked in. How does that even happen? I attentively watch hair stylists throughout the years handle my hair, and she cut it as if it were anybody else's hair, too. If you're going to cut it \"by the book,\" that doesn't work for a lot of women.  I had to go elsewhere in Bellevue to drop another $40 to get this haircut fixed. That's $80 total for a trim, including tip. So, if you have similar-sounding hair as me, I would not recommend this place at all. Go find some place else. If you have nice, fine, and manageable hair, this would probably be an okay place to go. The only reason I gave it 3-stars and not 2-stars is because the girl who serviced me was really pleasant.", "business_id": "pfHzrDXcG2fWix-ZhuWeVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-23", "type": "review"}
