I was impressed how lively the place was, more activity then what I would expect for a Tuesday night although that may have been influenced by the beginning of school. The food was excellent. My only complaint was with the waiter, up until it was time to pay he was very pleasant. He assumed that we would either pooling our money to pay the bill or that one person would be picking up the tab, we informed him that we would need separate tabs and his mood changed dramatically. Since our group was above the number in which the tip would be automatically added in had no risk in acting the way he did.", "business_id": "e9KXojla4OuVP7qcC5LNsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-12", "type": "review"}
