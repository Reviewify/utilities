Sure, you can call first, but if you're already out, you should probably go somewhere else.  Also, because the place is extremely crowded, it's also way too loud. The service was good - my water glass was never less than half empty, which is a huge plus for me.  The food was fine, but, honestly, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  The cornbread was a little dry and too chewy.  The pulled pork was delicious, but no better than pulled pork I've had elsewhere (I mean, come on - pulled pork, if properly prepared, is always delicious).  The ribs could have used a little more char.  The main reason I eat barbeque is the sauce, and I just didn't see anything special about it.  It was fine.  I like that they have a lot of combination plates, and it's nice that I was able to take home plenty of food for lunch the next day.  The prices are reasonable for what you get.  But, don't go there on a Saturday night unless you have nothing better to do than stand in a giant crowd of people and hope to one day get near enough the bar to order a drink.  Also, the parking lot is terrifying.", "business_id": "6Ld6AS4Qa_kVessELWw_tw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-20", "type": "review"}
