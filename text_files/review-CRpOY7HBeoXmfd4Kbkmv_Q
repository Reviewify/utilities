I still go once or twice a month. Their burgers are just a pile of greasy goodness! Try it with an egg and feta cheese.\nTheir fried vegs are to die for as well. Instead of ketchup, ask for cocktail sauce. They put a few drops of tabasco and you are good to go!\nEver since they were featured on the food network, they have lines going out the door, especially on the weekends. But the wait is definitely worth it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "THJN6kVcPUD2T04TrcmZng"}
