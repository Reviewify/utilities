Food is consistently good and affordable. \n\nAlways filled with local college kids but can't argue with the quality.\n\nIf you're planning on geting tempura I would recommend going with the bento box anyway.

Grab a couple of rolls and your set.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9VlV09HupfzZcRP3lTRi8Q"}
