Madam Mam's was one of the reasons I decided to come to UT. My sister introduced me to it when she was a student, and I was hooked. I even chose to live in Duren freshman year so I could get as close as possible to Madam Mam's. But over time I realized what I love is Thai food in general and not Madam Mam's specifically. My absolute BIGGEST complaints with MM: 1. What is up with those tables? Please stop seating me awkwardly close to strangers who will undoubtedly judge me for abbreviated my entire vocabulary as I tell my BFF all about my totes awesome weekend. BUY SOME TABLES THAT MOVE PLEASE!!!!! 2. The kind of awkward service/policies. It's definitely gotten better over the past 5 years that I've been here but they're very in and out about service. Regardless of those bad points, I have still probably eaten at MM over 100 times because it's good Thai food at a convenient location. My favorites: 1. Panang curry with chicken 2. Pad Thai (greasy, awesome) 3. Kao Soi - this is what I consider to be the most unique competitive advantage MM has. I refer to it affectionately as \"Big Bowl\" and it's super spicy, curry + egg noodles, and a whole lot more tasty. GET THIS THING. It's delicious and I haven't found it anywhere else and if you love thai food, you will love it. Especially on a cold Texas night. All of a sudden I feel like - Brutus: Caesar as Me:Madam Mam's because it was my favorite thing to eat besides taco bell for years. But it's still a campus favorite!", "business_id": "hTp23z3Q5PCvuGvKTIQtXw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-12", "type": "review"}
