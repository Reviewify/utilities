The first time was mediocre, the second time was awful. I did not finish my meal, despite being hungry.  The first time was \"whatever\" sushi - not much taste but tolerable. The second time was terrible sushi. Hard, chewy texture, not fresh spicy tuna roll. My friend ordered something else (duck?) which was also not fresh. We are not generally picky eaters or finnicky people. The service was also blah, we waited for a long time (there were 5 staffers and 4 people in the restaurant and nobody came up to us for quite some time). They offered to replace my sushi free of charge when we complained, which was nice, but by that point, I was so turned off that I said I would rather not eat anything than to order another item. Didn't try the desserts so cannot comment on that. But it's pretty hard to ruin a spicy tuna roll and Zen managed. The only thing semi-decent is the atmosphere, but you can't make up with atmosphere for mediocre food. Probably the reason why the place is always freakishly empty. Do not recommend.", "business_id": "cznOCtKLI3oai4u8pxKBvA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-25", "type": "review"}
