DRINK: Lavender Moon, gin (of which I was never a fan 'til then) & house-made lavender rose honey syrup. APPETIZERS: I tried half a dozen, but my stand out faves are Bacon, Egg & Cheese Toast (tiny, 2\" sunny side up eggs) & Sweet Garlic, Roasted Mushroom & Taleggio Toast (a mouthful of flavorful mushrooms is a happy one). DESSERT: Salted caramel & peppered chocolate tarts. Just the right amount of salty, sweet, chocolaty goodness.", "business_id": "oYN2AV5oYv93Z2NevvOKmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-28", "type": "review"}
