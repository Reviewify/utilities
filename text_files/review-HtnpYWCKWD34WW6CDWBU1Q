The wait staff was comprised of hipsters who seemed to have little or no interest in taking an order.  We ordered our tacos separately and then received them on one single tray and were tasked with parsing them out ourselves.  I'm fairly sure they do this to conceal the miserable portion sizes.\n\nThe food itself was no better.  While my carnitas tacos were decent, my date's fish tacos were an abomination.  Corn meal battered and fried they somehow arrived cold, leading us to believe they had been returned by another customer and then re-served. Unfortunately, the place is also overpriced, especially in light of its other flaws.  \n\nGo to Taco Bell; go to Blockheads; go to Chipotle; go to Qdoba.  Go anywehere.  Just don't go here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_5BoZ_C5zEl5M_MxT1W39w"}
