To be honest, I expected a lot better for what the owner raves about all the time, fresh ingredients, real meat, blah blah blah. When I got it, I didn't taste it any of those, cuz the gyo was just WAY TOO SALTY. I even had to buy a drink immediately after so I could actually eat it. I actually ended up throwing away 1/3 of it after I finished my drink, it was just too unbearable. His drinks were ridiculously pricy too, maybe that's his strategy of making a few extra dime. Definitely stick to the more well-known places around the area like sunrise deli or dyar if you want Mediterranean food", "business_id": "qgEx4cus-f9vgc5aBFJ8fQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-07-22", "type": "review"}
