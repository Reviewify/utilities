They came out and picked up my car, and delivered it back to me. The inside is absolutely sparking, even my dirty seats and my muddy carpets, and they were incredibly friendly and professional. I would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone and the prices are reasonable - I paid $90 for an interior detail, and they also washed it and took two nasty NYC Parking violation sticker remnants off my window. I'm hard to please, but I don't have anything but raves for these guys!", "type": "review", "business_id": "OVKLeWyxWXCG22k4v-H8Lg"}
