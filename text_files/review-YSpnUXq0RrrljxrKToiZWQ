Standing outside, late at night, with no real line, just a wall of people like a bar standing, waiting and watching as the different orders warm burn and heat on the grill. \n\nThis was the ending to many wonderful nights.\n\nSo many choices, that you never got bored.  I never asked what the different meats were or what the names meant, i didn't care. I just felt sorry for vegans.\nthis is what a hot dog place should be...\n\npart of the magic was watching the cook remember each order and the order each person arrived....\n\nNot that it matters but they sell cigarettes here, and never refused a book of matches.\n\nI am a lemon chicken kind of guy. You'll find yours.\n\nThis is serious hot dog place, no really I'm totally serious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qHmamQPCAKkia9X0uryA8g"}
