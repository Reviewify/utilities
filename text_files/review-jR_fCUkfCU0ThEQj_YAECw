The \"fashion\" here is nothing more than pre-package hipster-ness at a remarkably inflated cost.  I mean, the same shoes they sell for $2 in a bin on the sidewalk down the street (no, I'm serious) are $45 here.  $45!  These are no-name knock off sneakers that sometimes have the size stamped on the exterior of the shoe and here they sit.\n\nTheir sizes are enough to drive a person to an eating disorder as well.  I have no illusions about being a little guy but when I have to buy items in XL or XXL something's wrong.  \n\nAlso, it's owned by some cuckoo right-wing weirdo.  Does that make it truly ironic that they sell so much Obama swag?  \n\nAnyway, back to the bargain basement.  This is where you'll find items closer to what they should cost.  That transparant tee with the ironic saying on it that was $75 yesterday is $20 today and tomorrow may be $9.  Often they have 50% sales which makes things even more reasonable.  This is really the only way to shop Urban.\n\nDo yourself a favor, skip the rest of the store and head downstairs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "71bNDzSVHTY5LVO76nOyww"}
