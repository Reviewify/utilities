She definitely tried her best, and was friendly, but she was running around like a chicken without her head... and I was hungry and tired and cranky after driving back from NY last night. The boy and I stopped by here for some beer and bar food at around 9PM on Sunday night. They had a few tables filled, and we requested a table by the t.v. so that we can watch the Sox vs. Yanks game. Nice - no problem. My burger came out really good (cooked perfectly with melted cheese, bbq sauce, and bacon on a toasted bun), and the boy's blackened chicken came out looking pretty blackened. We both polished off our plates in no time. The beer was also pretty good - I took the server's suggestion for the Petit Mort Tripel, which tasted a bit like Chimay. My only complaint was that the first glass had a fly swimming around in it, and she had to get me a new one when we saw her again. She checked in on us pretty infrequently (she was pretty busy dealing with everything by herself), and I was just super tired and just wanted to go home, and we waited at least ten minutes for the check, when I finally just gave up and put money on the table and left. I hope it was enough ($40 for 2 sandwiches and 2 beers?), but I just could not stay for any longer.", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-07-28", "type": "review"}
