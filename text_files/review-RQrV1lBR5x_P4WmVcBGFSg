They had a few tables filled, and we requested a table by the t.v. so that we can watch the Sox vs. Yanks game. Nice - no problem. \n\nMy burger came out really good (cooked perfectly with melted cheese, bbq sauce, and bacon on a toasted bun), and the boy's blackened chicken came out looking pretty blackened. We both polished off our plates in no time.\n\nThe beer was also pretty good - I took the server's suggestion for the Petit Mort Tripel, which tasted a bit like Chimay. My only complaint was that the first glass had a fly swimming around in it, and she had to get me a new one when we saw her again.\n\nShe checked in on us pretty infrequently (she was pretty busy dealing with everything by herself), and I was just super tired and just wanted to go home, and we waited at least ten minutes for the check, when I finally just gave up and put money on the table and left. I hope it was enough ($40 for 2 sandwiches and 2 beers?), but I just could not stay for any longer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA"}
