The farmers market itself is beautiful--the pavilion is open and airy and looks out over the canal to Cass Park. Local musicians set up and serenade the patrons lounging on the dock and benches, eating their lunch and appreciating the warm Ithaca weather while it lasts. \n\nDefinitely grab something to eat before you peruse the stalls (the breakfast burritos are drool-worthy deliciousness!), then shop for your fruits, veggies, honey, maple syrup, wine, baked goods, flowers, meat, cheese, local crafts, plants, etc. Be sure to shop around before purchasing anything, unless you are partial to a particular stall--prices, though reasonable, do vary from seller to seller. And be prepared to get a slightly-dirty look if you show up without your own reusable grocery bag. \n\nThe Ithaca farmers market is a must-see for everyone who comes to town on the weekend. The beautiful, fresh food just tastes better here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "pzXYxXZP6Tx-fwQDY4TVuw"}
