Although the staff was very friendly, the cleaning was pretty terrible. The dental hygenist spent about 10 mintues telling me how important it is to floss and use mouthwash everyday, and then didn't even both giving me a full cleaning. He spent about 20 seconds removing plaque and about 30 seconds actually \"brushing\" my teeth. After, I was never offered mouthwash, nor did he floss my teeth. And to make it worse, he didn't use the water pick or suction tube at all. I have never walked out of the dentist office with such a terrible taste in my mouth. Not sure if this is how they operate with all of their patients or if it's because I was using a Livingsocial deal. Either way, I will not be returning to Dentex Dental!", "business_id": "rSHtNeAzQvQiV1aw4a_mJA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-05-08", "type": "review"}
