Their burgers and fries are great, especially the ABC burger (Avocado, Bacon, and Cheese). If you come during peak hours (lunch & dinner), there's gonna be a long line and its crowded. It's a big place, but tough to find seats even outside. I try to come off peak hours so I get my food faster. I also like the fact that there's TVs and a bar since I'm a big sports fan!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w"}
