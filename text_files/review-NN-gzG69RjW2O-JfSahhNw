Their dessert section is a bit lackluster, they have a softserve machine, select Hershey's ice cream flavors, stale cookies, and cut fruit. Everything served here is Chinese-American food, not authentic Chinese. The servers here are really nice.", "business_id": "MZJ9QAH-hgvtuL49a6D7bQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}
