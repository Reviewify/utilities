MmmmmGood! \n\nThe Bistek was bland, tough and chewy...Bleh!  Don't order! \n\nPortions are big and are great for sharing.  Order at the counter, grab a number and find a table.  They will bring the food to you.  The wait for the food is kind of long but totally worth it.  While u wait, sit back and enjoy the live music =) \n\nGot a great deal with Groupon.  Ceviche, Cochinita Pibil, Bistek, Guanabana and Jamaica...all for $17!! Score!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vC_6J_nGyf4J8xt-Vu6Shw"}
