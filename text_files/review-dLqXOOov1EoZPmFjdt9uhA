Must Order: Ceviche, Cochinita Pibil & Guanabana!!  MmmmmGood!  The Bistek was bland, tough and chewy...Bleh!  Don't order!  Portions are big and are great for sharing.  Order at the counter, grab a number and find a table.  They will bring the food to you.  The wait for the food is kind of long but totally worth it.  While u wait, sit back and enjoy the live music =)  Got a great deal with Groupon.  Ceviche, Cochinita Pibil, Bistek, Guanabana and Jamaica...all for $17!! Score!", "business_id": "vC_6J_nGyf4J8xt-Vu6Shw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-19", "type": "review"}
