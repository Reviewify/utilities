The portions are just enough. My panini was pretty good and I liked the dressing that came with my salad. I ate everything pretty quickly since it was decent sized. I tried my cousin's dish and she had salmon. I know she liked it, but I thought it was just dry. Going here to me seemed like a waste of $10 bucks. They did not have that many food options as I expected. After looking at the menu, I kind of wished I tried the Nordstrom Cafe in Valley Fair instead. Not really much to say about this! It is good for a snack, but I would rather go to Crepevine for lunch and pay $10 for larger portions and better food!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6hfzW9oYtVdFC7HCpY8Mag"}
