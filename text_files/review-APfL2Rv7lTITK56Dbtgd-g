Could be bc it was mass made for a party, or maybe the party host made poor food choices, but after looking forward to trying it I wasn't very impressed. They started with a chopped vegetable salad, my table was perplexed to say the least at what was presented. It's a creative salad I guess, more of a side dish if you ask me. No lettuce.. just chopped asparagus, cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, couple other veggies. One person at the table asked for more dressing, another asked for a completely different salad all together and still didn't like it. I thought it was ok, I was pretty hungry. Next came some kind of chicken with mashed potatoes. I thought it all tasted like butter so two bites in I stopped eating. They serve colored sugar crystals in a cute dish with the hot tea, I thought that was super cute. I would definitely try this place again, just not the same dishes.", "business_id": "-_FvwOM3_wku2zHiLjibgg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-08", "type": "review"}
