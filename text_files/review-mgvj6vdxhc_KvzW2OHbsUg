Our party of four arrived early, which was a good thing -- we were surprised when we stood up to leave that the place was packed to the gills with parties in waiting.  Tomodachi has a very ambitious and extensive menu, and to their credit, everything we tried was good!  We ordered their bulkogi, white tuna sashimi, salmon roll, beef teri, hamachi shioyaki, seared tuna, and ton katsu.  Yeah, a lotta food for a party of four. We were famished!! Dishes were on the pricey side. For example, I can usually get hamachi kama shioyaki in Sacramento for $6.50-8.50.  At Tomodachi's, it was a whopping $12.95.  Even allowing for the Westwood factor, it was still \"takai\". Tomodachi lost a star for unfriendly wait service that forgot the green tea we ordered, and another star for charging for second helpings of rice.  I mean, really.  We ordered over $100 for four people, and they charged us for a second bowl of rice?  Very unclassy. For the most part, there are slim pickings when it comes to real Asian food in the vicinity of the campus.  Tomodachi's stands out, and we'll probably put up with the marginal service and come back.", "business_id": "QiiuqzcD4HUqYpKhhGXU6Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-09-25", "type": "review"}
