If you don't know what type of chili you would like, they bring you out a sampler tray with their 4 authentic blends to pick between.  I like the Cincy the best, but the joy of the sampler is your can choose what you like.  \n\nThe portions at Hard Times are generous enough and the nachos are more than enough for a person.  Although they have other items on the menu, chili is what they do best. \n\n I found the musical selection during my last visit intriguing (as is any place that plays Cash, Usher, and the Cranberries in one sitting) Over all it is a good place to go if you are hungry and want some down home chili.  Apparently Thursday is half price margarita night too. Prices are decent and you definitely get full.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xNJsEyQLm-HkNtRkAc4-CA"}
