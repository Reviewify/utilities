Cut to years later, and I'd totally forgotten this place existed. So in the effort of finding something downtown PA that I'd not tried we gave it a shot. The hotel is quite nice and the walk upstairs into the well appointed dining room was a good first impression. However, the place was completely empty except for a table of four. Hmmm..not a good sign when you're in an area that has tons of retail activity. Given, they are off of the main Univ ave strip and they are in a hotel, but if the food is good, they will come right? Then menu had a lot of interesting items, so much so, that I decided on the Soleil Sampler. Lamp chop, petite filet mignon, seared ahi, and mini lobster pot pie. Now everything was cooked well, but the flavors just didn't do it for me. The meats were on the salty side (and I like my sodium) with the ahi being on the bland side. Lobster pot pie might have been the most flavorful of the bunch but also the smallest. I'd have to say I was disappointed since my expectations of the Mercury review.  The service was very nice and they treated us as though we were guests at the hotel. It's just too bad the cuisine seems to have gone down hill from what I remember reading. For the amount of money you'll end up paying, there are plenty of other place in the area where you'd have a much better meal.", "business_id": "5yC-Xx3Z1Z8jpMEolyCIeg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-03", "type": "review"}
