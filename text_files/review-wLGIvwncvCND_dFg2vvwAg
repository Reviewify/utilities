Coffee was good, but ordering/picking up is a bit confusing/unorganized like others have said. \n\nBut um yea... there's no wifi here - if you get lucky enough to get a signal from Harvard for their guest account you can get it, but otherwise there is nothing. Annoying when the only reason I came here was to work & drink a coffee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ"}
