After 10pm, a large two topping pizza is $10.  This allowed me to get a large smoked salmon pizza for $10.  While it might not sound like a great combination, this pizza was fantastic.  I expected skimpy or shredded salmon, but received fairly large pieces strewn across the pizza generously.  \n\nDrinks weren't expensive, and overall there was a good selection.  A $4.50 Lindeman's Framboise is about $1.50 cheaper than the equivalent size at the Blind Pig, if that gives you an idea of the pricing.  \n\nI can't wait to go again, fantastic pizza and reasonable drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ODURDhURWmZr6b--O4nt3w"}
