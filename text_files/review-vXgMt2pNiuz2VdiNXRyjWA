We waited more than an hour for a seat. During that hour we went and got two cupcakes from Kara's Cupcakes nearby. We ate them. Surprise! A $3 fee for that at the end of the meal per person per cupcake. What?! Seriously? We don't get a seat for an hour because... the place doesn't have enough *chairs* (not tables), and they charge us $3 to eat a cupcake per person when we also ordered alcohol, appetizers, and pizza? We spoke to the manager, and the manager was perfectly happy to take the fee in exchange for us never coming back.. Now THAT is service.", "business_id": "wBMzAzT3haIsaA0JoDr1-Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-08", "type": "review"}
