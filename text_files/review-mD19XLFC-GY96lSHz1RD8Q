Don't get me wrong - ice cream sandwiches for $1.50 (CASH ONLY)? Doesn't get any better, or any cheaper (if it does though please let me know). It's a simple concept and a great idea that a lot of people appreciate and enjoy. I think I'm docking a point off due to lack of consistency. It really depends on when you go. If it's crowded, be prepared to get cookies that are rushed out of the oven because they want to serve you as soon as possible (which is nice, but I wouldn't mind waiting if they wanted to cool them). My friend bought a cookie sandwich and it just looked like a mess of food after only two minutes. I just bought cookies, and they were all stuck together and the cookies were way too mushy in the middle. Major sadness. The second time I went however, it wasn't crowded at all, and the cookies were just chillin' on the side. I got a cookie sandwich and the cookies were still warm, but not gooey, so it didn't melt the ice cream and the contrast between the warm cookie and the cold ice cream was pretty satisfying. Turtle Cookie (caramel, chocolate, other stuff I can't remember but it's good) is my favorite, and i really like \"It's a Goody\" ice cream (caramel, chocolate, and other stuff I don't remember but it's good). I guess by this you can tell that I like caramel, chocolate, and other stuff I can't remember. I just wish there was more consistency with the sandwiches, which is why I prefer the other cookie sandwich places. Service: I love the people that work here. They are friendly and funny. Overall: It's good, and I am going to be there again whenever my sweet tooth permits me to.", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-25", "type": "review"}
