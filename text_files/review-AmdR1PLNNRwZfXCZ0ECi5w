Although I'm not Vegan, I am mostly a Pescaterian and enjoy eating healthy foods. The burgers here have a lot of flavor and big enough to split. My hubby and I ended up sharing a jalapenio burger with cheese. It was a bit too spicy for me and although the sauce was great, I'm not too big on beans which is why I couldn't give thier burgers a better review because the patties are made out of them.  We also tried thier coffee milkshake which was thick, rich and creamy. It had a good coffee flavor and was big enough to split. For me the place was just OK I guess. I wasn't blown away by the food but I might just try it again someday. But if you're somehow that does care for bean burger patties than you most likely will appreciate thier unique presentation and the mixing of flavors.", "business_id": "S4a-MaxMszQjSPSs1JSM2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-03", "type": "review"}
