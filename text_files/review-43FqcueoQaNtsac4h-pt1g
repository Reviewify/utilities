I thought the fixed price menu ($125 for three courses) was over priced for the amount of food we received. Other V-day menus were offering 4 or 5 courses for the same price.  The food was great though. I had the sirloin and my husband had the duck.  My duck terrine appetizer was okay, but his pork appetizer was awesome. We also really loved our desserts. The atmosphere was great. We had the uptown view, so if we go back, I would ask for a downtown/park view. The harpist makes the experience very nice. That's exactly what I would call a trip to Terrace in the Sky, an experience.", "business_id": "PUATlg41Z_bnmOPWcPBt-A", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-23", "type": "review"}
