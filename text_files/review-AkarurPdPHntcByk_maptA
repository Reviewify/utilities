It felt like the upstairs was more a family space, as I saw many children and teens eating nearby. The food was excellent, albeit pricey. The \"El Fuerte\" dessert (chocolate cake, flan, espresso ice cream, mouse, toasted walnuts) was arguably the best dessert I've ever had. The establishment itself leaves nothing to the imagination. From huge wicker booths to swinging chairs to walls of masks and an elite european-style bathroom setup, Distrito made the dining experience very fun and visually-engaging.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g"}
