This small yet welcoming little sushi restaurant was quite nice. The servers were all very friendly, quick, and knowledgeable with their menu items which was great. My friends and I ordered a bunch of stuff to share and everything was delicious, however I thought it could have been more flavorful compared to every sushi place I have visited in Seattle where I previously lived. I miss that amount of flavor in each bite and am still on a quest to find it. I did like this place and plan to return though! The ingredients were fresh, the pieces were prepared quite quickly, and they have a great amount of variety on their menu at decent prices. The music selection was a bit off for the atmosphere (it was some bangin' hard house) but for a tiny, quaint, little spot like this, we couldn't help but laugh at the awkward music selection. I did notice that they have a pretty rad happy hour that I'm excited to check out next time and suggest you do as well. From 2-6pm, M-F, they have some great drink and tempura fries specials. All of their dishes are decorated very nicely and I can't wait until I return on a nice day/evening so I can hopefully get a seat on their nice outside seating area. I love the look of this place! If you like a good roll, I would suggest trying out the Zoolander, Lion King, Cinderella, and Joshu-ya!", "business_id": "sxIPX4ZAipVl3ZCkkqXqZw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-03", "type": "review"}
