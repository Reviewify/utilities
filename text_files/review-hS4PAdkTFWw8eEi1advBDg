The sushi is wonderful-- fresh fish, perfectly seasoned rice, and creative combinations. My favorites include the crazy roll (shrimp tempura, spicy mayo, avocado, and cucumber), yummy roll (yam tempura, avocado, eel), winter roll (tuna, hamachi, and avocado wrapped with cucumber), and Boston Maki (classic salmon avocado). In addition to the standard list of maki, nigiri and sashimi, they recently added a whole page of \"special\" rolls that include maki wrapped with cucumber instead of rice and nori, oysters, and mango-lobster rolls. I haven't ordered cooked food beyond appetizers in a few years, so I can't vouch for the entrees, but the tempura, seaweed salad, house salad, and miso soup are all good. The only negative thing I have to say about Tokyo is that the service is usually terrible. My friend and I refuse to sit on the right side of the restaurant because the staff forgets about you. Tokyo is a terrific value, and is great for anytime of day-- I've even been known to go for \"sushi brunch\" on the weekends (they open at 11 am and have great lunch specials). Nothing cures a hangover like raw fish! Really, you should try it some time.", "business_id": "G7zdZt33PU_Gfmt3qHD88w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-13", "type": "review"}
