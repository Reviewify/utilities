As a busy college student, I don't have that kind of time. However, it isn't busy during non-peak hours, like after 3 or 4. Even though the sandwiches are good, I do prefer Mr. Pickles Sandwich Shop. For me, the battle of the San Francisco Sandwich goes to Mr. Pickles, and Ike's cannot compare. However, to satisfy a sandwich craving that's a lot better than Subway, Ike's is a great lunch spot. The people there are so nice, though, and I love the atmosphere! My 3. 5 stars get rounded to a 4!", "type": "review", "business_id": "GqFwgMpqggQgYTco0AbEAg"}
