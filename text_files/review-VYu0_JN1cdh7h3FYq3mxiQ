The food is always cooked perfectly and the staff is always very very friendly. We need more places like Hank's in PG County. We just don't get quality food and service in this area (The Man always has his foot on our neck!) and I value this place. I make it my business to patronize Hank's. It seems like more people are finding out about this place and that's good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cg86rnEnysZ2lBfE9RIdOA"}
