However, Shannon graciously took me about twenty minutes late. She really knows her stuff and is all about educating you on how to get clear skin. I have had bad acne for four years now, and for the first time in those four years, I feel hopeful that I can see some long-term improvement in my skin. The extractions were painful (of course) but I felt refreshed and clean afterward. The products she advocates and sells are excellent and reasonably priced; I highly recommend that you use them!", "business_id": "y25g0m3iGR1Zq_n3T8kpzw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-11", "type": "review"}
