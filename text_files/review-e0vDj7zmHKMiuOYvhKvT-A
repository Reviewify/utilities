However, Shannon graciously took me about twenty minutes late. \n\nShe really knows her stuff and is all about educating you on how to get clear skin. \n\nI have had bad acne for four years now, and for the first time in those four years, I feel hopeful that I can see some long-term improvement in my skin. \n\nThe extractions were painful (of course) but I felt refreshed and clean afterward. \n\nThe products she advocates and sells are excellent and reasonably priced; I highly recommend that you use them!", "type": "review", "business_id": "y25g0m3iGR1Zq_n3T8kpzw"}
