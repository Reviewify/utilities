The selection is great if you're willing to spend money and if not there's always the sale rack where I got a Cory Lynn Calter dress for $65. I have not experienced any problems with the sales girls there, for me they have always been very helpful and courteous. Also the accessories are reasonably priced and quite cute, I fell in love with a beautifully detailed cameo necklace and to this day regret not buying it.\n\nI have to edit my review because of the WONDERFUL service I got there today. I tried on a sale dress (which was final sale) and loved it so I had the girl put it at the register while I looked around. When I got home the zipper was broken I came back with it and asked though it was final sale if they could make an exception due to the circumstances. They did and they were incredibly sweet about and even apologized to me. In the end I ended up getting a different dress and a pair of earrings as a birthday gift. This place deserves six stars for the great people who work there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dt00zUldDzJplTEKRP50qw"}
