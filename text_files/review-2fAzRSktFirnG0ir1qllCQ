People complaining on here about the flavor profile need to learn how to order in a desi place when they are not in a desi neighborhood.  If you like spicy, ask for spicy!  The chicken korma and beef curry we had was powerful and good -- my wife usually doesn't order korma because it falls short of what she makes at home and we were both happy.  Garlic naan was fresh and tasty and the chai came in a pot instead of just a cup -- spot on.  The mango lassi was good -- not too sour and not too sweet -- it balanced the spiciness of our dishes well.  Great service.  I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because my wife is Bangladeshi and I reserve a 5 star rating for home cooked desi food!  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ee7h-Pp4jhAEQVK7ay2AtQ"}
