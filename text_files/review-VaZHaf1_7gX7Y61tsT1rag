You also get the stainless milkshake container and a long spoon so you can have the leftovers that didn't fit into your cup!  While you can get freshly made milkshakes or malts in any of the ice cream flavors they have, there aren't that many options.  Since they're a \"dairy store\" I'd love to see more flavors and ice cream items available, with more syrups, sodas, sauces, etc.  I'd also like a smaller size option.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JT-A1F67iKRf5ifGL8ry6A"}
