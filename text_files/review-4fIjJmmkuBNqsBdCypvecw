Impact has done great, creative things with La Val's Subterranean, the \"theater\" space below the pizza joint.\nI saw Ching Chong Chinaman and had a great time. There are some obstruction issues, but overall, the works they mount there are great.\nI love how one can bring in food from La Val's and munch during the show.\nI love theater that is accessible (I don't mean ADA accessible--I do not think this theater which is down a set of scary stairs is--but appealing to more than just the blue hairs who can afford theater). The artistic director and managing director are totally sweet, approachable people (though I have never worked with the AD, so I do not know know what she is like during tech week :-)). It has a really friendly community theater vibe to it.\nGood times, for sure.\nI lucked out with free street parking less than a block away, but there is a UCB lot nearby that is open to the public after work hours.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DxyqiEQF_AP_YsuBWcFnjQ"}
