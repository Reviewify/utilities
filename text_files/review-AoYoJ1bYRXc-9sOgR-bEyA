As she described their menu, which is comprised of hot sandwiches and crepes that you can buy on the street in France, my mouth was watering. We were very pleased with the cafe. First we were treated to one of the most delicious cups of coffee that I've had in a long time. For our main courses, my boyfriend and I shared one crepe with crispy bacon in a fondue of leeks, creme fraiche, and swiss cheese, and one with brie, turkey, honey and crushed walnuts. While I preferred with one with the fondue of leeks, both were wonderful. I also loved the atmosphere. We felt totally comfortable lingering at the window seats over long cups of coffee while enjoying the magazine selection (they have French magazines!), and enjoying people watching along South Street. The owner/chef was friendly and attentive. Overall, a great experience!", "business_id": "2Q5gjf_K68145UdUyKGAaw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-08", "type": "review"}
