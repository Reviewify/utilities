It's one of those places where it could be 2pm on a beautiful, sunny afternoon and there will inevitably be someone passed out on the bar, someone else doing coke in the bathroom and some depressing-ass drinking song like Piano Man playing on the jukebox. It harbors the type of misfits that give dive bars their true character, including the bartenders, who look like they've been partying for about thirty years straight. Ironically, Night Cafe hosts one of the best trivia nights in the city on Sundays. All of my nerd friends religiously attend, and we're talking serious nerds, like people who have been on Jeopardy before. The competition is fierce.  Night Cafe, I give you five stars just for hosting such a contradictory mix of freak shows within your own walls.", "business_id": "Og7V1RKK0juV0QLuJyYcjw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-01-24", "type": "review"}
