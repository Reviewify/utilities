Settled in the outdoor shopping center at Standford Mall, this elegant cafe is a convenient and enjoyable delight. Entertainment is provided by live piano and singing (courtesy of the servers). The Salmon and Pork have always been rather delectable. Their eclairs are a must try, but be sure to share! Talk about monster sized deserts!", "business_id": "olrFYjKobULoH4-ZucnpTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-02-04", "type": "review"}
