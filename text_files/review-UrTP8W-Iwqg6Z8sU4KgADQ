I ordered a small chicken platter with collard greens and yams for $8.  It was heavy and smelled oh-so-tasty, but waited to eat it until I got home.\n\nThe chicken had great flavor (chipotle, lots of pepper) but it was tough.  The collard greens were SUPER bitter (yes I know they're supposed to be bitter, but these seemed out of control).  The yams were kind of dried out.\n\nAll in all, I've had better \"soul food\", and I think I would have preferred Hemo's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FV130V7ArLHiNRtkCPbEMw"}
