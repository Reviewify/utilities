Happily, most places in town have the appropriate thickness and steam it for the appropriate amount of time.\n\nThe abomination that was my burrito was wrapped in thick, dry naste. The chicken ranchero had the flavor and consistency of wet cardboard. The rice was overcooked. Is it possible to water down guacamole without making the texture watery? Y pico de gallo es \"tomato.\" Los gringos no compreden. Extra charge for guac. Extra charge for sour cream. $0.50 for refills of fountain drinks.\n\nA friend wanted chili verde, pero no tenemos mucho! - he would have taken a little of this, a little of that. But they talked him into the \"spicy\" Chicken Colorado. Very not hot - but had at least a little more flavor than mine.\n\nQuesadillas are made lazy style - simply fold the two opposing ends, so nothing is closed. Sort of grill for a minute.\n\nThe staff seemed bored and disinterested. And my tummy was not loving me later.\n\nWaste of time. Never again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pp7GzAZtreah8vqJOLbqWg"}
