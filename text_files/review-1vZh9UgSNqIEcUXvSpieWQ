I should have taken that fact more seriously. The food is not bad per se. We got the ginger chicken udon--the udon itself was very tasty but the flavor of the overall dish was one-dimensional. And by one dimensional, I mean salty. I had the beef chili ramen and although the menu described the steak as being sliced, it came out more like chunks-- like the sort you see in fajitas. The ramen broth could have been tasty if only it wasn't one dimensionally sweet. But it is what it is. Prices are a bit higher than expected given that it's a chain.\nThe place itself is spacious. There are benched as well as window seating. I also think their big wooden (bamboo?) spoons were the best ramen spoons I've come across. My only real gripe is the waiter warning us after we ordered that, because the food is made fresh per our order, dishes might not come at the same time. (True to her words, my friend finished eating before my ramen came out.) I just find it silly and disingenuous when people use the made to order/freshness excuse as the reason for the wait--- how come I'm never told this at a Chinese or Vietnamese restaurant? Perhaps their white clientele believe this bull because they probably don't know how to cook, but as someone who basically grew up in a kitchen, flash-frying or stirfrying should not take longer than ten minutes. But it is what it is.\nI'd only go again if I was feeling nostalgic for their bamboo ramen spoons. Also, big plus to the hairy waiter dude in shorts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hKQsbxqTWumRK8OPk3uoEQ"}
