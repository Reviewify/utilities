(true to her words, my friend finished eating before my ramen came out.) i just find it silly and disingenuous when people use the made to order/freshness excuse as the reason for the wait--- how come i'm never told this at a chinese or vietnamese restaurant? perhaps their white clientele believe this bull because they probably don't know how to cook, but as someone who basically grew up in a kitchen, flash-frying or stirfrying should not take longer than ten minutes. but it is what it is. i'd only go again if i was feeling nostalgic for their bamboo ramen spoons. also, big plus to the hairy waiter dude in shorts.", "business_id": "hKQsbxqTWumRK8OPk3uoEQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-10-25", "type": "review"}
