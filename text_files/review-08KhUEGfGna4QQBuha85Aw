(ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them. reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is). sunday brunch is also tasty, although perhaps not exceptional. again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review. additionally, they have a happy hour on thursdays with $2 martinis (unfortunately, they're about as good as you can expect for $2). don't fail to check out their weekly $5 lunch specials, though. those are fantastic. can you tell i have a soft spot for papa george?
