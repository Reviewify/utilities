This is Papa George's--We ain't no chain!\" the owner said when I asked for a small menu substitution. I feel if your'e going for teh Greek/Diner combo, you can't go wrong with the \"American\" Gyros, French fries, and if you have room later--baklava sundaes! (ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them. Reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is). Sunday brunch is also tasty, although perhaps not exceptional. Again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review. Additionally, they have a happy hour on Thursdays with $2 martinis (unfortunately, they're about as good as you can expect for $2). Don't fail to check out their weekly $5 lunch specials, though. THOSE are fantastic. Can you tell I have a soft spot for Papa George?
