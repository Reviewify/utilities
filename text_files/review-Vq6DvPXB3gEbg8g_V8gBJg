While the locals know about it, you'd never find this place by driving and looking for signs This is a neighborhood Benihanas with more reasonable prices and food equal or better than Benihana. There is a teppan grill type of restaurant where some 8 to 10 people sit around a grill while the cook prepares the food in front of your eyes and for your amusement. The Halibut was good as was the rib steak and the special fried rice was also tasty. I recommend that this kind of restaurant have some sort of \"sampler platter\" for those who have never been to this type of place before. If it's your birthday, they have a cute little routine they go through which we saw several times while enjoying our dinner.", "business_id": "XRMlDR9xjIHE6RVzP3HctQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-11", "type": "review"}
