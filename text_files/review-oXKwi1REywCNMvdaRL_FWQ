When you order, you order each part separately: the pizza, then the wings, then knots or fries, and finally the soda. When my order came with COLD pizza, and no knots I called to inform them, and they said it was either wings, garlic knots OR fries; which btw makes no sense because if you order the pizza, soda, the garilc knots or fries you aren't getting a deal! (you actually pay more than the coupon takes off!) I went to explain how the screens were split up so it was impossible not to order wings, and he said I was wrong. Will never order from here since they were dishonest and rude.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8uz_6_ogNrpb_MxQnhjZGQ"}
