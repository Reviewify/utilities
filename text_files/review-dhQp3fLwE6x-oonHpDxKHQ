I am super surprised that the Gallery at the Network has not been reviewed.  This art gallery has been around for ten years and the art work selected for sale is as varied as anyone's tastes might be and at prices affordable for ANYONE!\n\nWe walked in and were immediately greeted by the salesperson who was so knowledgeable, I doubt that there was any information about any of the artists that slipped her mind.\n\nShe easily transitioned from one artist's pieces to anothers and gave background information, medium details and desireability for collectors.\n\nWe received reception informational cards, brochures launching upcoming events and helpful hints on the local artsy places to visit.\n\nWe even bought a ceramic Julie Dunn trivet as a memento of our trip.  You owe it to yourself to check this place out.  It's as fun and whimsy as it is affordable for anyone's artistic collective needs or desires.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0SepGsxqlMqBeVALZ6INyg"}
