I had to get up and stand in the middle of the restaurant to make my decision. My chicken sandwich was fine, but not especially memorable.  The dude got the signature burger, with the jalapenos mixed in with the meat - the bite I tried was okay but nothing to write home about.  I did like the potatoes served on the side.  I could probably have used some more of those potatoes, to soak up all the vodka sodas and various shots I proceeded to drink. The space is cool, but super crowded.  By the time our large group of friends arrived, there was absolutely no way were were going to be able to congregate around the table, and we had to move to the bar area.  No big deal - it was a Saturday night after all - but the place does get pretty packed.  The clientele was an interesting mix of students and young professionals.  Much to my amusement, one member of a tableful of college girls decided to send the dude a drink, mere moments after the waitress had chided us for \"canoodling\", then proceeded to go out of her way to ignore him, middle school style, for the remainder of the evening.  It was strange and hilarious.  And our waitress was otherwise very accomodating, especially when we had to chase her down to be sure she was bringing us Patron and not Cuervo.", "business_id": "7MN8kNyuKDZtoSoVdZDCpg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-12", "type": "review"}
