You don't have any friends?\" Sigh. So we had no friends, but a fulfilling dinner. I had the pesto pasta, which was fresh and well prepared but also very basic. The lentil soup that came was a treat, as well as the baklava after. For a vegetarian, though, this was one of only a couple of regular dinner options. To really experience Continental you have to be a carnivore. My dinner partner's meatball dish basically arrived with an angelic choir. So I'd give them 3 stars for vegetarians, 5 stars for carnivores, make that an even 4 and this review's a wrap (or gyro or whatever)!", "business_id": "798-eBr6EdOJktDT74fj2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-27", "type": "review"}
