We ordered the California Bibimbap's with chicken and another with beef kalbi (korean short ribs). Both plates were $10 a piece with VERY little protein( 4 midget ribs). Also had a Izzy drink $2.50. Bibimbap's included carrots, red cabbage, jicama, cucumber, lettuce and your choice of white/brown rice or noodles. Staff was friendly and the interior was nice. Food was \"A-OK\" but a little overpriced for what you get. Still hungry, FAIL.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v2oxMmRA3SEr9l4aQvmEMw"}
