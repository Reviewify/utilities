Cheap, and lots of food. So... so... delicious.\n\nIt's too bad it isn't open that late, and sometimes, it's so damn busy in there, it's impossible to get a table, but I've always been able to get one by the time I get my food. I think their service is pretty fast, actually, not sure what other people are talking about... and I avoid going on Sunday mornings because I know it's brunch time, and I don't bump into too many moronic hungover fools. =] If they were present, I was not made aware, so it couldn't have been that bad.\n\nIf you love breakfast food around the clock... this is it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WGSy8QlY1vn5lpCNJTOLxA"}
