I haven't been there in a year, saw them just buy the tobacco shop next door and were just starting the remodeling. I've eaten at the old location for years, got off the freeway after 5'oclock heading to Everett (you KNOW how bad traffic is at that time!), on the way to work and being late for stopping there, drove from DT or Northgate just for lunch, caught the bus from 45th and Stone just to go there on a Saturday afternoon, these guys are worth it every time. Hmm,,I think I'm gonna go by there tonight! The food it always fresh, always hot, always good. I admit that I have not been as adventurous as I should be, but I know they always give me the \"nod\" hello, never mind waiting, they are all good guys that they've got working there. They are open till 3:00am, gawd I have NO IDEA why I haven't been by there after getting off work at the bar!?! There is never any bullshitting around here. I've been there all hours, seen all kinds of crowds there. You place your order, and unless there are 20 people ahead of you, your pita bread gets slapped on the grill in the next 15-30 seconds. You can see what's cooking, shout at him, \"no onions, extra onions\", he'll look back, \"this one here?\" give you a nod and go back at it. Always nice guys, you feel appreciated as a customer, the owner has never known my name, but I feel like I've known him for years.", "business_id": "n3KaV4ojMr34zdnJBTvRAw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-13", "type": "review"}
