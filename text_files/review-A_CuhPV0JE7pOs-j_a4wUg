I've been here a bunch of times and have not been disappointed yet.  The meal portions are fair/large, so you get your money's worth plus a little left over for lunch the next day. My favorites are the chicken kadai, biryani, and the skewers.  The kadai (kind of like a wok) is made fresh (takes 20 - 25 mins) and dropped off at your table.  The biryani is great but call ahead to make sure its being served (just on Friday's!).  That may be my only issue with this place, certain days have certain meals ... so just check ahead. If you are looking for a classy establishment, skip this place.  If you're out looking for some great reasonably priced food, you can't miss this.  If you're a veggie, you might wanna check out the place next door for more options.", "business_id": "9OhPfV0C3Q49l5tSre2MuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-25", "type": "review"}
