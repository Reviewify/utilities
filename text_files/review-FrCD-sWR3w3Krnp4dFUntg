It made me wish I had bought here, and I will definitely go there for the mountain bike I've been thinking about.  The staff was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Unlike a lot of other Austin bike shops I've been to, I never once felt an air of  pretentiousness.  \"The only bad question is the one you don't ask,\" said the sales guy to us.  When my fiance had his bike picked out, they aired up the tires, shortened the handlebars, and attached the lock he wanted.  On our way out, he couldn't figure out how to take his lock off it's hook, so we had to go back in and ask.  But again, they were super helpful and didn't make us feel like idiots.  The prices were low, the selection was wide, and the people were great. Highly recommended!", "business_id": "QokmCWjgYqiRi5YMMr_7Ww", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-03", "type": "review"}
