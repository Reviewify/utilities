They were good! nothing really stellar that i'd feel the need to stalk them for, but if theyre in the area they're worth a try. I tried the steak taco and the spicy pork taco. The steak taco was good- a bit sweet but i like that and the steak was well cooked. The spicy pork taco- not that spicy but it was decent. I liked the steak better I found myself wishing they had a bigger menu - something small to nibble on. but the only side they have is kimchi and i am so not a fan.", "business_id": "lIPv3-ocdPvkiiE6JaQi9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-22", "type": "review"}
