The nutella was very balanced with the crepe mix...none of them overpowered each other. If you've had nutella crepes before you know how bad it can be! This was not overly sweet and was not oily or anything!!\nNice place for snack or lunch or breakfast  if you cannot wait at Louie's :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "fdBaf_H31MY4nA4Yuw6MfQ"}
