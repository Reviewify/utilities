Above Pamela's restaurant, half shop (selling Peruvian handmade goods)- half restaurant (with Peruvian food). They offer three to four choices each day, meat eaters and vegetarian peruvian dishes, similar to curries. About $10 a plate. Fresh ingredients, friendly waitstaff, clean and comfy environment. They also have fresh squeezed limeade. Highly recommended but not your typical restaurant experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw"}
