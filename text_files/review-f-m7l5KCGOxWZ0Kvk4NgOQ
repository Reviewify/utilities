Now I'm going to direct all my friends to this joint!  I seriously think they should advertise more or something because whenever I walked by this place, nobody was inside. So anyways, I only found out about South Street when a friend came to visit me and had the sandwich with them.  I guess they didn't have time to eat before visiting me or something.  While my pal wasn't looking, I stole a couple of bites of their huge cheese steak sandwich.  I wanted to eat the entire thing myself, but it would look too suspicious if the entire sandwich disappeared. Everything tasted sooo good.  The cheese was nice and melted, the meat was flavorful, the bread was warm.  I can't believe I never stopped by South Street when I went to college in the area.  I totally missed out!!!   For a 9 inch sandwich, you can expect to pay around $6-7.  That's not cheap, but it also doesn't cost you an arm and a leg.  However, if you keep on eating cheese steak sandwiches, you can expect to gain a ton of weight...equivalent to an extra arm or a leg maybe?", "business_id": "mCOvYk2ujwvpqDdRKXADjQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-18", "type": "review"}
