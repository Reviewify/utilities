It feels like a place where you can hang out, by yourself, working on a project or reading or just eating their delicious tomato soup. Or macaroni and cheese. Or any of a number of tasty pastries. The coffee is good, it's generally always populated with students who are trying somewhat unsuccessfully to concentrate on some homework assignment or another, and they have outdoor seating!\nI like that they serve beer! And they have bands play there in the evening!\nMy only problem is, I can't study here because I am too busy watching people, listening to the music that is playing (too loudly for me to concentrate), or running into a friend.\nI love procrastinating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AXQhTGR3PLFk1TW72CbqvA"}
