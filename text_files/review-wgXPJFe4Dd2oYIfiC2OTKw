It being a larger vehicle, this amounted to $168. I was first surprised how much haggling goes on with the higher packages. Don't just take their first offer! Overall, my car came out pretty good. There were several tough looking stains in the upholstery that they removed well, but there were also several items that they missed that were rather obvious and I would have expected to get done for $160. On the plus side, as soon as I mentioned them, they went to work making sure it got taken care of.  The outside of the car still had several medium sized areas where the wax had not been rubbed off properly, and the top of the car was covered in wax powder. You could tell they skimped on there hoping I wouldn't notice. Unfortunately for them, I'm rather tall, and it was easy to see. There were also several of those little yellow (pollen?) spots that were left all over the car which were easily removed with a little bit of rubbing. I didn't bother making them get all of those since I just wanted to get home and I was pretty happy with the interior, which was my main concern.", "business_id": "1AuS2TA0gBLYiMh7s1rwfQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-05", "type": "review"}
