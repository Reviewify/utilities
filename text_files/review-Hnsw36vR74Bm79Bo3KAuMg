So I will judge it on its own. This establishment is going in the \"fusion\" or new style sushi, certainly not the traditional type. You can get pieces of sashimi or sushi but the quality of fish is average and I am sure there are specific places in LA for traditional sushi eating (sit at bar have beer with the chef and order o-makase).  That said, the the many varieties of fusion rolls are generously sized, tastes unique (if you scrape of most of the sauce, since it is same few sauces going onto every roll), and tend to have healthy cuts of fish in them (not butt ends or scrapings of fish). The lobster roll stood out the most to me. I think I liked the baked rolls here the best. They have mastered that, just the right amount of warmth and having the ingredients slightly melt together, it certainly does not come out like a baked potato.  Drink: Usual fare, nothing interesting. Service: Since I grew up here, the bowing and thanking for no good reason seems a bit too forced and uncomfortable for me. I prefer natural, friendly service with a smile. But, it's better than shitty service. Crowd/Ambiance: Locals from UCLA by the looks. Seating is OK, but the table height and size is uncomfortable for taller people. I had to slouch hard.", "business_id": "QiiuqzcD4HUqYpKhhGXU6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-26", "type": "review"}
