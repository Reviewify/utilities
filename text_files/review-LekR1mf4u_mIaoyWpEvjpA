It seems pretty easy to overlook when you are driving or even walking by.\n\nI had come in for lunch after it being recommended to me by a friend. He had warned me that it was not the best Chinese food (boy was he right!), but it hits the spot and at a good price.\n\nHe was very correct about the price: I think it was $6 for all-you-can-eat style buffet. The place had a very nice selection of Chinese and American dishes. They had a lot of the Chinese-American dishes like Orange Chicken, Kung-Pao Beef, Fried Rice, Chow/Lo Mein, etc., and they even had some Dim Sum, including Siu Mai, and Bao Tzu. They had a small selection of seafood, but it did not look palatable, so I tended to stay away from that.\n\nThe place seemed like a good place to come in with a group, and kinda sad place to come in by yourself. I saw one man near the corner of the booths who looked ready to just about kill himself.\n\nThe waiters/waitresses are very attentive and my water glass was never more than 1/2 empty. They were very courteous and I appreciated that.\n\nThe cleanliness at the tables were great, but at the actual buffet--not so much. It's most likely due to very disrespectful patrons who don't clean up after themselves (in fact, I KNOW it's because of this) and leave the buffets dirty, but I don't think they were ever wiped down in the 45 minutes I was there. I'm not a clean freak, by any means whatsoever, but I appreciate the facade of cleanliness at least.\n\nAnyway, I would rate the overall quality of the restaurant around 2.5. The food was alright, and I'm sure it would taste amazing intoxicated. Too bad I was sober and went in at noon when I could appreciate the greasiness. I might come here on my next visit to Chapel Hill this weekend! If I do, I'll be sure to update on my impressions of this restaurant.\n\nPS. Crap, this wasn't short at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6CruOxyuBRnJJx3wRu_oMA"}
