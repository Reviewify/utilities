This lunch of ebi (fried shrimp) ramen, pork tonkatsu and avocado boba drink was absolutely unfit for human consumption. I just threw it all into a garbage can. Never mind killing a homeless person with this trash food. The smell of rancid oil is profuse in this so called bistro and the MD Health Dept. should cite this place. Or the University should flag this place as unhealthy for patrons. Why did my lunch cost $50 ? I had to go elsewhere for a real lunch. How this place ever rated fours and fives is beyond my basic human instincts.", "business_id": "8Doa_RDbhmK9a1xFnputwQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-26", "type": "review"}
