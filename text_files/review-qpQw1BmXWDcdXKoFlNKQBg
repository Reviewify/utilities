Ummmmmmm, not so much. I decided to take a group of friends/family there on Friday night, as we had a guest in town who loves Asian fusion food. \n\nEchoing the sentiments of Sherry C's review, Unicorn was good, but just lacked that special sum'in sum'in. While the ambiance was cool, and the fruit sorbet champagne shot/ mango champizzle cocktail were tasty treats, the food was pretty.........eh (thumb/pinky alternating left and right). Our waitress was quite helpful (cutie pie w/ funky glasses and dark hair), but net-net, my quest for an E. Bay Asian fusion spot continues..", "type": "review", "business_id": "VezCWH_yg7eHU3eOy9K98Q"}
