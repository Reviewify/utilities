I've been here before and had bad experiences, but today there were *helpful* people in every department, the manager personally made sure I was getting the best deal on the chair I was buying (by honoring an expired sale price) and the guy who helped me check out (his name was Sol) was super-helpful and carried the whole thing out to my car.
