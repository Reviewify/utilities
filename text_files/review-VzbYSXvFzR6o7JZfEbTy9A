At first, I only got bites and didn't get one of my own, but YUM!  I tried the double chocolate cookie with mint ice cream... the cookies were STILL WARM!!!!!  \nWent back later because I HAD to try it myself.  I got 2 warm, white chocolate macadamia nut cookies (you can mix & match, but I am a purist :) with vanilla cinnamon ice cream in the middle.  \nHEAVEN!\n2 cookies of your choice (same or different) with ice cream of your choice in the center for just TWO BUCKS?!?  ($2)\nWhat???\nI hope our son picks Cal just so when we come visit we can eat Cream :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
