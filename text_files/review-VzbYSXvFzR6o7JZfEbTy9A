I am in LOVE and I want one in my town! At first, I only got bites and didn't get one of my own, but YUM! I tried the double chocolate cookie with mint ice cream... the cookies were STILL WARM!!!!! Went back later because I HAD to try it myself. I got 2 warm, white chocolate macadamia nut cookies (you can mix & match, but I am a purist :) with vanilla cinnamon ice cream in the middle. HEAVEN! 2 cookies of your choice (same or different) with ice cream of your choice in the center for just TWO BUCKS?!? ($2) What??? I hope our son picks Cal just so when we come visit we can eat Cream :)", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-19", "type": "review"}
