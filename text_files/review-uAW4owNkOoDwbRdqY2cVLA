I've noticed that you get more or less of the toppings (pickled cabbage, carrots, cucumbers, hummus, etc.) depending on who is working, so depending on my appetite I will sometimes order one and other times order two. Great vegetarian restaurant. Their falafel/chick-pea fritter is as good as it gets in Boston, comparing it to Falafel King (downtown BOS) and Ramis (Coolidge) which I really like, I find myself craving Clover's version more often than the other two. Fries are pretty good if you like the natural taste, remind me of IN-N-OUT fries (for all you westcoast yelpers reading this). I saw a guy eating the sweet potato sandwhich / pita today and it looked really good, he said it was worth passing up on the Chickpea fritter to try this one, so I'm gonna have to try it next time. Their soy bacon is decent, I liked it, but my girlfriend wasn't a big fan.  Their drinks are also great, try the home made hibiscus or lemonade drinks. Great coffee too, and whoopie pies on Fridays after 5 make it a nice treat. Great food, very friendly people that work there too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yr5PAGXB19P1cy9-QJ9IYA"}
