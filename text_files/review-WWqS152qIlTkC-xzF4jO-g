And I don't smoke. Although they also serve salads and sandwiches, make sure you make room for a pastry or three. I have not been able to leave this place with less then three pastries-- usually a couple of macaroons and some kind of cookie. In addition, the sandwiches are also amazing. I highly recommend the open-faced egg salad sandwich. Street parking only but it's usually pretty easy to find, even on a Saturday morning.", "business_id": "UsrKX2305OkmeI7K7cizjA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-06-10", "type": "review"}
