I found Michelle while doing a frantic search online and had called to talk with her about fixing a bolero that I had made elsewhere.  She was so relaxed, and had no problem helping me out.  My wedding was in 11 days!!  The original bolero fit like a paperbag, without shape, and with extremely poor craftsmanship, it had to be trashed.  Michelle used a picture of something I liked and made the new jacket from scratch.  It is so beautiful, I love it. She completed in three days something that I will cherish for the rest of my life and I will wear it many times over! I planned my entire wedding in 28 days.  I had ordered my wedding dress online, since I was trying to get something quickly and didn't have time to deal with bridal stores.  I took my own measurements and apparently didn't do that correctly.  When the dress arrived, 6 days before the wedding, it was nearly three sizes too big.  Michelle took the entire dress down, ruching, gathering, pleating and everything... it fit me like a glove!  She even put in a new heavyweight zipper.  She did all of that in 5 days and I only needed one fitting.  The second time I went in to see the dress, I took it home with me.  She is amazing. Michelle's attention to detail, dressmaking knowledge, quality of workmanship, skill, speed, and customer service cannot be beat.  I have found not only an amazingly talented tailor, but a great friend.  I cannot tell you enough how grateful I am to Michelle for making my wedding dress everything I dreamed it could be.", "business_id": "5TkOJ3fHTuD6tzqWArTjiA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-01", "type": "review"}
