I was literally the only one there other than the cashier and cook. But I decided not to judge since it sorta is in this hidden grottolike location.\n\nI got the lamb tikka masala! My favorite indian dish (other than son naan). It comes with only the sauce and lamb, typical for Indian places and it was about $8. I think it's more expensive than House of Curries/Naan and Curry. \n\nThe place is roomy and really clean! There's a bunch of seating and you can get your own toppings and stuff. Berkeley has plenty of other Indian food locations that I think are a little better", "type": "review", "business_id": "TKDgFp9C7kf_pSHrQHZW_Q"}
