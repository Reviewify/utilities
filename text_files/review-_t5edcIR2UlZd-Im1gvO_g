I was literally the only one there other than the cashier and cook. But I decided not to judge since it sorta is in this hidden grottolike location. I got the lamb tikka masala! My favorite indian dish (other than son naan). It comes with only the sauce and lamb, typical for Indian places and it was about $8. I think it's more expensive than House of Curries/Naan and Curry. The place is roomy and really clean! There's a bunch of seating and you can get your own toppings and stuff. Berkeley has plenty of other Indian food locations that I think are a little better", "business_id": "TKDgFp9C7kf_pSHrQHZW_Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-05", "type": "review"}
