The food ranges from mediocre to very good, with most of the dishes I had being on the very good end of the spectrum. I would not suggest getting the pakoras; they're not as delicious and very dense, meaning they add to your bill quickly. \nItems I particularly liked: the baingan bharta, the bhindi masala, the chana masala.\n\nThere's a small room near the bathroom and sinks where there are two tables isolated from the rest of the chaos in the front of the restaurant. That's where you should eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AqyDXaob6pF7zE2s9nFR2w"}
