I go in to check those out and meet Terry, the really cool owner.  It's a tiny, really cute place stocking reproduction retro style clothing, shoes, and accessories for and women...think pin-ups, skulls, americana tattooes, swallows...the whole nine yards.  I don't really wear retro clothing, but I will carry a cute bag or wear the jewelry. I did leave with some great recommendations of places to eat at and a really cute pair of Draven slip ons (think vans) with swallows on them.", "business_id": "nIGLa67u9eEgOR3eAEUbKA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-01", "type": "review"}
