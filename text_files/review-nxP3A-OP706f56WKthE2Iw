I chose the free range turkey burger special advertised on the entrance door. When it arrived at my table I couldn't believe its size. I got it with the works & was not disappointed. Juicy & flavorful. I made a mess stuffing my face. I usually hate getting soda from a gun but theirs wasn't nasty tasting like most restaurants. The decor is like a dentist's waiting room but my meal more than made up for it. I would definitely stop by for a meal if I'm in the area again.", "business_id": "-1K9xLVS8HnG8n0g7Xq7mQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-11", "type": "review"}
