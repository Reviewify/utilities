My cousin always raved about their carne asada and super nachos so one day out in LA i decided to try it. it was amazing. the prices are reasonable and if you aren't afraid to get shot near the usc campus.. this is the place to go! yummy food.. only place i don't mind getting dirty at. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "m8oV_h-OV3AoPicvieCJEQ"}
