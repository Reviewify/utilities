Apparently, there is no wrong way to eat a grilled cheese. *high-five myself on that cheesy joke* **high-five myself again for making a cheesy joke on a cheesy joke** Oh I could go on...\n\nWill and Pop. I'm back! So the Hell burger from my last challenge is now obviously off the menu, but I did find other inspirations.\n\nDo you like it \"Hipster\" with mango chutney? Do you like it \"Gangsta\" on pulled pork? Maybe you are into \"Hot Hippy Chick,\" jerk chicken w/ guacamole & habanero cheddar? Or perhaps you go \"Ninja\" style, slapping some pepper jelly on duck?\n\nMe? I will forever be an \"Elvis\" fan, and I think about peanut butter, banana slices and bacons, Love Me Tender between two grilled sourdough slices. Personally I love crispy bacons instead of chewy bacons in this, but I'm not All Shook Up about it.\n\nSome of W&P sweets are excellent as well. I love bread pudding, and looking forward to next time at Fullstream so I can try \"Black Forest\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "we-xtVt8oNuy6YIlRPd8nw"}
