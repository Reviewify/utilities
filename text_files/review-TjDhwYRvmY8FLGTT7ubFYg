It's such a treat to go to the Bent Spoon but I've found that in the past year, I've only been there twice because its hard to justify the cost.  There was a student event where free ice cream from the Bent Spoon was being given out and I loved it!\n\nI'd definitely recommend the Bent Spoon and Fruity Yogurt over Thomas Sweets and Twist, respectively.  Check out my reviews of these places to find out why! :)  Thanks for reading.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y0xTHTPtxXTctQEKWVuGpg"}
