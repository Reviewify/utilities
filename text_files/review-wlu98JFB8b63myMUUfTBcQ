The crowd can be hit-or-miss depending on the evening and whether students are in town or not.  It could be hip and chic, or it could be middle aged professor-types.  With precious few spots in the area offering something other than the Irish pub or dive bar scene, it's a welcome change.  The decor is cool, and the windows open to the adjacent park in warm months.", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}
