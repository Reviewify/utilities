The crowd can be hit-or-miss depending on the evening and whether students are in town or not.  It could be hip and chic, or it could be middle aged professor-types.

The decor is cool, and the windows open to the adjacent park in warm months.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A"}
