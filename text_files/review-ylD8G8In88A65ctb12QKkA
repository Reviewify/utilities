A bit far from P-town but worth the drive.  Each time my girlie friends and I have a long weekend get-together we grab several dozens of these delicious little morsels and by the end of our weekend visit we are whacking off the tops and snarfing while no one is lookin'.  Their frosting is the best.  My needs are fairly simple and can be satisfied with a great chocolate cupcake or vanilla and Sprinkles does it right!  Red Velvet is a close runner up.  Eat and enjoy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
