It's tiny, and the dudes behind the counter will help you find stuff and give you suggestions. When it's not busy, without fail they will engage you in a conversation about whatever you're renting, usually delivering a concise, definitive assessment of the sort that the comic book guy does on the Simpson's. Some sort of cult classic is always going on their big-screen, and the cashier is usually actually watching it. On the downside, the selection is a little shabby, and you have to return your video sometimes as soon as the next day, though it is cheaper than Blockbuster's. The other thing is that downstairs is porn. I actually had been going there for several years before my husband pointed this out to me, and it made a lot of things make sense. Like the weird vibe of a lot of the customers there and the no-see-through disk covers they put on what you rent, and the fact that if you're just renting non-porn films, you get the sense that you're not their number one target customer. There's also a masculinist vibe to the store - so that the cashiers are always males, often leathered and tattooed, and the movies on the big screen are usually pieces of extreme violence, and so on. I have a problem with the porn thing. So I find my self weighing \"big corporate chain?\" or \"local chain with porn?\"", "business_id": "x0UyRHil_aBUzlZee9Nrkg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-03", "type": "review"}
