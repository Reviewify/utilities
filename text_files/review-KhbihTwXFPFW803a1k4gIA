We actually had to call our waiter away from the screen a few times.  The TVs are a great idea for date parties where the guys don't really want sushi though.\n\nThe sushi is quite fresh--I like to eat regular sushi before starting in on rolls and whatnot, so I was impressed with the quality of the maguro, toro, and namasake.  However, they put a piece of wasabi between the fish & rice layers--not a problem if you like spicy, but my friend ended up scraping each piece and giving up in frustration.  They should tell you this ahead of time so you don't waste money on good fish.  I would have ordered simple sashimi and asked them to hold the wasabi if I had known.  I like the flavor of the fish alone.\n\nThe rolls were good, but nothing out of this world.  The ambiance was good, but dark--more date-like, IMHO (but the bar-like setup was NOT date-friendly).  The service was decent, but slacking due to inattentiveness.\n\nI gave it 3 stars because there seemed to be a con for every pro.  As I said, I wouldn't mind going to Kubo's, but I would not drive from home to get there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CicSpPgT48Gd9WbsViS2DA"}
