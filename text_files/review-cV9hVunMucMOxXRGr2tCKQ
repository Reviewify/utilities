I want a soup. I havent seen of heard of  Sweet Tomatos since I've been in L.A. Until alas I gush my feelings and my beau says \"theres a Soup Plantation, its the same thing\". Success. We cruise on over and enter the line, an extremely long line. Salad bar with all the fixins. I pay the 25 bucks for the two of us and we are seated. I had two bowls of the Pinto Bean adn Brown Rice Soup. Its an awesome soup if you dont desire meat. Theres Chili, Black Bean Chili, and Chicken Noodle along with many others. I treated myself to a nice roll of sweet corn bread and a pumpernickel (I believe--its exactly like the sweet brown bread served at Cheesecake Factory) with bits of an anonymous red berry. This dinner hit the spot.", "business_id": "B6N85aXcF3FfYixZvaEVwQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-13", "type": "review"}
