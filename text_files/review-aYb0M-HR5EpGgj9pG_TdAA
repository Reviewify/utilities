This is the opposite of the 35er or The Colorado.  Drink prices are steep and that is what attracts the attractive female crowd, which in turn gets the guys to show up.\n\nThe service is terrible, unless you go to the bar and order yourself.  The service staff are concerned with those that order food and drinks and tend to ignore all that order just drinks.\n\nI like this place in my mix when I want to see attractive people, but sometimes you just want the cheap drinks, and this place is not that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WbghvrJETTvt9p7nPcfjAQ"}
