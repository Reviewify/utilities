I have had the sandwiches before and after the ownership changed, and the only difference I see in the sandwich is the price. \n\nI always thought it was just me, but after reading some of these reviews I see I'm not the only one who feels the staff could be friendlier. \n\nIn my many experiences at the Cheese House, I have found that the staff  pretend to not see you waiting at the counter, and like one other person said, the owner has to tell them to go help you. In addition, I always feel like I am inconveniencing or somehow annoying them when I place my order. It's so obvious, that someone should really say something, but it's not a good idea to be rude to people who handle your food. I'm assuming the owners are aware of the behavior, why has it not changed yet?\n\nIf you don't like making sandwiches, go work somewhere else.\n\nUpdate: After seeing a picture of the owners on their website, I can now say I've never seen the owners in the store. The woman with blonde hair who I've seen numerous times now must be a manager, and not someone I'd keep on staff if I owned the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cnNKs5mq3JhA-Rr_lbRoWw"}
