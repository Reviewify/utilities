Well, Cafe Japengo has the BEST California roll you will ever have and is truly something to get excited about! The rolls are packed with moist, soft crab that seems to have been MASSAGED VERY FINELY between the chef's fingers! (The real secret is probably just a bit of mayonnaise on top of real, good quality shellfish.) During Happy Hour (ALL DAY Saturday and Sunday at the bar! W00t!!), the Calif rolls are only $4, so it's definitely worth a try then! Another appetizer/Happy Hour standout is the curry dusted calamari (with lime vinaigrette and chukka salad). It comes in a big round cocktail glass, layered with seaweed salad, cucumbers, cellophane noodles. It's almost a meal on its own! My companion and I got this as part of the Japengo sampler plate, which also had shrimp dumplings (with coriander-mint pesto and ponzu) and spring rolls. Apart from Happy Hour and the Bar (which has tables and an outdoor patio, so you don't feel like you're at a bar per se), full dinner entrees at Cafe Japengo in the dining room are great (with first-rate service) but the food is not as memorable as Japengo's sushi and Happy Hour.", "business_id": "baeBGUjh035MU3UkHvp8Vg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-03", "type": "review"}
