This little diner in Menands is right across the street from News Channel 13. The parking lot is the size of a driveway and a disaster to try and park in; I got frustrated within 2 seconds and parked on the street. The outside has a cute little patio that I assume is equipped with tables during the warmer months. Inside is adorable. There are about 30 different light fixtures hanging from the tin ceilings and the are all tiffany style fixtures. The free standing tables have white linens and the booth have some very nice tapestry upholstery on the seats. The breakfast menu is limited standard breakfast fare. However, the 2 meals ordered at our table were just lovely. The pancakes were clearly made from scratch and were light and fluffy. They were supposed to be blueberry pancakes; I was a bit disappointed as I like lots of blueberries and there were too few, but the pancakes were yummy. My \"Little Sister\" got the waffle and devoured the whole thing and said it was light and fluffy (not a belly bomber). The one thing I don't understand is why a restaurant will go through the effort of making breakfast foods from scratch only to serve it with imitation maple flavored corn syrup. (OK, I do understand why, the real stuff is expensive, but it is so much better). The coffee was terrible. My \"Little Sister\" loved her hot chocolate. The service was fine, but it was clear that there were a lot of regulars in there and the waitress was definitely more attentive to them then to us, but it wasn't like we needed anything so I'll limit that complaint. All in all, it was a nice change for breakfast. I'll go back again to try lunch/dinner some time.", "business_id": "S6rauZOfTuU2SbqMKYORfQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-02", "type": "review"}
