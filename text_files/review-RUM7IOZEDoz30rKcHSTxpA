(ok, i do understand why, the real stuff is expensive, but it is so much better). the coffee was terrible. my \"little sister\" loved her hot chocolate. the service was fine, but it was clear that there were a lot of regulars in there and the waitress was definitely more attentive to them then to us, but it wasn't like we needed anything so i'll limit that complaint. all in all, it was a nice change for breakfast. i'll go back again to try lunch/dinner some time.", "business_id": "S6rauZOfTuU2SbqMKYORfQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-02", "type": "review"}
