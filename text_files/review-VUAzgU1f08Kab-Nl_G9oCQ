The place is OK... just ok. It has a grungey theme to the place which I don't find to be all that appealing. The music is ok, almost sounds like they're playing it straight off the radio or something. The place is very small. The dancefloor is tiny.  I wouldn't choose this place to go out to or anything.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HWF9p8o1QaYnDKTdux7QYQ"}
