Just not great. Three of us went and one had the Pulled Chicken Plate and two of us had the Beef Brisket Plate. The sides of BBQ Baked Beans, Mashed Potatoes and Coleslaw were all very good with no complaints. We were all split on how good the corn bread was. \n\nOne complaint is that the Beef Brisket was dry (on two different visits for one of us, this was a problem). The bbq sauce is good and helps but you just can't undo what is already done (or over-done). I have read that good brisket needs no sauce on it just on the side. This would not have been possible with this brisket. \n\nOur other complaint was with the pulled chicken. It too was dry. They used all white meat and the bbq sauce was drizzled on top of the chicken. A simple solution could be to mix some bbq sauce in with the pulled chicken so that while it sits over heat waiting to be ordered it does not dry out.   \n\nWe will go back and the flavors were all good but dry meat is not great or appetizing to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hs1bNW1pkKYGoXQ39P2Ffw"}
