Well, it's more like a shack.I ordered the spareribs and combo plates.  They were delicious! the meat in the combo plate was juicy and the korean ribs were tasty.  They give you a large portion of rice and meat with a side of salad and kimchi.   I definitely need to eat here again before i leave LA", "business_id": "g-B5qeJ0V9mTKrM9Ekr7BA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-14", "type": "review"}
