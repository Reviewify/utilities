It's consistent, it's decently priced, it's fast, it's Niman Ranch meat, it's crispy CRINKLE CUT FRIES WITH THINNED OUT RANCH and it's CRISPY BUNZZZ!!! Yes, warm crispy toasty sesame seeded buns, where else does this exist no where that's why Bongo Burger get's a five. Try it they way I like it: hold the mustard and raw onions and you got gold baby. Oh, and their Mediterranean stuff is pretty tasty too.", "business_id": "G3d-xJF_Rt-P_za2eZ1q-Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-26", "type": "review"}
