Whether it is a weekend brunch or an early dinner, we are always thrilled about the food.  Everything is served fresh and with wholesome ingredients. The cooking is superb.   We are ok with paying a bit more for quality food because we think it is worth it- and let's face it, for those of us who cook regularly, we know the ingredients are expensive!   Go to Panzanella for brunch and you will never go back to Elmo's.....For those who say it is too nice to take the children- I would rethink this.  I grew up without a lot of money but my parents took us once in a while to fabulous restaurants because they respected us as people and wanted to share with us a love for beautifully prepared food.  Every time we go to Panzenella we are surrounded by families (especially our early dinners) and I can tell they feel the same way that I do about their children.", "business_id": "xwyJUcRY0hNlLY0PDqZhlA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}
