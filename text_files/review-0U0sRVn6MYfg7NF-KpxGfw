But hey I don't mind, the workers here are like newspaper printing presses, they just keep stuffing and folding those burritos like they could do it in their sleep.\n\nI usually don't review places like this because one Chipotle isn't gonna be much different than another, BUT I make an exception for this Chipotle because they really stuffed my burrito. I mean this was massive, bigger than usual. Who knows, maybe it's just been so long but it definitely seemed like they wanted me to be full for hours. Thanks, Chipotle Greenbelt!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tDRW4On5HGiV3mABQSGx7Q"}
