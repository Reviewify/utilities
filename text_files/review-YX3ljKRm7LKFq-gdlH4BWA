Specifically, the fried rice here is amazing. While I realize that most of this amazingness is due to grease and MSG, I can't resist this restaurant and always find myself coming back. My most favorite thing is the salt fish and chicken fried rice...it is delicious, comforting, and reminds me of home. I honestly can't ask for anything better than that and to me, that's what makes this restaurant a 4-star restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_mv3DhRD3L3okFXYjxX_Cg"}
