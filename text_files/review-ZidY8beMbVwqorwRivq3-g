It is a valuable resource when i am about to travel somewhere as close as Maine or as far away as India. It is also an ideal place to leaf through an excellent selection of maps and travel writing. They get great authors to come and speak about their experiences traveling to different parts of the world, which I also recommend. My advice is to pick up a random book from their \"staff picks\" table (discounted 20%) like \"Unlikely Destinations: The Lonely Planet Story\" or Rory Stewart's \"The Places in Between,\" then stroll up to the second floor of Cafe Algiers with yr new book and get lost in dreamy thoughts of foreign lands.", "business_id": "clYZvXRKi4S6E6CGBF3n_Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-07-28", "type": "review"}
