I was expecting greatness but was kind of let down, yet I wasn't completely disappointed. To start off, the variety is really good in terms of drinks and food and that was my favorite thing about this place. Next, the service was really good. However, the price is kind of ridiculous if you like meat in your noodles, because that cost extra and adding steak was like $3. Overall I'd say the price is probably not worth it unless you are really craving some noodles.", "business_id": "7SLHQDbrpp7XPKVsPfuiqg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-24", "type": "review"}
