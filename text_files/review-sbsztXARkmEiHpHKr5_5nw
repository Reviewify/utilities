I came to Haruki Express because I wanted Asian food, was on Waterman, and a quick perusal of Yelp reviews showed that it had an entire star over Spice Thai.  I was planning on getting sushi, so maybe if I'd done that I'd have a better opinion of the restaurant.  However, today's special was chicken fried rice, spicy basil and regular varieties.  Why it was a special, I don't know, since there was no special deal, but maybe it's not on the regular menu. My first warning flag came when I ordered and asked for it with no onions.  The cashier told me that it is all premixed at the beginning of the day and then heated up.  As a result, they were necessarily included, but  there weren't many.  I thought that was not ideal, but I figured it might be standard practice. It came out, and I thought the heating would take place in a pan.  No no, it just gets shoved in a microwave.  It was  loaded with onions and dripping in oil.  On my way out, the cashier asked how I'd liked it, and I told her it was onion-filled and oily, so not great.  She responded that she might have left it in the microwave for too long (!), and that the non-spicy version was less oily than the one I'd chosen. Based on the quality itself, I probably would have given Haruki Express two stars, but I went there an hour or two ago and my stomach still hurts.  I shall not be returning.", "business_id": "KU3o2bfHa-igvS7DgnpzDw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}
