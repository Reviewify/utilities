However, I have failed to ever find anything here I wish to purchase, which is a total bummer! The staff is pretty sweet and I like talking to them while I am selling clothes. One thing that I find to be a huge gripe though, is depending on who is the buyer, depends on if they take your item and for how much. I feel like I am pretty style-savvy (I am sure EEEEvvvEEEeerryyoonee selling clothes thinks they are, haha), but I know they have turned down hardly (If ever) worn clothing and then a manager will come over and say to buy it. So if said person isn't around your item gets the rejection. On top of that, when perusing the racks after you've been rejected, you find hole-y, armpit stained, totally out of style clothing that is way worse than your offerings, I get slightly miffed!
