I had a killer craving for chorizo and eggs one morning to cure a hangover.  Not only was the chorizo perfectly cooked with the eggs, but it came with delicious beans, rice and a very generous helping of tortillas to eat it with.  I also bought some candy and a strawberry Boing! drink and the total was only $7.50.  Very reasonably priced and worth every bite!  Breakfast this great tasting would cost a lot more anywhere else.   Everything tasted delicious, and I am excited to try their pozole (a hominy soup) and tamales, which the (really nice) guy working said was all homemade in the shop. BOYCOTT CHIPOTLE AND QDOBA!  Go to El Charro and eat real Mexican food.", "business_id": "8GUMO244E8CxfJcyJIWFOA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-24", "type": "review"}
