It was casual, quick, and one of the only places that had belly dancers during lunch.  That was a big winner for me!  The food wasn't the best I've had, but it was alright.  I think one of the best perks that I had is that they would always ask me \"JPL discount?\"  Even though I didn't work for JPL, I would always say \"YES!\".  Even though I'm not smart enough to work at JPL, I AM smart enough to know the response to that question.  Maybe it was the whole Asian-must-be-an-engineer thing I have going for me that elicited that question from them, but hey, I'll take it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5rTrfWtd1Isl0v8OK_iiCw"}
