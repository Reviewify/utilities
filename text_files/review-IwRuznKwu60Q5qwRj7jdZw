It may be a little grimy and rough around the edges, but it makes up for this where it counts. They make good cheese steaks, and that's the bottom line. It really feels like a neighborhood fixture, as they have more personality in a few faded photographs than the Chilies next store no matter how much goofy stuff they put on the walls. Additionally, the prices won't hurt your wallet, as you can expect to pay half what you would down at Geno's or Pats. The staff is friendly and the food is good. You won't loose any weight eating here but that's why it's good. If you want to double your temptation, they have a decent beer selection and sell by the bottle or the case. Overall, Abner's is a fine place to hang out with some college friends and catch some highlights on ESPN, satisfy that late night cheese steak craving, or exchange your basketball tickets for a free soda to wind down the evening.", "business_id": "o996tDYd0KRgeuY9mDeAGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-08", "type": "review"}
