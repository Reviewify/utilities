He knows that I love steak, so I'm guessing he just yelped steak restaurants in the Pasadena area, and came up with Malbec.  We had reservations for 2 at 6pm, and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  The interior d\u00e9cor of this place is very nice; dark, classy, romantic.  Although I do wish that the couple tables were a little bit further apart; there was at most about a foot in between our tables, and I could definitely hear conversations on both sides of me.  The service, however, was impeccable. As an appetizer, I ordered the Almejas y Mejillones Provenzal, which is fresh clams and mussels steamed with butter, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, and wine.  I found it to be quite tasty, but then again, you can't really go wrong with such a classic dish.  I do wish the clams and mussels were slightly larger though.  For my appetizer, I went with the Bife al Malbec, which is their New York Steak with mushrooms and roasted potatoes.  My boyfriend ordered the Entrana al Chimichurri, the skirt steak with grilled veggies.  Although my New York Steak was cooked pretty well, I really did not like the signature Malbec sauce that came with it.  The sauce was just a little bit too sweet for my taste, and I felt like it took away from the flavors of the steak.  My potatoes, however, were roasted to perfection.  I ended up switching dishes with my boyfriend because he could tell that I was not enjoying my food too much.  Now, the skirt steak, I liked more.  It was grilled very well, and the sauce was just what I wanted.  I wouldn't say it's the best steak I've ever had, but it was decent.  I'm not sure if I'll be back though.", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-18", "type": "review"}
