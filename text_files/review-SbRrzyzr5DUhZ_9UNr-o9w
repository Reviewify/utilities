I'm a chocolate addict, so I'm obviously biased but L.A Burdick's is awesome. I've been here twice. The first time I had the dark hot chocolate which was very good but a little too dark for my taste. The second time I had the milk hot chocolate, it was perfect. I even got a little bag of their shaved chocolate to make my own. Excellent place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "gctbL0lDIYIHM6yDn99V-g"}
