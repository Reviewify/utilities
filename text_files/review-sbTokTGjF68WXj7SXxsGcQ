Their drink special got me every time! Why buy an Arizona tea when you can get a fresh Jasmine Milk Tea with pearls?! Their 2 drinks for $3 was awesome and you can mix/match the black, jasmine or thai milk teas. The owners are very nice and the drinks taste great! I also remember asking them what type of milk they use and they said it was lactose-free so for those that are lactose intolerant, it's not excuse to not try this place :)  The only downside is that their pearls are sometimes inconsistent but when they're fresh, they are heaven! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "k9UPupjrpa-y_e1urlAMnA"}
