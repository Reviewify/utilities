It's amazingly fresh and great... Little pricey for my taste but a treat for sure... Buffet is big and no two dishes taste the same which is really hard to find at many of the places around. Dinner portions are good and tasty. Mind well they can make any food spicy if asked. Again Pricey. Atmosphere is good and people are good. Very warm... Decor is good... Best place in Chapel Hill for Indian food....", "business_id": "RMSSpyOX7rEAjUoKI4Svqg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-04", "type": "review"}
