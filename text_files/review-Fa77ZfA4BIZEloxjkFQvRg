Great produce, an amazing deli, a fantastic bakery, a classy mini food court with fresh and tasty food, and nearly any kind of specialty food the average Ithacan, non-native, or adventurous eater desires.  Did I mention there's an entire back area devoted to nothing but CANDY?  It's like the Disneyland of grocery stores (and thus the perfect place to play The Wegmans Game).  And much like the land of Disney, this place is frequently crowded.  Never go between 4 and 7 on a weeknight, and never go on Saturday or Sunday until later in the evening--too many people!  \n\nThe only downside to good old Weggies is that it can be a little pricey.  I tended to do my produce shopping here and get everything else at P&C or someplace else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wxx427QN8J7J03_T2EugaA"}
