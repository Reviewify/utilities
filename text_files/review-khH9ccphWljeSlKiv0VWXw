Went here for a birthday, where we were the only ones in the restaurant. You'd think that they could get this right... but you'd be wrong. I ordered quiche -- but it was cold (nearly frozen). Some people at my table just never got parts of their meal -- pom frittes and a salad. And instead of bringing them, they just gave an extra glass of wine. Which they charged for. However, t the end of the meal, the waiter couldn't keep straight who had paid and how much. So he fussed with the checks in a very vocal way, and via some very dubious math came up with us owing over $100 ... after we already paid. Ate here once and already feel that I've paid for three meals. Will never go here again.", "business_id": "YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-19", "type": "review"}
