You'd think that they could get this right... but you'd be wrong.\n\nI ordered quiche -- but it was cold (nearly frozen).  Some people at my table just never got parts of their meal -- pom frittes and a salad.  And instead of bringing them,  they just gave an extra glass of wine.  Which they charged for.\n\nHowever, t the end of the meal, the waiter couldn't keep straight who had paid and how much.  So he fussed with the checks in a very vocal way, and via some very dubious math came up with us owing over $100 ... after we already paid.\n\nAte here once and already feel that I've paid for three meals. Will never go here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q"}
