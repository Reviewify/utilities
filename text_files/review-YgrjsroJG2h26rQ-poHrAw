After my office moved further West, I was concerned that I'd never make the 20 minute jaunt to 33rd and Spruce, but I was also determined to hit it up. Recent news that it was under new management had me concerned. I planned a lunch with a coworker to make the trip down Spruce and investigate the \"newly\" managed truck.\n\nI showed up a little before 12, to beat the lines that I had witnessed before, and we had no wait. I ordered one chicken basil Thai taco and one pork bun. I liked the 9 of spades that they handed me as my \"number;\" it was a cute touch. I didn't like the syrofoam containers they served the food in. Come on, Philly food trucks, let's get green! I personally think there should be a tax break for food trucks that use paper/compostable containers as it will just encourage greener behaviors. Just sayin.\n\nAnyway, on to the main event: the food. I dove into the pork \"bun\" first, which was a pillowy, round piece of bread (?), on top of which was a flavorful but tiny piece of pork, some scallions, cilantro, and perhaps some other stuff too. I didn't deconstruct it to much because I was too busy inhaling the delectable thing. It wasn't spicy at all, but very flavorful. The taco was a little spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle (I am a lightweight, FYI). It was served with a delicious sauce, some fresh basil leaves, cabbage and a few slices of radish. It was fantastic. I think I liked the pork bun a little more, but the taco was the healthier morsel.\n\nHad I been any hungrier, I would have either ordered a third option, or brought along an apple as one taco and one pork \"bun\" would not be enough to sustain me. I will definitely be back. A friend has told me to order the special Bee-zilla as it will change my life and I'm determined to do so.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F48wjJ_jjEz59Prh20XhRA"}
