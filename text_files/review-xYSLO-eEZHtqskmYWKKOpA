The reality is its a burrito place that is cheap and quick. \n\nIf you're working on budget for under $5 you can get one of the many veggie burrito options, or the vegan platter. Under $10, and you can get pretty much anything on the menu. I like the roasted veggie burrito, or quesadilla. The spinach and Mushroom quesadilla is also surprisingly good. I've often had it with real mushrooms and fresh spinach. My suggestion is if you like sour cream add it by itself. If you get delux anything you're basically tacking on a $1.50 or so for a spoon full of guacamole... which although good, highly over priced. \n\nThe atmosphere is anything but cosmic, and feels more deep down to earth, like in the mud. Its a bit ramshackle and because they're dealing with high volume sometimes the tables are dirty from the past few groups of patrons. Though if you catch them on an off time between the lunch and dinner rush, or before the bar crowd its not much of an issue. As a big guy seating stability is something I notice. I sit lightly on those chairs, but most people shouldn't have trouble. Its authentic hole in the wall,  and a staple if you're in the area and need to get lunch on the go, but don't expect much and you you'll be sure to leave satisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "142ixzjxpVi7VxR27Dsm0Q"}
