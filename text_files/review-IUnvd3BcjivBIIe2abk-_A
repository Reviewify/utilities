Only have placed delivery orders from my work. The lunch specials are great!! The lunch specials come with an eggroll and a salad (comprised of two pieces of ice berg lettuce and shreds of red cabbage) that I always try to pass on to some one else, so I can't entirely say anything about that. The main entrees though are pretty decent. I like it there becuase when you say spicy, it is spicy. They are pretty on point about the level on spicyness. At some places I've been to you want it spicy hot and its barely even medium. I've had their pad thai, the curry both green and red, basil leaves chicken with chili, their satay, and seafood fried rice and all hit the thai \"fast food\" spot. Prices are excellent! you can't really beat a 6.45 lunch special that delivers so I can't complain much. The only bad experience i've had was with their Tom Yum Mixed Veg soup. I was sick and I wanted soup. I think I was expecting something else, so it wasn't very tasty to me so I ended up throwing it out. But your tastebuds are all screwy when you're sick, so I should give it a do-over.", "business_id": "7fqyfAKK36pjoeMyOD-XVQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-23", "type": "review"}
