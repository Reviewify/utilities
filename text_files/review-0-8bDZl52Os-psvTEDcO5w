Amazingly flavorful and delicious!  The owner is super helpful and extremely passionate about what he does and teaching others about the specialness of Ethiopia food.  The place is super small but I kinda love the coziness.  I highly recommend this and know you'll love the whole experience...enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0A3irNk0Kb3vQasADoQCHw"}
