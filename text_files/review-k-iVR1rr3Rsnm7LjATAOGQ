Tearing open a paper bag of glorious, glorious shortbread cookies.  That my sister and I combed the entire store to find.\n\nThere is silence as we stand by the bed of the pick-up truck.  Lost in the taste of the decadent cookies.  Mmmmmmmm.\n\nIn my peripheral vision, an un-manned shopping cart loaded with treasures rolls down the lot.  Neither of us move.\n\n\"Have you seen my cart.?\" a frantic woman approaches us.\n\nBoth stand still.  And point.  Hey, don't blame us, our mouths are full!", "type": "review", "business_id": "6vxPFIAUmOUFXerEmGRdiQ"}
