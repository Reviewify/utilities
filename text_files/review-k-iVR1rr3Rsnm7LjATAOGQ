Tearing open a paper bag of glorious, glorious shortbread cookies. That my sister and I combed the entire store to find. There is silence as we stand by the bed of the pick-up truck. Lost in the taste of the decadent cookies. Mmmmmmmm. In my peripheral vision, an un-manned shopping cart loaded with treasures rolls down the lot.
