We had a bottle of wine ($40), I had the burger and she had the crabcake sandwich- with tip, around $40 each.  Service was good and the waitress didn't rush us.  Overall, the food was solid but not amazing, maybe a little high on price, but it's Harvard square.  I would come back, but mostly for the deck.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E_vKoJ0zvpfAcEkQGS4d2A"}
