I'm sure that once the school year hits, this place will be swamped with Columbia students.  Being new in the neighborhood, I need to find the good bars, and I love a good dive bar.  I would say that 1020 classifies as such.  \n\nDart board up front, pool table in the back, barley lit bar area, small booths along the side and a few more tables and benches around the sides.  Cheap PBR and Schlitz, good happy hour deals, all the great makings of a dive bar, and a good bar.\n\nThe music was also pretty solid through the course of the night. Mostly reggae. Supposedly they play indie movies on the tv's/in the back, but they were showing baseball, which is ok by me.  \n\nI think I will add this to the list of bars I will be giving my business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ErMFay-6o83QB2P1k4ALAg"}
