We both got the regular size, which is huge; neither of us was able to finish our food.\n\nThis is alright food, and the portions and price are right on, but it's ultimately forgettable.  I dropped an initial three-star rating down a star for two reasons: The fact that my mom and I both had gurgling stomachs and felt slightly sick after our lunch here, and the fact that if all you want is a casual salad meal there's a Whole Foods in the adjacent shopping complex that has a much larger salad bar with organic options and a wider selection of salad fixings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qFfO4D-BwkU3bsfIbMIbpw"}
