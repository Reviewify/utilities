Just like the name suggests, it is nice and dark inside. Cool music, but it is not so loud that it overpowers conversations. Its just right. \n\nI didnt get any food, but I had the jungle captive. It was not a sweet and juicy drink like I expected-- they don't short you on the alcohol. But it was also $10 and had a lot of ice. \n\nIts a bit pricey, but if you can afford it this is a fun, relaxed place to hang out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HrED44acwUngPkOWS0GUZg"}
