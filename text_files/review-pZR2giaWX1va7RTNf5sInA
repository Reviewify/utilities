I don't think so, though true, it is a little run-down. GREAT hamburgers and pies. Hamburgers: it's the quality of the meat, and then what you put on a burger that makes one different from another. And I like the way they make them here, so five stars. And the pies I've ordered are wonderful--how they keep the bottom crusts so crisp is a mystery to me. Not a fan of the fountain cokes; not fizzy enough for me, and I can taste chlorine inthe water they use. Or I imagine I can. It's not cheap, that's for sure; I feel as though maybe 30% of what I'm paying for is the real estate. In any case, it can add up fast--but it's worth it. Breakfast is wonderful--except for the highly resistable potatoes, but you can substitute fruit for those. And did you know that you can customize a breakfast? \"One egg, one slice of toast (homemade bread!), one piece of bacon.\" It's not all giant platters of food! Several of the waitresses are very nice.", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-05-15", "type": "review"}
