I don't think so, though true, it is a little run-down.  GREAT hamburgers and pies.  Hamburgers: it's the quality of the meat, and then what you put on a burger that makes one different from another.  And I like the way they make them here, so five stars.  And the pies I've ordered are wonderful--how they keep the bottom crusts so crisp is a mystery to me.\n\nNot a fan of the fountain cokes; not fizzy enough for me, and I can taste chlorine inthe water they use.  Or I imagine I can.\n\nIt's not cheap, that's for sure; I feel as though maybe 30% of what I'm paying for is the real estate.  In any case, it can add up fast--but it's worth it.\n\nBreakfast is wonderful--except for the highly resistable potatoes, but you can substitute fruit for those.  And did you know that you can customize a breakfast?  \"One egg, one slice of toast (homemade bread!), one piece of bacon.\"   It's not all giant platters of food!\n\nSeveral of the waitresses are very nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q"}
