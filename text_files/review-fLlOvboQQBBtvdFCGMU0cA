The thai iced tea - deliciously cold, but the tap water in a cup - not so much.  The tables were a bit small, but the food wasn't bad. Beef pad see ew, duck curry, and a papaya salad were the choices tonight. The pad see ew was delicious, although a bit salty, and the noodles were cut to a size that was a bit too large to handle neatly.  The duck curry was good, but it wasn't spicy (despite the description), and the papaya salad is one of the few things that you can get there not so much from other places, but only had two shrimp...  will have to go back to try the rice pudding with mango, though, that looked delicious.", "business_id": "aRKDmJRynUacchS2_3yFKQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-21", "type": "review"}
