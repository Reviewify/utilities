I tried some the other day and their cookies just melt in my mouth as I devour one by one. Although I wished I could have more since they quickly ran out from my hand. Their service, on the most part, pretty amazing. I placed a delivery for my girlfriend the a week ago, they were supposed to deliver on Friday, but since I heard nothing about the delivery (it was supposed to be a surprise gift for her and she didn't respond) I got worried and looked at my receipt via email. It said until NEXT Friday and I was like \"Holy Crap!!!\" Soooooo, I quickly get on the phone, call them, explain my situation that it was on my part that the order was placed wrong and like that, they told me that everything, including a dozen of cookies, a pint of Blue Bell ice cream and some special wrapping, will be done in less than an hour and delivered. I was amazed on how quickly and flexible they are on their deliveries. Although they are a bit pricey, you can't go wrong with Tiff's Treats. They have excellent cookies, an easy to use online service, punctual delivery time, and a flexible customer service that could help you on almost anything. :)", "business_id": "IM15oB7zInJytQk2BfKRrg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-27", "type": "review"}
