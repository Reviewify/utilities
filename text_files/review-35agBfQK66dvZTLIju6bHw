At least it was a decent photo! \n\nI was on the search for somewhere to take family visiting from out of town, and lo and behold- recalled that it was Midtown Restaurant Week! Dogwood's menu looked appealing & I thought it would have a vibe the 'rents would enjoy (read: not extremely loud). \n\nAs other reviewers mentioned, the space is lovely - very calm. Decorated in a lot of creams and dark woods, the kind of place you don't want to spill a glass of red wine. Just as their vibe is contemporary Southern, I'd describe the decor as contemporary classic. Plush seats, round tables that are great for a party of six, too. Decor is simple, with some black & white photos of, what else but dogwoods, and artwork. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and professional, and service is what you want at a place like this - timely but not too fast. \n\nThe absolute favorite of mine? The grits bar! As a starter (and in true Southern fashion) you can get grits with one of three toppings. . . and these grits topped the charts on my \"Top Grits\" chart! \n\nGlad to hear they are open for lunch - this for sure has 'business lunch' written all over it! A lovely space, and literally it was impossible to tell that they had been open for just shy of a month, as the experience/service was flawless.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y9A0DQDz37RPFe1sIKkO7Q"}
