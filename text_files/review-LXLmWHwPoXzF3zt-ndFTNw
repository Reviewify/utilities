I've been here three times and there has been plenty new to see each time.  I don't need to say much, since it's all covered in the previous reviews, but I'd come here on a regular basis even if they charged admission, which they don't.  Parking is also free.  Go on a nice day and explore the campus too.  Or go on a not-so-nice day as an inexpensive indoor activity.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BOXMGHigA-fvRjwPRBCdGQ"}
