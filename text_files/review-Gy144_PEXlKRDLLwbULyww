I'm not entirely sure that fancy chopsticks and a tasteful decor make up for the priciness of the food.  The awesome service may somewhat balance it out I suppose.\n\nWhile tasty, the food lacked in spiciness despite the fact that my Partner In Cuisine and I ordered a 9 and an 8 respectively.  I also felt the portions were rather small considering the price we were paying for noodles.  I think that we'll return on occasion, but at those prices, I don't think we'll ever be considered \"regulars.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "749lGtWM9PsrWonlVY4W2w"}
