Burgers and sandwiches taste pretty great. The \"Classic Burgers\" are great if you're looking for something cheap and just as filling as the other items. Not that I'm an expert on Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, the ones here tasted great the last time I ordered it. Make sure you try the Cajun fries, cause they are the same price as the regular fries.\n\nI have to say though, it's the slowest \"fast food\" restaurant I know of. Even when you're the only customer there, the simplest order of burger and fries will take at least 10 minutes. This only gets worse when there are people waiting ahead of you. I'm sure this depends on who is working there at a time, but they also have the tendency of getting your orders wrong when it's even a tad busy.\n\nBut all considered, it's a great place to eat on lunches and late nights. It might be a little slow, but food is usually worth it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BfGlv6S_Is6OkIoOngAnLQ"}
