Whether you're ravenous or in the mood for an appetizer with a drink, you'll be pleased in both circumstances.  Even better is that it's reasonably-priced. And the desserts are top-notch! (Their carrot cake is out of this world.)\n\nThe atmosphere is really laid-back, and it's the perfect place to go with friends or family when you just want to catch up over some comfort food and beer.\n\nSure, it isn't for everyone--I can see how some people would find the ambiance kind of dated. But I think of it as classic. And, c'mon, who doesn't love dining amid some ficus plants every once and a while?\n\nI make it a point to visit Gullifty's every time I'm in Pittsburgh. (Which will hopefully be again soon!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "kKFUNcLklJ54zZNUk-7yjQ"}
