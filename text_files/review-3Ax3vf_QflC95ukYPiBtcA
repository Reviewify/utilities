Immediately following our general commencement (yay Class of 08!), two of my bestest friends and I skipped the hoity toity hors d'oeuvres served in the Campanile Esplanade and headed straight for The Bear's Lair. We were greeted by a wave of applause from the burly 3pm drinking crew (thanks guys!) and the three of us feasted on BLUE and GOLD nachos with chicken, a dozen white castle burgers, and a big pitcher of Jupiter Hefeweizen! It was the perfect way to celebrate 4 fantastic years at the greatest university in the world! GO BEARS!!!", "business_id": "s2Wb3UxXVPU9CV0R2shSuA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-16", "type": "review"}
