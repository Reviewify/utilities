Hotel is in a good location in Atlanta - convenient to lots.\n\nStayed in a two room suite, which was nice, but could have been improved upon as well. The vertical blinds in the bedrooms did not block out much of the morning light and there was lots as we were staying on one of the top floors. The bath stopper did not work so showers were the only option (probably fine for most).\n\nThe sliding glass doors to the balconies were not very secure and we found a living room window was not properly locked  - we could simply slide it open if we felt like trying a bad version of base jumping. We did lock it after some scary maneuvering, but why have an open window like that? I have not been in a hotel where there were not safeguards on upper floor windows in forever, but it led me to a curious search of Atlanta hotel codes...\n\nRoom included an older washer and dryer, which worked. Full kitchen with no utensils, dinnerware, etc. I am guessing if you asked they might provide for a long term stay.\n\nLovely pool area on the roof, but no locker room for guests that I found. If you want to shower (as \"required\") before entering the pool, not sure if you should do so in your room first or what.\n\nElevators can take a long time, particularly if you are on an upper floor. Parking was somewhat expensive and you have to compete for spaces with patrons of the adjacent Fox Theater. If you time your arrival wrong, you will also be competing with those same patrons just to pull into the driveway.\n\nStaff was mixed as well.  Some more responsive and friendly than others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IWZg1OfbxbNZ10LhOTHfww"}
