Then for only about 4.50, I can get a big burger and a heaping order of fries!\n\nWould I pay full price for food here? Probably not. \n\nBut if you like rabbit food, the salads here are humongous. Like you may need two people to eat it. \n\nThe soup I ordered once was satisfying too.\n\nSo really, only come here when you can take advantage of the deal I just told you about and you will leave satisfied.\n\nOh and it's cash only FYI.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q0j0-u8WHHczEg5c9DPQKg"}
