The food here is not bad. Pretty hefty rolls for the price. But I cannot rant enough about the service in this place. I've probably eaten here for the last time. My co-workers and I waited a good 40 minutes for our food while we watched and complained about others being seated, getting their food and leaving in that same time span. So the \"sorry, we're really busy\" doesn't cut it. They seem extremely unorganized. A mistake was made on our order and we were given someone else's bill. I see that others have complained about the service. If they weren't in a business park, I doubt they would survive.", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-01-17", "type": "review"}
