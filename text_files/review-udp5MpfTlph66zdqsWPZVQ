Not the worst. Better than what you can get elsewhere in the area.\n\nThe food is... Well, let's start with the fact that the person who made it had to ask another person working there if the food looked cooked to him. I mean, sure, if you're new or whatever and have to do that that's fine. But please don't do that where I can hear you. I'd like to at least think you're confident in not undercooking meat.\n\nWorse: the experienced coworker didn't even look at it, and just said \"if you followed the directions it's good\".\n\nEven worse: it came out cold. Well, certainly not warm.\n\nFrom the combination of the cashier knowing that it takes exactly 11 minutes for my food to be ready and the texture/taste of the food I'm pretty sure that all the food they serve are just frozen buns/dumplings that you can get at Asian grocery stores. That's cool, I guess, but not when you charge the prices they do.\n\nEDIT: The owner wrote me a nice message regarding this review. Turns out the employees were both trainees and the supervisor was out at the time. Completely reasonable---LimeRed is not the only establishment in the town of Amherst that has dips like these on weekend afternoons when the employees are part time, inexperienced and generally not working to their usual standards---and I do appreciate his nice message.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eYzNsTc9BXKIPP7FXx5kjg"}
