(instant shock #1) i explained to him what the garage back home had told me about my brake pads being low, and he was like 'mamn, they are definitely not low. i don't know why they told you that. they look great. all you need is your rear brakes adjusted, and that's just $40'. derwin made my day. he explained everything so well, i could totally understand him. he took me for a test drive before and after, and oh my goodness my baby was running perfect! derwin saved me at least $160, and was completely honest with me. he could have easily told me i needed a whole new braking system for $3240589 and i would have believed him. i definitely recommend this business, you will not be disappointed. this is my new car maintenance spot.", "business_id": "thQXahqiBwd_SQQepvMNIA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}
