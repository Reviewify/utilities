I'm a student at Georgia Tech, and I went home for winter break. While I was home, I got my 4Runner looked at by some other garage to make sure everything was looking good. That garage told me my front brake pads were so low, I shouldn't ride on them for more than another month. Well, I shrugged it off and said I had to think about it. Lets just say 3 months pass and I am back in Atlanta, and that entire 3 months if anything went wrong with my 4Runner, my first thought was because I had bad brakes. I finally decided to get my brakes worked on, and I had heard good reviews about Meineke on Hemphill (really close to Tech!). I sulked in there, expecting the hear the worse along with a huge price tag. Derwin explained to me that I had at least 60% of my brake pads left. (Instant shock #1) I explained to him what the garage back home had told me about my brake pads being low, and he was like 'Mamn, they are definitely not low. I don't know why they told you that. They look great. All you need is your rear brakes adjusted, and that's just $40'. Derwin made my day. He explained everything so well, I could totally understand him. He took me for a test drive before and after, and OH MY GOODNESS my baby was running PERFECT!  Derwin saved me at least $160, and was completely honest with me. He could have easily told me i needed a whole new braking system for $3240589 and I would have believed him. I definitely recommend this business, you will not be disappointed. This is my new car maintenance spot.", "business_id": "thQXahqiBwd_SQQepvMNIA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-08", "type": "review"}
