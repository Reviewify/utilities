She seems very receptive to clients needs. Don't be fooded by the name though, this is no Bed Bath & Beyond this is a high end cooking store that also offers a array of cooking and skills classes. I think they have been in operation less then a year and a half and I know they have been swamped with requests to classes and new merchandise. If your looking for something high end or unique for yourself or a gift I would give this place a look.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sY78l10spysPY4vpT9qqsg"}
