The restaurant is somewhat darkly lit in the evening, so it's nice for romantic evening.  Elegantly decorated dining room alongside some interesting art on the walls.   Our waitress was very nice.   Just checked the current menu, so what I explain next may not be on the menu now.  We received a complimentary and delicious amuse bouche of soup that was good.   We had our appetizers, mine was the foie gras, and his was an Indian themed appetizer.   Foie gras was excellent.  Tried his but I liked mine better.  I got the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly, and the vegetables were delicious.  Don't remember what my husband got as an entree because I was so fixated on mine.  I also got a sampler of wines, but I'm not sure if they still do that any more.  Haven't been back, because for us it's a special occasion restaurant and also we now live 700 miles away.   If we ever visit the Chapel hill area, it would be on the top of the list for restaurants to go to.", "business_id": "sY_8iE6vA3mjcrpIKPKwGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-18", "type": "review"}
