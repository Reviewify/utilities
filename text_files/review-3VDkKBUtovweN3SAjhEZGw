First thing I want to go after 3 hours of impossible statistics problems? Gobble up sushi. So we went to Thelonious Monkfish after I had heard through the grapevine how good it was; after endless debate, we ordered the Scorpion Roll (Grilled eel, avocado & tobiko, wrapped in shrimp) and The Snow Queen Roll (Shiitake, apple, cukes & asparagus wrapped in seaweed & rice, draped w/ young coconut meat, drizzled with pineapple mayo, garnished with coconut glakes). For creativity, the menu gets a 10 out of five. Out of all the sushi restaurants I have been to, I have not yet seen anything this creative, in name or in components. Overall thought: the maki was really good , and I would definitely come back...alas the four stars. And now on to criticisms: For the scorpion avocado eel ratio was so wrong not even partial credit is given. As a friend mentioned, the sweetness of the barbeque sauce just melts into the overwhelming avocado. In fact, I was eating sweetened avocado with a slight crunch of the tobiko with shrimp that was a little too tough on the teeth. And the fairy tale roll? A little too sweet. I was looking for a main meal here, not dessert sushi. But if there's a thing as dessert sushi, Thelonious Monkfish has got it down. Besides, the young coconut meat was fresh and simply lovely. The service is quick and friendly. Just the way I like it. Five stars there.", "business_id": "H_XBx4erPI4IrUo8WySPLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-10", "type": "review"}
