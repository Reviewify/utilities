I have always been satisfied with my piercings from there.  If the owner is who I think it is, he is a totally cool guy.  He always talks to me when I go in and treats me really nicely.  Tim has done the majority of my piercings... I think Carrie (I think that's her name... it's been a long time.) has done one or two.  The reason I give this only 3 stars, and I feel generous doing so, is because the last piercing I got, my tongue,  actually was pierced fairly crooked.  When I went to get my jewelry swapped after the swelling went down, I got attitude from the piercer, saying \"this is so crooked, who did this?!\" (not in a nice way)... i had no choice than to say \"DUDE YOU DID!\"  I dont mind that it's a little crooked because you cant tell unless you look at the bottom of my tongue, and who the hell looks there?  ALSO... another reason for the 3 stars is because I went there to get a tattoo, stood there for a good 15 minutes before I was even addressed (no they weren't particularly busy) and was greeted by some guy who was a total JERK.  Right then and there I vowed to never get a tattoo done at Zebra's.    So between the tattoo encounter and my last piercing, I have been put off a bit when it comes to Zebra's.  I'm willing to give it another shot, but they're on thin ice with me.", "business_id": "CVpKlqrjYCyjxnlkBCUK5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-21", "type": "review"}
