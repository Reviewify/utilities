Regents Pizzeria does fo sho! This place has pretty good pizza but man there's just too much cheese up'n hea! I left this place with chronic lactose intolerance. I must say the veggie pizza was really good the next day. The portions are generous and the prices are average. The young girl at the counter treats you like you're the last person she want to deal with or maybe I just came when it was the time of the month? I guess she can't wait to get off cause she constantly checked her phone. The guys in the kitchen made up for good service because they were on a roll and were friendly and courteous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XqKhC29UQ1ya1Py3bTzvAA"}
