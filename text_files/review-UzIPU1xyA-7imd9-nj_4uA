Hands down. I will argue with anyone who claims otherwise . . . or ask for the address ;-).  \n\nBring your own wine (and a corkscrew just in case that day had seen a lot of sticky-fingered patrons). \n\nPerfect late lunch (to avoid the crowd) would be pizza and wine at Antico followed by desserts and coffee at Star Provisions just up the street. \n\nUmm, would have given it 5 stars if the staff at the register weren't ALWAYS so rude. I've been maybe 6 or 7 times and have never had a pleasant interaction with them. Maybe that's their thing (shrug).", "type": "review", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ"}
