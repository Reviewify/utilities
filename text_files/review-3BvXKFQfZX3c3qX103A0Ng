I went a few weeks ago with a girlfriend and we had a lovely evening, though in my wine induced haze, I don't think I realized how horrid (but friendly!) the service or mediocre the food was. Returned last night because I was craving shishito peppers...which make of it what you will -- but regardless, I remembered that they were good. Ummmm so the first 3 things came out almost immediately (peppers included) -- s/p ordering their veg summer rolls, I remembered that peppers, jicama, Bibb lettuce, and avo do not a summer roll make -- and the green papaya salad tasted like the lime had gone off. Rejection. We waited another hour for 4 more dishes, pretty much all of which shouldn't take more than 15 minutes total. An iced tea was forgotten. Our blackened fish roti had to be sent back because it tasted like vom. It was the type of meal where I didn't actually want to eat anything presented to me and left hungrier than when I arrived. We came home and ate second dinner here. Also, both times the hostess has been rude and whorish. We are in Central Square, not Manhattan, no need to a) dress like a prostitute, and b) judge me aggressively and act like it's a favor you're doing to seat me.  Din for 2 is around $50 -- I think that's abt 6 small plates? Really, not worth it.", "business_id": "jxTZafP6SAsFEZzNmjQqbQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-26", "type": "review"}
