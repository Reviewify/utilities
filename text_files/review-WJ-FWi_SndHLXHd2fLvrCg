Their paninis are really tasty and original. I love the combo of flavors they put in their food. They give you this cute little salad with the sando and it's based off of what is fresh at the market which is pretty neat. Wine selection is amaaazing. Also came here for a girls night out and split a bottle that was a mix of Granache, Syrah, and Sangiovese...can't remember the name of it though. It was delicious. I have tried 3 other red wines here, all very good. The wood floors were imported from italy or something. The girls that work there are informative and kind, and the wine lounge has a great mellow atmosphere. The dj was spinning some mellow beats and I there's nothing to complain about :) I def recommend this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DVuM5Lca3dIPoEMaD89Qjw"}
