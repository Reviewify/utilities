About 5 years ago the owners changed and the quality went downhill, but 6 months ago I noticed the owners had changed again and so I thought I'd give it another try. I am SO GLAD I did! Their batter mix can be a bit on the salty side sometimes but their friend fish is super crisp on the outside and has a nice succulent/savory bite to it. You can request steaks or fillets and now that the owners changed back to using fresh fish and home made fries the quality can't be beat. I also highly recommend their shrimp. As for sides, try their hush puppies... they're to die for. Also, you also might want to try the macaroni salad. I'm usually not a fan of savory/sweet foods but it's nice and light, cooling on the toungue, and has surprise pockets of crunchy goodness with finely diced celery pieces. It's the perfect contrast for the warm salty fish. If you're not a fan of sweet, try the potato salad. It's salty and tangy and very thick. Think almost like mashed potato salad. MMMM... writing this makes me crave Royal Fish.....", "business_id": "QfhRDOa1IIihaajPvJrHfg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-04", "type": "review"}
