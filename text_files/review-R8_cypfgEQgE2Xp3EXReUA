When it first opened, they offered their best in terms of service. Now, you'll never see the same employees twice. They hire these random people and it confuses me because I just feel like they know nothing about the food. Just how to scoop and drop. They keep the pre-made naan in one of those coolers that you put water in, so the naan is a bit rubbery since it's been sitting around and isn't fresh. The food isn't fresh anymore and it just sits there for hours since the place isn't too busy. They used to say, \"oh we're cheaper than Chipotle.\" No way. They are more expensive and the service isn't as good as it used to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UzygjQQQpbp2OxjCVxjP0A"}
