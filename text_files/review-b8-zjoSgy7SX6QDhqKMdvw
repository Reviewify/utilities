I've never found another shop that gives a 20% subscriber discount and doesn't require a minimum number of books to get a pull list.  And it's open pretty late, which means it's perfect to go get your comics, grab a hot chocolate at Burdicks and then go out in Cambridge. That's the way I roll.\n\nIt's small and has a pretty limited selection of back issues on the shelf, but they're very welcoming to women which is still something unusual for a comic book shop and a bunch of the workers give great recommendations.  There's another comic book shop in the same area but they close so early I've never gone. When I make it back up to Boston I'll definitely go back to visit and curse how much I hate my new comic book shop in comparison.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JE8715ehKeQKVlCd_tBTeg"}
