As a landlord, I have worked with him twice in two years and each time he has brought multiple people through to view the property.\n\n In doing so, he's been respectful of the tenants living there; has found quality new tenants each time; does thorough background checks and is conscientious about putting together and explaining our lease to incoming tenants so that everyone understands their obligations. \n\nBest of all, he knows how to prices properties and better still, how to get asking price or more!  We had a bidding war!   Our place went on MLS on Wed and by Sat a lease was signed...\n\nTom's a good guy who works honestly and hard and earns his fee. I will list exclusively with him again and recommend to anyone that they do that same. \n\nThanks Tom!,", "type": "review", "business_id": "QdXXDcGIv3cCeFvHrVmuug"}
