I am going to preface the next paragraph with this: I do NOT have OCD tendencies. I do not carry around anti-bacterial hand wash unless I am in third world countries because in general a little bit of dirt doesn't really bother me. So, I've been here a few times, both upstairs and downstairs and it just strikes me as grimy. They don't set the lights low enough to hide that fact and so I really just never want to touch anything. Given that, I've never had the desire to eat food here either. I did go with a friend once who ordered a cheeseburger and fries and although I didn't eat any of his food, I'd say I wasn't really impressed. I definitely think if you were looking for a burger McDonalds would be tastier. Conclusion: it just isn't my type of dive.", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}
