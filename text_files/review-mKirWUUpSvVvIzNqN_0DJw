We both got coffee and bagels. It was so cute how he meticulously poured and then stirred his cream and sugar.  So it holds a big place in my heart.  We also got coffee here right before he proposed to me at Atlantic & Ferst (the trolley even came by and it was annoying to have people clapping and screaming Say Yes!) Back to the actual cafe...The girls that work this place are nice, the iced coffee is the best (frozen cubes of coffee instead of ice = crack to me), and being next to the Chem annex didn't hurt either. Batdorf and Bronson are the beans used and you can taste the difference. They are my other favorite spot besides Coffee Snobs.", "business_id": "yfRTRjDyOH2BW9QkMQ1Cdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-23", "type": "review"}
