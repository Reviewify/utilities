Also, the ambiance feels more Bavarian because the seating is by long wooden tables, with smaller tables on the terrace.\n\nSince I'm eat only fish or vegetarian, there was not much in terms of food selection (which is full of wurst this and wurst that), but the guacamole and chips that other diners were having seemed quite tasty.\n\nLots of interesting beer options - I've only tried the Erdinger, which is delicious!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fk495HaokZDrGkAG8s_dlg"}
