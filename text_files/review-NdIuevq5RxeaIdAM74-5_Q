It carries a variety of items in addition to clothing, such as candles, perfumes, household accessories (pillows, doorknobs, etc), and paper products. It definitely provides an alternative to Banana Republic and Ann Taylor's practical solid colored tops and bottoms.  I agree that it's somewhat overpriced for hippie looking stuff.  But the colorful patterns are fun looking and easily paired with the solid stuff you get from Banana Republic.  I'd browse through the sale rack.  The return policy is quite lenient, so if buyer's remorse hits you really hard, you can always take it back to the store.  Happy Shopping!", "business_id": "AB2EgekwtXiXfzi8_FL30w", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-02-11", "type": "review"}
