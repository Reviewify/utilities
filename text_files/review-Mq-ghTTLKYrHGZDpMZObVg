The burgers are made well and they're good with their respective toppings. I've had the LA burger and original burger and I certainly enjoyed it but it hasn't rocked my boat all too much. The meat is juicy and tender and made to what you want it to be. I love the crunchified option but I can't always justify adding 25 cents worth of potato chips for and extra dollar. Their toppings are also good quality and certainly add to the wonderful burger. However, I have to say the highlight of this place is actually their sweet potato fries with the mustard sauce they serve it in. OMG, so good. I also love their milkshakes too. Wow, creamy and decadent just like I like it. I have tried their chocolate milkshake and their black and white and both are actually quite good. Did I mention they also have spiked milkshakes? This will certainly be my next adventure at this place. However, for the area it's in, this burger place will probably be your best bet!", "type": "review", "business_id": "csS_UrBujOvjASbX3gLW7w"}
