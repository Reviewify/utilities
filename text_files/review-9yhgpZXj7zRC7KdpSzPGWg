However, it has large enough selection that I prefer it to many other Chinese restaurants in the area (there are lots!). Don't order what you know- branch out here, it's worth it. \n\nI would note their menu has an unspoken distinction between the Westernized and more authentic items, which is easy to find- simply note there are two chicken sections and the Westernized contains the familiar items like Kung Pao and Sesame. Try the other section. \n\nWhat keeps me coming back is the Taiwanese Salt and Pepper chicken I randomly ordered off the \"authentic\" section of the menu. It's crispy pieces of peppery chicken fried in ginger. It's wonderful and unlike anything I've ever had. \n\nThe atmosphere is nothing special and the tea isn't as good as Mandarin Wok's, but the menu makes it worth it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jKxES7iLV63H_PfyGVGIDw"}
