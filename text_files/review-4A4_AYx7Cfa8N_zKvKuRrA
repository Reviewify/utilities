Scoop's specializes in ice cream toppings; they must have at least 30 or 40, ranging from Oreo's to coconut slivers, ready and available each day, which in itself is unique. Another unique thing about Scoop DeVille is that they blend their ice cream so that the toppings are mixed in. The end result is like a very thick milkshake with toppings mixed in. \n\nI wasn't crazy about it when I tried it, but it definitely was an interesting experience and a unique flavor. I would definitely recommend this little shop whenever you are in need of a little variation from your traditional ice cream parlor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vnMkIv4KNMUoXwtb4ljezA"}
