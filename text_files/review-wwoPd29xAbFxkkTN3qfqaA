Now, substitute prostitution with decadent cocktails and a delicious international tapas menu. That, my friends, is Cuchi Cuchi. I went with my family to celebrate my birthday and it was the perfect choice for a special occasion- festive, trendy and exotic. I savored several of their cocktails (my favorite was one with muddled raspberries, Citron and a hint of ginger-) and their white sangria. I don't eat meat so the majority of our dishes were just vegetables and fish. My favorites were the Fried Artichoke Hearts, Mushroom Risotto and Sizzling Garlic Shrimp. My dad did remark that it was a restaurant geared towards women but he still enjoyed himself. It's my new favorite Cambridge restaurant!", "business_id": "C7FKNwSUlbUinT9cRSLXHA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-04-18", "type": "review"}
