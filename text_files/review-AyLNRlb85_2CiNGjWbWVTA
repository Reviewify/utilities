When we got there the bar was packed, so we struggled to find someone to help us find a place to sit. The hostess seemed a little frazzled, but ended up opening a dining room next to the bar. We sat for a while (without drinks) and finally grabbed her again to find out if we should order at the bar - she said no because it was so packed. As far as we could tell there was only one server for the rest of the place and there were many other people showing up. He seemed like he was trying, but we certainly went for longer than we would like without drinks. Had the service been better, the place would have been good. Their happy hour menu seemed pretty good - really cheap sliders and a few other options. Mine was tasty - though soggy, likely from the server not picking it up for 20 minutes. I had a sangria that was tasty, but the spiked lemonade was terrible. The beer selection was reasonable, but the server did not seem very knowledgeable about it.", "business_id": "jNumpugSUbF_XraDG2eQNA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-29", "type": "review"}
