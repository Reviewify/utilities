I've eaten here a handful of times - it's kinda fun establishing a joint called, \"Noodle Planet\" -- I mean c'mon: NOODLE PLANET! I'd come here during the L.A. Film Festival (when it was hosted in Westwood) in between screenings. This was a perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat. Service is fast... the portions are HUGE! And to top it off, the prices are cheap - nice! With such a fast turnaround of diners, I do question the cleanliness of the tables, seats, etc.... nobody likes to sit on a dried up noodle. It's a CASH only restaurant... which is good b/c it keeps the prices down, There are plenty of ATM's around. Don't know if you necessarily wanna bring your date here for dinner, but... for a sit down place with friends, semi-authentic Asian cuisine, fast dining, this is a pretty good choice.", "business_id": "P_7A5Ztw4Pwizpdqfx-G-Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-19", "type": "review"}
