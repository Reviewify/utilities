Film Festival (when it was hosted in Westwood) in between screenings. This was a perfect place to grab a quick bite to eat. Service is fast... the portions are HUGE! And to top it off, the prices are cheap - nice!\n\nWith such a fast turnaround of diners, I do question the cleanliness of the tables, seats, etc.... nobody likes to sit on a dried up noodle.\n\nIt's a CASH only restaurant... which is good b/c it keeps the prices down, There are plenty of ATM's around.\n\nDon't know if you necessarily wanna bring your date here for dinner, but... for a sit down place with friends, semi-authentic Asian cuisine, fast dining, this is a pretty good choice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P_7A5Ztw4Pwizpdqfx-G-Q"}
