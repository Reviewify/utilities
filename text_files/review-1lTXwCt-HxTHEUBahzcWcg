My cheeks hurt from all the laughing and smiling! Every character was fabulous and the whole show was flawless! The food is delicious and the selection is great. I've been to this place three times and each time it is a wonderful experience! The servers are wonderful and the shows never fall short of wonderful. See a show, have dinner and come away with great memories!", "business_id": "YuRAhKAykFl6HE_nw3fYZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-01", "type": "review"}
