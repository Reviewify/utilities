Went back last night, and the romance is officially over. So, the restaurant is mostly-empty, but we're seated at a tiny table in the middle. Two different servers think they're serving our table, which speaks to the service issues other people have written about. Our drinks were WEAK, and the food was eh. In fact, we ordered the paneer, avocado, and jalapeno roti, and it was served to us with no avocado. We ask the server and she goes to inquire, and it turns out that they're out of avocado. No offer to take it off the check (though to be honest I forgot to look closely at the check, so they might have...), no offer to replace it, but our server (sweetly, but still) said, \"You guys seemed cool, so hopefully it's not a problem.\" Actually, we're polite. And it IS a problem when you're missing an ingredient and just serve us something different instead. Meanwhile, the jalapeno was just sliced on top,not incorporated into the food, and one bite burned my lips pretty badly so I had to remove it from the plate. The pork dumplings were underseasoned, and the noodle portions are too small. Plus, we met up with some friends there later, and despite the fact that I was planning to have a few more drinks (you know, because the first two I had lacked alcohol), except for the fact that we were COMPLETELY ignored by the server. You know, empty restaurant, table of seven happy to buy drinks... obviously we should be ignored. I'm actually pissed off that I spent money there last night, and cannot BELIEVE how sharply my opinion of this place changed.", "business_id": "jxTZafP6SAsFEZzNmjQqbQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}
