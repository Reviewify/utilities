I was here a long time ago, but was in L.A. with friends yesterday and had their ice cream sandwich. CHEAP and DELICIOUS!! $1.50 for a cookie sandwich with your choice of any 2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream! YUM! \n\nAlso, go 1/2 a down cookies to go which was super cheap. I know it was $.35 per cookie, but if you buy 1/2 a dozen, it was like $2.00. So freakin worth it. \n\nOk..bad place for a diet, but in moderation, right? Thanks goodness I live kinda far from this place or is that a bad thing? I don't know. Go get your sugar rush here..=)", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
