They really do strive to make you feel important and well taken care of.  I have only been to this place twice, once for breakfast and second time for coffee. On my first visit, I thought the menu was a bit small.  My sister mentioned that they only recently reduced it.  Breakfast was really good, but what stood out the most was the coffee and bread. I would go again, but breakfast is a little bit pricey.  Then again, it is really good too.  So I guess it depends on how much you want to splurge.", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-11", "type": "review"}
