They really do strive to make you feel important and well taken care of.  I have only been to this place twice, once for breakfast and second time for coffee.\n\nOn my first visit, I thought the menu was a bit small.  My sister mentioned that they only recently reduced it.  Breakfast was really good, but what stood out the most was the coffee and bread.\n\nI would go again, but breakfast is a little bit pricey.  Then again, it is really good too.  So I guess it depends on how much you want to splurge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw"}
