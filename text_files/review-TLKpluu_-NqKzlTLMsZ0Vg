If you want to enjoy the weather, this is a good place to hang. Our waitress was great and knew just what to suggest.  The queso was surprisingly delicious. It definitely was a kick up from the normal velveeta/rotel norm that I've come to expect from most \"tex mex\" spots. I will order it again, for sure. The ahi tuna tacos are some of the best I've had in a while and believe me, I'm a taco connoisseur. Promise you won't be disappointed unless you're scared of undercooked meat.  A friend got the breakfast burger and I cant name any complaints with that either. Beef, egg and salsa, what more can you ask for? It woud be too heavy for actual breakfast but perfect for 2pm first meal. Definitely a nice switch up when you've had breakfast tacos every morning for the past two weeks, which tends to happen when you live in ATX and have SO many good options.  I don't give two shits about football but they play all the big games here so if youre a dude wanting to hang with a girl who has got taste while simultaneously enjoying your favorite rivalry then this is a good place to be.", "business_id": "TUWrwm9iOsbEzyo6s4IdFA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-23", "type": "review"}
