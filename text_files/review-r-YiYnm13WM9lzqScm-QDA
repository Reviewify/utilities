I don't like their prices ($1.50 for a fountain soda and $1 refills; sandwiches for $7) for the quality. The sandwiches have good flavor but aren't particularly tasty or substantial. I heard from a friend that the nutella croissant that is grilled and served warm is amazing but again, for nearly $4, I'll pass.\n\nIt's too bad the trucks are gone. :(", "type": "review", "business_id": "4FnRjCWmf0IS_oX3CQ80ng"}
