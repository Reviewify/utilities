I was in the Mediterranean last year.  This was my first trip to SLO, and after checking Yelp, I hopped in my car and went straight here.\n\nI had the chicken shawarma and falafel, thinking I'd eat maybe half of each - I just really wanted to try both.  Um, yeah, ate it all.  The whole pita and 4 pieces of falafel.  I got up twice to physically walk away, and I couldn't stop eating it!  Mmmmmmm.\n\nThe chicken was great, although I'll say that I liked the crusty outside pieces better... it seemed like every bite had a little bit different flavor.  And I've NEVER had pita that delicious.  Ohitwassogood.\n\nI liked both the brown and red sauce... didn't think the brown was all that spicy, but really interesting.  red was just HOT!\n\nThe hummus was perfect.  The falafel was good - I don't say it was the best ever, but it satisfied my craving.  For a while.  I ate a LOT of Jaffa food tonight.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVvJdMA7xdllVEEeXjngjw"}
