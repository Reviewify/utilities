Warm lighting, exposed brick walls and a modern hint greeted me from the bleak winter night. When I wasn't talking or listening, I was just trying to take in the world around me.\n\nSecond, the food. It not only tasted great, but was so pretty I almost didn't want to eat it. Key word being ALMOST. Here is what I devoured.\n\n     First Course: prosciutto & Parmesan dumplings. Best dumplings I've ever had! \n     Second Course: tandoori roasted Amish chicken. Which actually came with vegetable biryani, cashew basmati, papadum, and apricot- tamarind chutney as well.\n     Third Course: bougatsa/ semolina custard in crispy phyllo, coffee pot de cr\u00e8me, metaxa caramel. The Coffee pot de creme and phyllo didn't taste great by themselves, but putting it together was a killer combination.\n\nThird, the service. Already mentally and sensorially damaged by indulgence, I could not comprehend the three different waiters we had who swiftly filled glasses, brought more food and asks how our experience was going.\n\nMy experience is still continuing as I digest and post this review. Vinology, you are wonderful and look forward to my next visit", "type": "review", "business_id": "qkw4xWWgTufvBs1NcxsFnw"}
