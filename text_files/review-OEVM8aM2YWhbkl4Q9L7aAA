There was a small line outside, but it moved fairly quickly. Sweet!\n\nI got 2 chocolate chip cookies with peanut butter cup ice cream.\nIt was good.. but I guess I felt a bit underwhelmed.\nThe ice cream was very tasty, but the cookies were a bit bland I thought. Bland, and on the hard side. They didn't seem fresh, which I thought was a bit odd, seeing as how I could see the workers stacking fresh cookies on top of each other in the window. Strange.\n\nThe prices are the best thing about this place.\n\nParking is a royal pain, and I wish that Diddy took ATM cards. I never carry cash on me anymore.\n\nI'd go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
