Went here on a weeknight to fill my ice cream sandwich craving. There was a small line outside, but it moved fairly quickly. Sweet! I got 2 chocolate chip cookies with peanut butter cup ice cream. It was good.. but I guess I felt a bit underwhelmed. The ice cream was very tasty, but the cookies were a bit bland I thought. Bland, and on the hard side. They didn't seem fresh, which I thought was a bit odd, seeing as how I could see the workers stacking fresh cookies on top of each other in the window. Strange. The prices are the best thing about this place. Parking is a royal pain, and I wish that Diddy took ATM cards. I never carry cash on me anymore. I'd go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-18", "type": "review"}
