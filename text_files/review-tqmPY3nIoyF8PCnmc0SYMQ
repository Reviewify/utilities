Their eggplant parmesan, lasagne, and green salad from their catering menu is divine. \nThe breakfast sandwich is perfection. A better than fresh ciabatta roll, pecorino cheese, a perfectly cooked egg, and prosciutto. Heaven, best I've eaten anywhere. Omelets are light fluffy and perfectly seasoned from the catering menu.\nAny of the sandwich specials will send you in to orbit.\nServed with the side of fresh house made chips with sea salt and a hit of crisped oregano leaves, they are the perfect foil for the sandwiches. Best bread I've had since Paris.\nThe coffee at Tootsies makes Starbucks and Peets taste like Denny's coffee from the bottom of the pot at 3am... Don't miss this gem.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3XwVZr6Jj2DnZ8B2W3RboQ"}
