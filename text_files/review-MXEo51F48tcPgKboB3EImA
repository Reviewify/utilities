It attracts a variety of people, from hippie musicians (who play their guitar inside) to the more conservative crowd. The interior architecture is unique and the decor is beautiful and reflective of the cafe's pan-Arabian origins.  I ordered the Iced Cafe Viennese with a fruit salad. My friends were more daring and tried Pecan Pie, Baklava, and Hibiscus tea. All loved their deserts, however the tea was not what my friend was expecting. There are many choices on the menu, aside from desert. I saw someone eating crepes, and another eating a sandwich. They also serve beer and wine.  I definitely recommend checking this place out. The space can be a bit cramped, so don't bring a large crowd with you.", "business_id": "GPhnm_rcjkbc_b96DVS5HQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-15", "type": "review"}
