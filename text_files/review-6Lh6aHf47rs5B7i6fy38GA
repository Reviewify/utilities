Not only ample (about 6-8 oz.), and cooked to perfection, but local grass feed and delicious.  The thing that was really unique about it is the cattle are fed the spent brewery grains that the beer is made from and it gives it a wonderful flavor.  It honesty seemed to have a bit of a beer scent and there was a sweetness to the meat.  It really was fantastic!  I got the sweet potato fries with it that couldn't have been fried more perfectly.  Crisp on the outside and tasty on the inside.\n\nThere's a good variety on the menu, but not so many choices that you get overwhelmed and have a heck of a time deciding what to order.  Even still, a lot appealed to us and it took a bit to decide what to get.  They have weekly lunch specials and a special seasonal section, which is nice too.\n\nWe went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was very laid back with a smattering of people dining.  Our waitress was terrific and made sure we got what we needed when we needed it.  She liked to joke around quite a bit so that added some fun to it for us. \n\nI'm so glad I purchased two of these deals, but even if I hadn't I know we'd be back again - and soon!!  Needless to say, I highly recommend dining here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "He5L40pVWlrB1wrgx7LrAg"}
