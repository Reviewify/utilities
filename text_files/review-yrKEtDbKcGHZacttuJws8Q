Comfortable, if you're a fan of heavenly, pillow-top mattresses... not so much when you're used to sleeping on a memory foam mattress. If you're a smoker... ask for room 305. It's at the end of the hallway, which is bad for you lazies out there. but there is a \"private\" patio that's about 1/2 the size of the room.\n\nA bit disappointed that rooms were equipped with ~27inch tube TVs. And also annoyed that the TV automatically resets itself to FULL volume (as in, 67 out of 67) whenever you turn it off/on.\n\nBathrooms are decent, but I was met with lukewarm/borderline cold water early one evening after I went for a quick run at the gym... speaking of the gym.\n\nGym: on the 2nd floor, with stairs down to 1st floor indoor pool (tiny... but do-able). They had: 4 (or 5) treadmills all equipped with personal TVs, a couple step climbers, a couple bikes, and an elliptical (that didn't work). One multi-gym apparatus, and dumbbells up to 50lb.. which I guess is heavy enough for most corporate-types (i kid... kind of).\n\nRuling: Adequate I suppose.\n\nConference Rooms/Catering: No problems that I was aware of.\nParking: Plenty of outdoor (free) self-parking.\n\"Lobby\" Bar: ummm... the bathroom counters are larger than the bar counter.\n\nService: Pretty excellent I must say. The staff knew a lot of the \"regular\" guests by name. They have a free shuttle that we'll take you to local places around Princeton (I believe they'll even pick you up to).\n\nIf this wasn't a \"Westin\", I would give it 4-5 stars... but being one of the \"premier\" Starwood Hotel Names, I have to say there is a bit of room for improvement.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oVse63-Kc1elHM9pqaaacQ"}
