The prices seem about the same with each other, but I can see that Pho Than was just packed with people while this place was mostly empty. The food was pretty was pretty good and filling with what we ordered. My gf had a regular pho and I had ordered my usual grilled pork over rice. It was tasty with the extra sauce you pour on top of the pork and with a nice fresh side salad even. The meal also includes a free cream puff for each entree you order! I have to say that I did like coming here maybe because it wasn't busy and crowded, but also that it was a good place for a quick and cheap lunch.", "business_id": "AUz4akyLb32J7SDa_nKgMQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-03", "type": "review"}
