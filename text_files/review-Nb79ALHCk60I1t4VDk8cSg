The staff here is phenomenal.  Evan, the owner and master chef, could not be more accommodating.  The waiters/waitresses and bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, and ready and willing to make your experience special.   What stands out about RHI is the fact that you can go there for a special occasion meal, or you can drop in for afternoon drinks and appetizers.  Either way, you'll have a good time.  The beer list is impressive, and offerings change pretty frequently, so you are never without new options.  Some menu items are staples while others change with the seasons.  The bar menu is tasty yet very affordable, making this a great happy hour location.  Definitely a place to try, and hopefully, a place you will return to soon after.", "business_id": "GJeDUUXbNjFbKR5DyCgF8A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-05", "type": "review"}
