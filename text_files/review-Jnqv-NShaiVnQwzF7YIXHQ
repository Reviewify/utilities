(i love to enjoy a large cold beer in the warm summer evening air). the food is fresh and tasteful: i love to start off with the calamari, and if i'm feeling ambitious, i'll have an item on their special's list -usually a fish dish. otherwise, i'll order a spinakopita (spinach pie) and a salad with a side of tzaziki and pita. notes: over the years i've noticed some little changes in the decor of the restaurant, but nothing drastic. the bathrooms were renovated a while back and it was a vast improvement to what it was. the menus have been converted to euros for the providence international traveler. prices are decent. overall 4 stars for above average, everything!", "business_id": "sIsXmah-sGpHaKBjU3KOFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}
