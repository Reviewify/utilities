And overall, have always had a pleasant experience. Service: I've always had prompt and friendly service. There's plenty of 2 and 4 tops, as well as group seating. In the summer, there is outdoor seating. (I love to enjoy a large cold beer in the warm summer evening air). The food is fresh and tasteful: I love to start off with the Calamari, and if I'm feeling ambitious, I'll have an item on their special's list -usually a fish dish. Otherwise, I'll order a spinakopita (spinach pie) and a salad with a side of tzaziki and pita. Notes:  Over the years I've noticed some little changes in the decor of the restaurant, but nothing drastic. The bathrooms were renovated a while back and it was a vast improvement to what it was. The menus have been converted to Euros for the Providence international traveler. Prices are decent. Overall 4 stars for above average, everything!", "business_id": "sIsXmah-sGpHaKBjU3KOFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-23", "type": "review"}
