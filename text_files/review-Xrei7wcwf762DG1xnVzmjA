It was seasoned well and had the garlic spread inside however they either put a little too much spread or too much humus inside and it did get to be a little much. I normally order their 1/4 plate of dark chicken but the last time I had it it was kinda fatty and slimy in places but it is normally great so I opted for something new today and I am glad I did. My biggest complaints are a) they put too much oil on top of the hummus that comes with the chicken plates and b) the pitas are always cold/hard. I love the chicken soo much I will back and those things are just small. Also the girls at the counter are not too friendly, and parking lot is sucky.", "business_id": "EMXF_jbhx_GNniMnG0uNVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-08", "type": "review"}
