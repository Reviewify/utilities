I was a loyal customer and bought plenty of things from this ULTA in La Jolla. Then I wanted to use my points and get a haircut. I said so when checked out and they made an appointment for me, but when I showed today for my haircut, I was told that I can't use my points at this time, they even accused me of \"assuming\". Then apologized and explained that they have many new employees.  Turned out, they are fully booked in December so it wasn't even possible to redeem points for services in the first place. So ladies, make sure you tell them twice about the points when you make an appointment. I don't feel like giving it a second try though.", "business_id": "JxiyJ7S_5juJbjLDUQ4dkA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-16", "type": "review"}
