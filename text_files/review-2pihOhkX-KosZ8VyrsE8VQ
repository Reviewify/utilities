Fantastic spot for people watch, great vibes, and beautiful, Mediterranean atmosphere. Loved this place when I was a student at Cal, and still love it now that I'm no longer one. My anthropology department is just right across the street, Telegraph Ave a couple of blocks down and the I house is just a couple of blocks up the hill. \n\nCome to this lovely cafe even if you're alone. Walk around the campus, meditate at the Faculty Glade and then stroll to Cafe Strada. Bring a book, order a cup of coffee, find a shaded outdoor spot, and really, just relax and chill.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ"}
