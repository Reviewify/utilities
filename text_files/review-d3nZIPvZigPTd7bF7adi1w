However, I always came out being disappointed. The girls cut my hair were very nice. They can carry conversations well. However, I feel that I can get better haircuts from some cheap chain haircut places. I expect a lot more for the price I paid there. I probably won't return again since I have tried three different stylists. Also, I think there are so many good reviews for this place is because they give discount for anyone who writes reviews on yelp.", "business_id": "rLJp8JAWaE4Jx04hdJzEhQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-07", "type": "review"}
