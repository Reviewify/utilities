I never heard of it before, but it was good. Large Cheeseburger: 4/5 - The burger w/ 2 thin patties was generic, but good & extra greasy. Top Sirloin Sandwich: 4/5 - The sandwich consists of 4 thin sliced of top sirloin, grilled onions, jalapenos, & Swiss cheese in a toasted hoagie. It's also extra greasy. Homemade Onion Rings: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 - I was greeted by 3 different employees when I came in. You can't ask for much more for a diner style restaurant.
