My drink (Rosemaya) as described looked right up my alley-Hendricks, cucumber. But it was basically green simple syrup. I drink ANYTHING short of listerine and rubbing alcohol but I could not stomach this. It became a communal table drink and it still did not get finished (there were 12 of us). My meal was so bland yet there was no s&p on the table. None of my pals liked their food either-it made the evening sort of awkward.  Then came the desserts-we ordered four different and they were all disgusting.  When have you seen a table of 12 gals not finish even one dessert?  In summary, gross.", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-04-19", "type": "review"}
