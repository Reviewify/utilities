Definitely one of the more unique ways to have a wine tasting. \n\nThere seems to be some confusion with how their chipped \"smart\" cards work. As in whether they're preloaded with a certain amount of money (ie: D&B's) or whether you're charged the total at the end of the night. We we there recently, and from what I experienced, you leave your credit card with one of the Wine Detective staff and receive one of their chipped cards (not preloaded with any amount). It's used just to tally up what you've sucked up and it will be charged to your credit card at the end of the night. Now, let the wine tasting begin!\n\nHonestly, I don't know much about wines, but the Dr.Loosen Riesling (the sweetest one available) was excellent. The others that I tried out were just okay, but it was a fun experience nonetheless. Fortunately, the place wasn't too busy when we were there, so we got a nice table to sit at. Stacy brought out crackers and glasses of water to cleanse our palettes. Heehee. She was very helpful and so was everyone else there. :)\n\nThere is Espresso, Cappuccino and some tea available as well just in case you're not in the mood for too much wine or you got yourself a little too tipsy or sumthin.

There are some cheese plates and other food available, but no comment from me since we were already full from din din.\n\nIt's a great place to bring a date, probably post-dinner. (Ryan, I'm talking to yoooooo!). Well...I THINK it is anyway. What do I know about dating. Hmmph.  -__-", "type": "review", "business_id": "LV6R7n8c1aBSWhRz1fDDIQ"}
