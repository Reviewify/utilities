The clothes were extremely cheap. Yes, I understand that they only charge $4, but many outfits had stains or holes in them. The jewely was plastic and obnoxious. I wouldn't gift it to a four year old. Frankly, everything here you can find in Santee Alley for $1 each. It is worth the trip downtown. Don't waste your time on this place.", "business_id": "p-viS1wU1oL--7lTlbdeXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-08-09", "type": "review"}
