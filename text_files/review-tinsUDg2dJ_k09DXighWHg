Harvard is in the Harvard Square section of Cambridge, MA - a neighborhood with great restaurants, easy on ID bars, and plenty of ATMs. College life could not be more convenient. \n\nI had the pleasure of attending Harvard undergraduate school at the same time as Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. We had a few programming classes together, and we'd often eat in Kirkland Dining Hall together, excluded from the popular kid's tables. While you won't see in the Social Network movie, I actually helped Mark invent Facebook.  One day while stuffing our faces with fantastic Lobster Gnocchi made by the Harvard Dining Hall Chefs, I told Mark I was developing this new social networking site called BiSpace.  Mark thought it was a great idea, but he said I was thinking too small.  A few weeks later, Facebook was born.  Some people think I should sue for some royalties, but I'm a gentleman of Harvard so I adhere to a stricter code.  And anyway, I was able to make a small fortune off the sale of BiSpace.\n\nSo if you're looking for a great college experience, where you'll meet the future leaders of America while eating delicous food, Harvard is the place to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xU2VvqlGdTL-37GHc5R9iw"}
