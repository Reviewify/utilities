I don't know. Must've been tired or something. But i'm rating correct this time. Oh how I love living in soCAL because of your burgers. When someone tells me that they've \"found the best burger!\" If its not up to the standards of your burgers then I quicklly disagree and point them in the direction of the Back Abbey. From the meat to the bread to the salad, everything taste great. The fries and the dipping sauces are also very good. They have a wide selection of Belgium beers from Chimay to Delerium Tremens. You juist got to be on the look out for tables. There is no waitlist. If you see a party getting up be raedy to jump on that table. But it is worth the wait. TRUST ME! Waitors and Waitresses will take care of you over there. Before the Back Abbey my dad's favorite burger place was Islands. And after trying this place, Islands got pushed to #2.", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-17", "type": "review"}
