It wasn't overly busy, we were seated quickly and greated promptly.  My friend and I both asked for water to start and the server left to get it for us.... she was gone a VERY long time.  When she returned she had the two waters and told us about the specials.  She spoke very quietly and never looked at us... it was a bit uncomfortable for everyone I think.  We orderd the beer sampler which is a great deal.  $6 to try all their beers.  We ordered an appetizer too which was delicious.  A greek flat bread.  Yummy.  Next we had salad with pecans and it was also great.  When the server finally returned to collect our dirty plates and take a food order I chose the honey roasted pecan crusted salmon with dill sauce served with sweet jasmine rice and steamed vegetables.  The fish was very very very good.  The rice, not really my thing, however my friend enjoyed.  The steamed vegetables were good also.  My friend had the tuscan chicken pasta and it was etible. that is really all I can say about that.  Way too much garlic and otherwise flavorless.  When we finished dinner we flagged down our server .... finally... asked for a water refill and a desert menu.  She disappeared again and was gone for a very long time.  When she returned she just gave us our check..... no dessert menu.  Again, the place was not very busy, I don't think they were understaffed.   Three stars because my entree was very good.  The server was friendly and knowledgable but slow and unattentive. I will go back agin.  The salmon was too good to pass up.", "business_id": "rnu8-Nv0jZo5IIikJf0LUg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-22", "type": "review"}
