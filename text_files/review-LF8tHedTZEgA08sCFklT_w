Any restaurant should be able to accommodate an afternoon lunch.\n\nThere was a 15 minute wait for a table. My friend and I chose to wait in the bar area for about 10 minutes, while staring at an available empty table in the bar area. Eventually, the indifferent hostess came over and tried to seat us there. We opted to wait it out for a table, but I was annoyed that we were even forced to wait when there was a table available.  Shouldn't the hostess know how many empty seats there are available?\n\nService was quick and friendly. No complaints there. \n\nHowever, they were out of several things on the menu. That was actually a disappointment because I had to adjust my order. When the food arrived, it was lackluster and actually kind of bad. By burger was slightly overcooked and greasy with only about 4 caramelized onions, the fries were stiff, and my salad was underdressed.  \n\nMy friend got the steak tips, which were pretty much the worst tips we may have ever tried. The cut of the meat and the cooking was fine. However, they were drenched in poorly tasting barbecue sauce and saut\u00e9ed with red peppers and onions. The flavors of the sauce and peppers were overpowering and absolutely ruined the dish. The green beans were soggy and over salted. It came with a heaping side of bland stiff white rice. The whole dish was a disaster and especially unpalatable.  \n\nI can handle restaurants with lackluster service, but if the food is bad, there is little reason for me to return. We threw $50 at probably the worst lunch we have had outside of a fast food joint. Bummer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yoem-KW_Jln0LqsdLwLeUQ"}
