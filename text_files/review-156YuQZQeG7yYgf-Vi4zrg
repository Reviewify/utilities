Please do -- even if you aren't a health nut and you don't diet -- it will still shock you. I thought I was eating healthy -- some tasty soup or a grilled chicken sandwich. WRONG.  Plus, I used to go religiously every Monday for the Winter Garden Veggie soup, and then they discountinued it. I went three Mondays in a row and they said \"Oh, we're out.\" And then they finally told me they had discountinued it (without removing it from the menu).  On the plus side: They have a much better set-up than Au Bon Pain -- but try not to go between 12:00 and 12:30, it gets crazy.", "business_id": "kTtAWxP2kQroJdxJ_P1lhg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-15", "type": "review"}
