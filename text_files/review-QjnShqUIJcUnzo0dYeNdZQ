I had the empanadas (spicy beef and spinach & feta), they were quite good.  There are also at least 2 vegetarian dishes on special daily.  \n\nThey additionally have tonz of beautiful Peruvian art for sale here.  Not exactly the cheapest, but very fine craftmanship.  Definitely will be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw"}
