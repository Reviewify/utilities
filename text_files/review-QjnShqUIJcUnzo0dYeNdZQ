I had the empanadas (spicy beef and spinach & feta), they were quite good. There are also at least 2 vegetarian dishes on special daily. They additionally have tonz of beautiful Peruvian art for sale here. Not exactly the cheapest, but very fine craftmanship. Definitely will be back.", "business_id": "l6ZrDTwUHZebCG3C9Va3Dw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}
