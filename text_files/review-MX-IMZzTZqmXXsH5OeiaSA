Even as a little kid, I never thought the food at The Varsity was any good. I mean, I ate the food, but kids eat any kind of fast food. I think I most enjoyed the trip to the Varsity because I only went there a few times a year as a family, and since the place is a classic 1950's style drive-in restaurant, it was a unique experience. As an adult, I can say the Varsity is perhaps famous for being famous. Its a so called Atlanta tradition, and the tradition includes speaking about how good the food is at the place despite the truth. Its a basic fast food place, greasy burgers, fries, hotdogs, and shakes. It does not have a special taste... most street food I've had probably taste better. But it is the ambience. The place is always packed, and its right in downtown Atlanta. The establishment has been at the location forever and you get a sense of the retro feel there. Millions of Atlantans and visitors have stepped foot in this place to have a bite. You live or visit Atlanta, you pay tribute to The Varsity. As mentioned, I do not know what this is the case, its certainly not due to the food, but you just do it. Its tradition.", "business_id": "sPhPI3B6tvcJIULhICr-Pg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-24", "type": "review"}
