After reading other reviews, I was a little worried about the rude/pretentious baristas that a few people had mentioned, but that couldn't be further from the truth. As soon as I walked in, the barista greeted me and asked what I wanted. When I told her I had never been here before and wasn't very familiar with coffee, she picked up a menu and started going over it with me, pointing out the items she liked and that other customers liked. Overall, it was a very friendly environment and I felt very welcome there. I've also never had macarons before, but these were amazing! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to get a coffee, tea or just a little bit of dessert.", "business_id": "vONGfjuEYWtzvReseHJLrw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-28", "type": "review"}
