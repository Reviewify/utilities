I saw all the fantastic reviews and that this place has been in business for 30 years and knew it would be perfect.\n\nI ordered 4 pizzas and 2 orders of their breadsticks thinking with seven of us that should cover it.  Can I just say a week later we still have left overs?  And not because we didn't like the pizza but because when they say \"large\" they mean LARGE pizza.  I am used to chains where a large is barely enough to feed my two kids.  But ordering four of these let us try a nice variety to find out what IPIII is all about.\n\nMy favorite pizza has always been the Marguerite so I definitely wanted to try theirs.  I liked the sauce-very creamy, not straight tomato sauce but more substantial and the crust was also very buttery but I would have like slices of tomato rather than little pieces.  Basic was very good however.\n\nWe also got the stuffed meat pizza which I did not eat since I am veggie but my BIL had a love affair with this pizza eating 4 pieces of it and then 4 pieces for breakfast the next day.  \n\nWe also got the Sicilian crust cheese and cheese and pepperoni for the kids.  The cheese had very little cheese on it, mostly sauce so the kids weren't used to that but the pepperoni disappeared quickly.\n\nI have to say this is a great value too for very good pizza.  I would skip the chain and try this instead.  It's no wonder they have been around so long.  It is homemade and it shows.\n\nDelivery is through Tarheel Takeout and they were right on time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fhXHxDR59t7oQG8BjQEsFA"}
