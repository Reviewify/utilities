As such, you'd assume it to be representative of the culinary experiences available.  No, it's the snobby olive garden on the block.\n\nOnce I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich here.  I sent it back because it was a portobello MUSH-room sandwich.  The entire bottom half of the bun was a liquidy goo.\n\nI've also tried the gumbo, my husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  Both bland.  It's just not worth a $40 tab, especially knowing there are excellent restaurants up in northampton.\n\nThose experiences aside I have also gotten sick from eating here.  And it you read a sampling of the other reviews you'll realize this is a relatively common experience for Judie's diners.\n\nMost of the waitstaff is nice, but there have been the occasional bad apples.  And for those of you reviewers who say, \"you have to know what to order!\"  Hate to say it, but that's a bad sign if only the bread, salad and jam are good on an epically long menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FumYAtwmfAo1d0X3GouTHQ"}
