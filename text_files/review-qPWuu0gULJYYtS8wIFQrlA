Great service, great food, and their new booze menu is fabulous too. One other addition, their wine by the glass menu is lovely, not just your standard of one chard, one pinot, one cab... lots of variety.", "business_id": "A6p0E-nFupEjDKpKx45CIQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-08", "type": "review"}
