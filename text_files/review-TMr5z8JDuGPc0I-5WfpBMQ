Dinner for three was a  deal, thanks to a bit of budget sushi. I know that sounds wrong, but you know what I mean--the quality was great and most of the rolls we selected were 50% off, and the waiter was kind enough to point out when we had ordered two rolls and really only needed one. I had a two item bento box with some awesome Chinese style ribs. They taste exactly like those I get from Trader Joes, and with two items I was totally stuffed.", "business_id": "iQ3fajcAmbQrwPfg-AoJTA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-15", "type": "review"}
