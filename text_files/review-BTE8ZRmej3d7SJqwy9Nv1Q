I paid $7 for a veggie pizza bagel, and I asked for no mushrooms.  The bagel came with a thin layer of spinach and one tomato.  I went back to ask for more tomatoes, and they wanted to charge me 40 cents, after $7 for a measily bagel with cheese and a few veggies.  I won't ever order lunch from here again after seeing the scant toppings they put on their sandwiches!  I'd give it 1 star, but they get an extra star for a nice patio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yn_0NkOSp_hvaaJp-oK2kg"}
