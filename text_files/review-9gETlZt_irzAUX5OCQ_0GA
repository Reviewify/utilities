A long time ago I lost a screw for my cargo holder on the back of my bike. I went into Trophy and a kind bike mechanic immediately found a screw for me that he installed at no charge. It was a rainy day and I would have been in big trouble without that screw to hold my rack on the back of my bike for a 10 mile commute. My rack would have flew off with the right pothole for sure. I never forgot that experience and I went to Trophy a number of times afterwards. Recently, I purchased a Jamis Coda bicycle from Trophy, but I was frustrated it took quite awhile to receive it. I had to call them a few times to find out when my bike (I put a deposit 50% down) would actually have my bike in stock. I was told the economic downturn caused the shop to take a long time to get the bike, but I love it. I do not know how typical this is but Trophy had to order my Marathon tires and black Brooks saddle - they were not in stock. Nevertheless, the guys called me a few days later when they arrived and they installed them at no additional charge. Also, they helped me install my rear bicycle light (from my old bike) that I could not manage to do on my own. In fact, they donated to me a special piece of material that helps hold my light in place. I respect Trophy Bikes. I feel they are generous with advice and little tweaks light my bike light and long ago with the screw for my rear rack. I will use Trophy for years to come.", "business_id": "ysxrRklK6xqBiBznoFp7Cw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-04", "type": "review"}
