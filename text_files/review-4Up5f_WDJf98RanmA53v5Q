I went there today for lunch to try them out.  Took almost 40 minutes for my order of a 5 piece chicken to be ready for take out.  The place looked like a night club with its plush chairs and half empty liquor bottles strewn along the back wall.  It seemed like they were part way confused as to what type of establishment they wanted to be.  Their prices are near extortion for chicken.  5 pieces of chicken for 9 dollars plus tax.  So you're looking at around 2 dollars for a piece of KFC sized chicken. For the 5 pieces I got 2 thighs, 1 drumstick, 1 wing and half a breast piece.  Yep, they cut the breast portion in half because apparently it was too  big to just count as 1 piece.  Flavoring of the breading was poor.  White pepper and MSG were the main ingredients I could taste.  There may have been some salt in there too.  Didn't really add any depth of flavor just felt MSG filled.  The chicken itself had no seasoning and was pretty bland.  While it may have been fried in EVOO it certainly wasn't drained of it.  There was enough oil to soak through the take out box and stain everything yellow.  The chicken itself hadn't been sealed properly by the breading so it had pockets of oil lodged within.  So I got a mouthful of grease in every bite. Yum.  The pictures may look tasty on the site but I'm sure if I printed out the pictures and ate them that it would be more flavorful then the chicken I just ate.", "business_id": "8Mw2PtzFK1YioyzQE1wFxg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-02-20", "type": "review"}
