The coffee is good, the service is friendly, and there's a great selection of food whether you are looking for a snack, a meal, or something sweet.\n\nThe crepes and the omelets here are outstanding! Especially the vegetarian options. And all the pastries and baked-good I've had are delicious.\n\nThere are a few tables out front and a patio in the back if you want to sit outside. In the back, they have a couch and an armchair and a taller table that works well for small groups.\n\nThe only weird thing is that they don't bring cutlery out when you order the food so unless you think ahead, you have to walk back over to the counter. Not a big deal, but it would be a nice thing for them to do.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PTQVaWA-I5ZLzwy5oBbVMg"}
