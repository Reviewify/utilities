This place is great for the drinks only not the food. \n\nI ordered the Pomme Frites ($8) which I ended up finding out they are dipped in duck fat. Gross! I also got the Vegetable Burger ($11) which contained \"Grilled portabello mushroom, zucchini, red bell peppers & eggplant layered with feta cheese & herbed verde, served on a brioche bun\". The mushroom was really chewy and the burger wasn't so flavorful, didn't even finish it. \n\nAs for beers I ordered the Celebrator ($6), Scaldis ($8) and Fullers London Pride ($5)\n\n4 Stars for their great selection in Belgian beers. \n1 Star for the tasteless food and limited selection.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"}
