Never had a bad experience! Although once we ate outside and there was a bug crawling up the wall right next to us, but that's not any fault of theirs. The place is BYOB but it only applies to wine, you can't bring your own beer because they sell beer there. The food is always delicious, it's affordable, and very satisfying. You can order two pizzas, a pizza and a salad, or a pizza and a pasta for two and you will be stuffed. However, you definitely want to order pizza here, it's their signature item. It's really a great regular spot you can visit weekly. My favorite is the Cajun Shrimp pizza, it is healthier and I'm a big shrimp lover so this pie definitely hits the spot! The Peking Duck pizza is very interesting and something you probably won't get anywhere else. Overall, almost all the pizzas are very delectable and I wouldn't say I've had any one that really disappointed me.", "business_id": "tiCdi3sz6PlKc6MOPEWo7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-05", "type": "review"}
