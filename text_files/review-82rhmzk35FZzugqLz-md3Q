I'm sure after sharing 100oz of beer you think the food is awesome but if you're sober you'll find it's pretty mediocre and crappy. The nachos we had were soggy and covered in a mostly cold bland cheese sauce rather then melted cheese and don't bother paying the extra $1 for guac. The pulled pork sandwich was ok but it has the texture and tasted just like the pre-made Curly's brand you get at the grocery store and for $8 I could have bought a lot more of it at my local grocery store too. The fries were nothing special either. I couldn't help but feel like everything they served us was either pre-made/canned or frozen, nothing seemed fresh or made to order.", "business_id": "6fz6hlH9LDkZ9jwtwBVOEQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-27", "type": "review"}
