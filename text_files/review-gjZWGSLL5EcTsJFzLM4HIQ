I have gone twice and twice have had disaster. The first time we got the wrong food twice which I was willing to overlook because it was new and maybe they needed time to adjust and get things rolling. But when I got the bill and realized how expensive a burger was (REMEMBER they don't include fries) I was shocked. The second time, our food took a really, really, long time and the waiter was like \"wow I wonder what is going on in the kitchen.\" We literally almost got up and walked out but our food came at the last moment. I got the veggie burger which is small and average and I can't comment on the meat side. Suffice it to say, it is hyper-overpriced for a burger place and will probably go out business soon (I HOPE).", "business_id": "NRQbIOVnEnsJ8t2xg7W_zg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}
