We called ahead of time to confirm what time they close. The lady on the phone said they close at 10:30pm. When my wife and I entered at 10:00pm, NO ONE came to seat us! They were doing their own stuff as if we didn't exist. Strike ONE.\n\nSome waiter probably felt bad for us and painfully slowly seated us at a half cleaned table. Another 'head waitress' walked by and whispered to him \"kitchen is closed\" and walked off. He tried telling us that the kitchen was closed already. So we told him that we had called etc. He asked us to sit anyways. Strike TWO.\n\nFood was OK. Not as good as I thought. The Brie tarts and puff pastry chicken appetizers were fine but the salmon entree was substandard. Walked to the bathroom to wash my hands...and it saw the DIRTIEST dishwashing room and restroom ever. Strike THREE.\n\nWill never go back again...", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVYHX7RCPjCBqEth2CS91Q"}
