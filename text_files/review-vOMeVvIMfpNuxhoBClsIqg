It is more of a fresh/healthy ingredient place with an emphasis on vegetarian. I tried the grilled garden sandwich and it was decent. I'm always worried about not being full without eating some sort of meat item, but I wasn't hungry afterwards. My appetite was only at a moderate level on the day I visited this place. They don't offer complimentary tap water, so one either buys a beverage (including bottled water) or go without. I'd recommend the lemonade as I think they make it themselves. It was definitely not over-sweetened which was a refreshing change from heavily sweetened fountain drinks. I'll have to try one of their non-vegetarian items to see how they do on it.", "business_id": "bvrquYHSLWwlemJQJMaE7Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-02", "type": "review"}
