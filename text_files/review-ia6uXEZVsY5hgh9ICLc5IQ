I decided to give this place a try to get a simple bang trim, in hopes that if I liked it I could go back for a more serious cut. To my dismay, this will not be the place I return to for my cuts, or even simple trims. I had wispy, straight across bangs at the time with a few longer pieces on the edge to blend them out.  I asked that the stylist follow the same shape, but just shorten the bangs by about half an inch to keep them from getting in my eyes. Well, instead of following the shape, my stylist simple cut them straight across, chopping off all of the pieces that blended my bangs into my super long hair, and even went past the original bang line (a la Betsey Johnson's bangs), creating a thick bang that I did NOT come in with or ask for.  In addition the man that did my hair was extremely rude, he had me wait while took a break to smoke, which is also gross considering he then had to handle hair. I will never go back, which is unfortunate because after seeing the cute interior, the reasonable prices, and positive reviews, I would have thought they could at least succesfully execute a bang trim.", "business_id": "8SvhlxMYL4btB_zkQBtRAQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-24", "type": "review"}
