But then! I found the candy wall! They had bins of candy - chocolate covered gummy bears, chocolatey regular candy, and all the soury gummy candy I love. They also had fun dip, ring pops, candy necklaces, candy/gum/chocolate cigarettes, razzles, those big chewy sweet tarts, junior caramels (I have only ever seen the pints), pop rocks, and much more! \n\nThey also have all kinds of random toys like wind up plastic things that hop around (ears, frogs, etc), greeting cards, stuffed animals (big round fat cats and some weird animals that you don't usually see), balloons, streamers, gift bags, party favors, mad libs, candy shot glasses, different themed magnetic words and much more!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QND-tvk05oiQUIoL_5jJKw"}
