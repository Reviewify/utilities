The guy who helped us, Nathan, happens to have class with my boyfriend, and not only recognized him, but remember his first and last name without having to ask. He helped me find the size I need and found a ring I loved on the first try from a pretty weak explanation of my preferences (since I really wasn't all that clear about what I liked or didn't like in the first place). He showed us a bunch of different options and was really knowledgeable about all the styles and settings that were available. We weren't planning on buying anything today, but we both feel better about being able to get (afford, namely) a great ring even on our young-couple budget. He also noticed how dingy my other ring is, and when he offered to clean it really quickly, he noticed that the stone was loose. He took it to someone in the back for me to have it tightened and cleaned while he showed us a few more options. So, I left with my old ring looking sparkly and new, and a real appreciation for the great customer service we received at Kevin Main. We definitely agree with the other Yelpers and wanted to write a review for a business that really deserves a great review. The store was nice, spacious, and clean, too, and in the heart of downtown. All around, it's a great local business that, you can tell, is serious when it comes to offering great service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rhGL9KV8fNPCIi4EOdeVtw"}
