I just graduated this year and I am already missing it. \n\nAt Pitzer you truly get the best of both worlds, small liberal arts feel, with the benefits of being able to branch out and meet totally different types of people from the other surrounding 4 claremont colleges. \n\nIf you are into the social sciences, media studies, and liberal types who like free beer and the occasional herbal therapy, then this is your place. \n\nI hate that it has the stereotype of being a total slacker/backup school. How exactly is a private liberal arts college with an acceptance rate of less than 20% considered a back up?? Move over Pomona, Pitzer is giving you a run for your money.... well maybe not considering Pomona's endowment dwarfs Pitzer's but these are simply details my friends.\n\nPitzer gave me the best college experience I could have asked for, I'd never trade it for the world... unless of course I got my own private Island with sexy model types, but again, simply details\n\n;-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "1Gt0R09SrVVbeyjBJRPpog"}
