Glad I made early reservations because it gave us (well, my wife mostly) a chance to take in the details, not only in the facility but also in the presentation of the buffet. We enjoyed the crab legs, oysters on the half shell, Mahi mahi with the olive tapenade, and of course huevos rancheros...the breakfast of champions! Mimosa's were very good too. Even our picky eater found something he liked..the pancakes and waffles. We were married here and enjoy coming on the special occasions and to the rath al fresco's . Unlike other events, there were quite a few kids at Mother's Day brunch, it was cool to see my two boys chatting away at the buffett with other kids. The Athenaeum never disappoints and we'll be back for next years Mother's Day brunch .", "business_id": "GKMydEdaiww2coboFDEQCg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-09", "type": "review"}
