I have been in search of some popsicle molds all over the place and of course Ikea had the perfect set for less than $2.\n\nTo have a satisfying experience at Ikea you need to be mentally prepared and smart about your trip.  Prepare for your senses to be overwhelmed. I recommend that you go in with a plan- know what you are looking for, make note of what you like, take some pics with your phone, and get out before you start impulse buying. If you decide to go to Ikea mid-day on Saturday prepare for a mass of people like you have never seen before. Pretty much any other time is doable. There is plenty of parking in the two story deck and the lot beside the building.  You can park right out front when you are loading up the Swedish gems your have just purchased.\n\nIf you plan on buying any small items keep in mind that Ikea does not provide bags.  They have tissue paper but other than that you are on your own.  Consider bringing a larger bag with you to prevent dropping your delightful new candles on the ground. Also keep in mind you will have to assemble most things you buy.  If you are unfortunate enough to be missing a screw or nail, Ikea has a whole section of these little pieces so your furniture can be properly assembled. \n\nAlso don't miss out on the $1 fro-yo or $4 six-pack of cinnamon rolls before you head out - perfect way to revive yourself after braving the labyrinth that is Ikea!", "type": "review", "business_id": "eKSSsmq0JKOtxYHcCEeGAg"}
