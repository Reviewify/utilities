Tons of cute clothes, shoes and accessories at middle-range prices (~$20-40 per item), close to campus and not to mention that AMAZING customer service. The staff is extremely helpful and personable, and I was treated more like a friend than a customer... as another Yelper said, SO REFRESHING!\n\nSway has been compared to Forever 21 a lot here on Yelp in terms of style, price and quality... I agree that the two are similar in all three respects, but that Sway is more eclectic in style, slightly higher in price, and of more inconsistent quality (that is, sometimes better, sometimes worse) than Forever.\n\nIf you have a few hours to pore over the racks and try things on, then Sway is definitely a worthwhile place to shop. The selection tends toward a younger, less conservative style, but there's still something for everyone - my roommate and I have very different fashion sense, and yet we've both come away with several pieces from Sway. I've also been told that they receive new shipments every week, so the turnover rate of their merchandise is extremely high. If you don't find something this week, then maybe next week!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vFZtaVUTNcZzd9xnju29SQ"}
