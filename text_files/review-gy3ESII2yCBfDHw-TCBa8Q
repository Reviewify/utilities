Yes it can be a bit spotty. But I also once had two waitresses and the hostess spend twenty minutes to help find my friend's wedding ring after he dropped it, so I certainly can't complain too much. The food? Here's what I've had there over the years: Pulled Pork Sandwich: One of the best I've had. I get it a lot, and never regret it. Comes with some pretty good french fries to boot. Nachos: My memory is that they were way over salted. I'd skip 'em, but then again I lived in Texas long enough to be a stickler for Mexican food. Hamburgers: Very solid, but a bit overpriced. If you just want a burger, there are plenty of places to get one that's just as good for less money. Weekend Brunch: I've been pleasantly surprised by the brunch. Everything I've had on the brunch menu has been extremely tasty. And unlike S&S or Friendly Toast, it isn't horribly overcrowded. (And as spotty as the service can be here, my worst experience at Tommy Doyle's surpasses by leaps and bounds my best experience at Friendly Toast.) In short, I wouldn't drive across town to come here, but if you're in the area and want a good sandwich, or a nice brunch that doesn't require a 60 min wait, then Tommy Doyle's is a good option.", "business_id": "SfWZsocz-eqeYO1YOvkPiw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-25", "type": "review"}
