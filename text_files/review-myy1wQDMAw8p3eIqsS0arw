The first time we were there, the restaurant was very busy. The food was excellent and the service was also. However the second time the place was half empty, but the service was slower and the food was good, but not excellent. Also, the glass of wine I ordered tasted like it had come from a bottle that had been open a little too long, although the waiter insisted that the bottle had just been opened. Unfortunately, the last time we were there the place was again half empty with slow service and the food was just ok. From what I understand, the owner of the Black Pearl is often on the premises and is very nice. Although I've never dealt with him, that reason alone makes me want to give the benefit of the doubt. And they have a good cocktail menu, although very expensive. I was disappointed that there appeared to be no changes to the menu between our visits. I'm torn between giving three and four stars, but I'm going to go with the more recent experiences and do three for now.", "business_id": "XO2t6MaYU7m47CA2PTdY0Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-13", "type": "review"}
