The piercer, Owen, was very nice, worked efficiently and made me feel comfortable. Since jewelry switching is a complimentary service, I had to wait an hour until Owen had some time in between clients to see me. \n\nThis is not the normal place I visit to get piercing work and I likely will not return. The place is very clean, as others have stated. But it does have this creepy massage parlor vibe. A big issue that I have with Chameleon is that the place where the body jewelry is sold is across the way from the actual piercing location. I know that this is probably the best for a high volume business, but I do not like having to speak to 2 separate people to discuss jewelry size and type. I definitely would not do this if I were planning to get a fresh piercing. The person who sold the body jewelry lacked expertise in the type of jewelry that I needed even though I brought in my old jewelry. I would never go to a place where the employees cannot judge the gauge simply by looking at it. Sorry, but the lack of experience shows. This is a great place to go if cleanliness and convenience are your only criteria. Otherwise, make the trip to see Mark at Piercing Emporium in Worcester. \n\nDon't forget to tip your piercer for a job well done.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FzXdnDqbb0CRf4cYIz8hA"}
