They have all sorts of sandwiches to choose from but it depends on who makes it.They always have a special; soup and  sandwich or something. I don't like their baggette because it's so hard that all your goodies slip out when you try to sink your teeth in. I'm really picky about how easy or hard it is to actually eat my food though,no dripping juices out the bottom and I shouldn't have to rearrange the whole thing before I eat it. That being said, pizza is always a safe bet here, they used to have awesome soups but now they don't change it up enough.  I'm not a beer loving person so I can't comment on that but I've heard good things. Beware too of the grumpy lady whose taking orders sometimes, she's just a huge B word and her facial expressions at you are irritated and just plain B. I boycotted the place for months before because I refused to go back after how that lady treated me, that being said I would probably go in again, the people who have worked their a long time are way cool and nice, the guy with the glasses and lady who always wears some sort of long skirt with stripey stockings or something:) Oh yeah, and stay away from their garlic bread it's nuked and rubbery. 3 stars because you could spend 12 bucks on lunch when you only want to spend 5", "business_id": "WxUTo2tUjcN5AxA6UzRFfw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-25", "type": "review"}
