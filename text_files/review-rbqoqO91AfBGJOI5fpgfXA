Everything was delicious, they generously let us and the other customers try just about everything we wanted to sample.  My favorites were the watermelon radish ahi tuna and the poached salmon was delicious.  Hubby had one of the stews with rice, all of the stews were tasty but to me, we tried several, but all a bit salty.  The go to items for me would be the various veggie based sides plus a protein to add to it.  The only food item I tried that I did not like was the couscous with mushrooms.  The watermelon lemonade was so delicious and I didn't think it was too sweet (and I don't usually drink any sweetened juices or lemonades).  They do offer an unsweetened lemonade of the day but I tried that and thought it was nasty.  You should ask the workers what their favorites are, they will tell you like it is and offer you sample. We also tried the banana cake, it was decent but nothing I couldn't resist.  Next time I want to try the coconut layer cake.  Overall, I give this place a 5 star rating because I am really excited that a place like this opened in Pasadena.  This would be an awesome place to get picnic take out for the Hollywood Bowl.  I look forward to many tasty healthy meals here.", "business_id": "BvqXdJ4iadG5BfMWExX5dw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-18", "type": "review"}
