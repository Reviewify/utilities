No complaints about the service. The atmosphere is good inside, except for the soundtrack. You would thank that a cocktail bar with the style of ambience they build with the decor would play music to match, but instead the seem to have stolen their music library from any given poppy classic rock station. It came off as weird and mismatched. Otherwise a fun place with very nice drinks, and it's cool that they have a rotating barrel-aged cocktail. I didn't have any food here because they close the kitchen too damn early.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HJChzf3yFkJfPNBU4vC8mQ"}
