We time it just perfectly when it's starting to slow down just a little but right when the person handling the people waiting switched from the first guy that was magically managing almost everything in his head over to a girl that had to sort through the quick notes on who was waiting.  I wait with my friend a little longer then get seated.  \nThere's something about the brunch menu, it might just not fit my taste but there seem to be a lot of simple seeming regular items and a mix of salmon heavy specials.  Play it safe and go for a regular omlette and while we're waiting I make some casual comments and that's when the interesting thing happens, our waiter sort of disappears.  We can still spot him from time to time but it's not like he's checking in.  Did something happen, is he somehow offeended?  Our food shows up and the omlette is quite good but our coffees that we ordered are AWOL. \nIt's a little more interesting though, they come over with their tablet device with the bill on it and one coffee that didn't show up was on there but the other one somehow never even got entered, they remove the one that was on the bill without any issue but I can't figure out what happened.  \nWhy didn't our drinks show up, how is it that only one was even on the bill, why did our waiter kind of skip out.  Every good brunch place that I've been to will check by on a regular basis to make sure that your coffee is full, if you haven't even brought the coffee you've seriously fucked up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bul_5Ahk_QYLUAJ4Od27jg"}
