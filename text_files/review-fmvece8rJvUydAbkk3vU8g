The chicken entree for dinner was good, although a little boring. I don't even recall what came with it, if anything. The roasted tomato on foccacia was also nice, but unimaginative and didn't really pop. My lunch ally ordered the chicken skewers, which I was able to finagle a bite of. We agreed that for all intents and purposes, it was really just a gyro though. Am I ordering the wrong things here? Should I have gone with their famous mussels? The cappuccino was pretty satisfying.", "business_id": "F6Qsav77WqGhstQ1E2xRGQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-22", "type": "review"}
