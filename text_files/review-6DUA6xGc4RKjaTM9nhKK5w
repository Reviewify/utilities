So, I was on my way to dinner when I saw this little microbrewery tucked away in this small business center. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Two standouts for me was the nitro-pour Stenner Creek Stout. It was nice, creamy and smooth and had a lovely coffee flavor. It was light bodied in a way, definitely less thick than a Guinness. It surprised me. Very little bitterness and a clean finish. Awesomeness. I also really liked their Vespertin Belgian Dubbel. It had a nice caramel flavor and was a nice amber color. I think this might age well. So I will keep it around and see how it tastes after 6 months or so. I had a chance to taste their Pumpkin Ale as well and it has a very bright and clean pumpkin flavor and is easy on the spice. It's actually a clean drinking ale with a smooth finish.
