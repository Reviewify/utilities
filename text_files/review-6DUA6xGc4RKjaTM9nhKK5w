The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  \n\nTwo standouts for me was the nitro-pour Stenner Creek Stout.  It was nice, creamy and smooth and had a lovely coffee flavor.  It was light bodied in a way, definitely less thick than a Guinness.  It surprised me.  Very little bitterness and a clean finish.  Awesomeness.\n\nI also really liked their Vespertin Belgian Dubbel.  It had a nice caramel flavor and was a nice amber color.  I think this might age well.  So I will keep it around and see how it tastes after 6 months or so.  \n\nI had a chance to taste their Pumpkin Ale as well and it has a very bright and clean pumpkin flavor and is easy on the spice.  It's actually a clean drinking ale with a smooth finish.\n\nRandom musings from Jules...who LOVES BEER!", "type": "review", "business_id": "a79PKJkJw0-agf3rZEsIFA"}
