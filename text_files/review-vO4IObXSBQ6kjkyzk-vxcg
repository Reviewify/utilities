Lots of room outside and in, cheap drinks and good food at a good price. Its great to have veggie food at a bar that isn't cheese and/or deep fried! The portobello mushroom sandwich is delicious. The staff is always available to take more orders, don't mind splitting checks for groups, and there is a wide selection of drinks available.", "business_id": "D6SCh4BwNb52wZIqXdS4JQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}
