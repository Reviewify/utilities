Everyone here is super nice and helpful as always. Funny, too. ;o)  Selections are always wonderful. I highly recommend premade single meals from any of the Trader Joe's you go to. They're awesomely priced and guilt free! Much better than any drive-thru.  Also...the college boys that work here are nice to look at. haha!", "business_id": "6_0l_PhBgQEH-7akT8x5WQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-28", "type": "review"}
