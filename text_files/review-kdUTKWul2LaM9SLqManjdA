On a good(?) day, you might also catch a novice paraglider lose control of his landing and gently but awkwardly smack into an oblivious, unsuspecting spectator.\n\nWe finally mustered up the huevos to try it a few weeks back. They told us we'd be up in 40 minutes, and the lightest of our trio had the time of his life with an amazingly inspirational tandem partner. After an hour and a half, the other two of us were \"probably coming right up.\" After over two hours, they were unsure if the wind was going to cooperate anymore.
