The grooming staff is so stuck up and they do a terrible job. I came here with a family friend's dog and they completely butchered him and later blamed the dog for being fidgety. Completely untrue. As soon as we got home, he cowered into a corner and started shaking which is completely out of the character for him.\n\nThe PetHotel is cute, I like being able to watch the dogs play when I'm waiting for my movie @ AMC downstairs, but as some have mentioned it *is* expensive and you can probably find better care elsewhere. Drive a few miles to a nice boutique type hotel and trust me your dog will be happier.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hr597HbGWAp9UbF2JyhOgQ"}
