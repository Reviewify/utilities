I don't know why all these people are complaining about the staff. I've always found them to be helpful and courteous, and I go there a lot to buy booze for my underage friends. The prices are also surprisingly good. I thought everyone would be a lot more expensive but they're pretty comparable to Spec's. The only downside is that their beer selection isn't so great, but I can live with that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r2tGnRK5aHhclXYnJ-8djg"}
