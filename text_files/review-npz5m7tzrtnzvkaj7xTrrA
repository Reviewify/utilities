So what?  I used to live in France, and look back with fond memories on the days I spent waiting as the guy on the street corner made a fresh crepe for me and filled it with ham and cheese.  Oh man, so good.  \n\nBut who the hell expects an authentic French experience at a place called Crepes A Go-Go?  Seriously?
