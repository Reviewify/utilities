I haven't seen them since the late 80s/early 90s\" -- she responded with \"Yes, they do... and I'm buying a pair.\"\n\nThere were lots of different styles of shoes, a handful were complete throw backs. There were some that were cute, some that were god awful ugly, and some that looked like they cost -- cheap. The ones my friend got were cute little sneakers, and were inexpensive... and I will not elaborate on their smell, but let's just say I hope they air out well. (She claims they do).\n\nThere was also an area of the store that had clothing and bags. I didn't really browse around this area as my friend was checking out... but it looked like they might have some cute items.\n\nI'd just say buyer beware here... know what you're getting and the quality you're getting before you decide to buy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TpHXN_hwEi1fyv0rOvaf1Q"}
