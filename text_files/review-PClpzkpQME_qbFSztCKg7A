This review is about 15 years out of date, by the way, but from the others here it looks like nothing's changed.  That's a good thing. Mike's was always the burger destination for our group, as theirs were pretty much the best in town.  The pizza was also generous and fairly good.  After a long day of classes and an afternoon of 'studying', nothing beat a Mike's burger, except maybe $5 pitchers of Guinness at the Underground or nickel Beast at the Balcony.  Bet they don't do that anymore. Also sounds like the service hasn't changed in the last decade-and-a-half -- they were always bog-slow, probably due to being really really busy. My cousin's kid is going to Tech next year; perhaps it's time to pay her, and Mike's, a visit!", "business_id": "nXXfB3-tIIZczK4byP8JWQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}
