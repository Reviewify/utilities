They have a lot of different sandwiches so make sure you try as many as you can! Prices are low so it's great for lunch! Sandwich reviews: Pollo - pretty good, would definitely order it again. Porchetta - very boring and bland. Tastes like a cheap ham and cheese. Melanzana - very good. I'm not a vegetarian but this one is great. Soup reviews: Tomato - AWESOME Italian Wedding - Not bad at all. I'd order it again, The only bottled water they have in their cooler is sparkling, and while you can ask for tap water, be forewarned that it'll come in a tiny cup and be room temperature.", "business_id": "1kHV-hdQXDLeyRyrxn4p7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}
