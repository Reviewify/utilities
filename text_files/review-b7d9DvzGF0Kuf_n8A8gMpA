I was going there every day. \n\nOf course, I couldn't keep doing that, so I took a while off. When I came back, and every time I've been there since, I've been treated at best indifferently and at worst rather rudely by the staff, for simply showing up to buy their product, from what I can tell.  \n\nThey consistently turn off everything much earlier than the posted store close time, and have taken away the utensils for the toppings while rushing me to hurry up so they can close early, while I'm quite visibly still in the middle of using them. Additionally, on several occasions, I have arrived there to find them closed while the sign in the window indicates they should be open.\n\nUnless the management and employees suddenly rediscover the value of treating their customers with a degree of kindness, I recommend going across the street to Wasabi Bistro, or to Cold Stone Creamery just down the street if you want a nice treat *and* want to be treated with respect. \n\nSince several of these ongoing issues happened again tonight to me, my fiance, and two of our friends, I have decided to take my business elsewhere from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_m1HXLFYjIkA7VvQQ1M7Wg"}
