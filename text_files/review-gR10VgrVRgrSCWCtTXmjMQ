We ordered a few sandwiches and a burger here with drinks for a little under $40 (split among four people). That's one of the best pub deals I've had in awhile. The portion sizes are quite generous too so if you're looking for a good hearty meal, definitely check out this neat pub right near the university. There's also a nice back patio so if it's nice outside, this would definitely be a good place to enjoy a beer, your meal or both. I like pubs in general but this one is definitely pretty high on the scale.\n\nOh yeah, I forgot to state that the drinks are more expensive before dinner than they are after. I guess happy hour is the only time when it's cheap during the week, at least that's what I'm assuming.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Uqfkk4hxB2HoJgxvnmpkRw"}
