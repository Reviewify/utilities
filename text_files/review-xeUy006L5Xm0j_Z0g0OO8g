My schnauzer tends to get very nervous when being groomed, even when I am the one doing the grooming and sometimes gets a little nippy. Here they kept me constantly updated, letting me know that they were going to take a little more time to ease her nerves. The couple that owns this location are very hands-on, doing the grooming, greeting, and making phone calls. They are obviously pet lovers because they know how to handle those hard to handle babies. They are very quick, typically taking under two hours to finish the job. Much, much quicker than your typical chain groomers. I will continue to visit this location and would quickly recommend The Pet Play Place to anyone who is looking for a groomer.", "business_id": "kSALJHCAmN3Nxk_LiL-CBw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}
