Is it one of the best tasting pizzas you will ever get in New York? No. Is it one of the the best tasting pizzas at the BIGGEST size and BEST bang for your buck? YES. \n\nSo just picture those trays that you use to put your food on like at McDonald's.. the slice of ONE pizza is THAT long AND wide. At first I was like.. $3.50 for ONE slice?? But after I saw it and split it with my boyfriend, I was full for the REST of the day. If you're ordering just for yourself, you probably will only get through half, save the other half for the next meal, and voila! $3.50 for two meals! I love this place. Definitely getting them delivered to my apartment when it starts to snow!", "type": "review", "business_id": "A46G2OAvLxFswiONB50Rrg"}
