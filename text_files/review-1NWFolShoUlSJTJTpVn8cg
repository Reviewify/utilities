The staff is super freindly, the smoothies are delicious and all of the equipment is  top of the line.  The gym is never too packed (although I am sure that will change as the membership grows) so you do not have to show up in advance for classes.  I look forward to them expanding the class schedule (there is no kickboxing or pilates) yet but otherwise no complaints.  Every aerobic machine has a personal tv and ipod hookup. love it love it love it!  Once I tried it I had to join.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YJB2Cj5z4x80-kUSrg_9A"}
