It means I'll have to drive out to UCSD, pay for parking, deal with a bunch of teens that think they are cool for being vegan anarchists, and then go into the Che Cafe and smell the melange of aromas --old couch, b.o., cigarettes, possibly a hint of cat urine?-- that only make me think of some crazy old hoarder lady's house.\n\nOh, a quick tip:  If you order tickets online for will-call, the kids working the door will have no idea what you are talking about and will just let you in.  They run a tight ship here, as would be expected.  I'm not sure why inefficiency seems to be synonymous with anti-establishment.\n\nWhy two stars?? I don't know.  There is some small part of my heart that is still glad that they are a venue that puts on punk shows even if they do it as crappily as possible.  \n\np.s. i HATE the cigarette smoking.  most of the outdoor area is unbearable and it also wafts into the venue itself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tJ14WtRSonB4Xo7Nl5YOEA"}
