I am having my rehearsal dinner here in September and Tiana has been WONDERFUL about helping me plan all of the details. Honestly, I wish Tiana was the contact person at my wedding venue because she makes me feel at ease about everything. I am a frantic bride and have planned everything for my big day in the last three months. Tiana has gotten back to all of my emails within a day and is more than willing to take on her fair share of work for me. She has been great about referring vendors, getting price quotes for me from rental companies, and letting me know exactly how to plan everything. Allied Arts Guild is a really beautiful and classy venue. There's a Sunset room where you can have a wedding slideshow and also a patio to put chairs for a nice dinner. . You will be in good hands if you choose this venue and you definitely won't be let down!", "business_id": "QBsXp1LFVrWgQ-OhtgAwZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-15", "type": "review"}
