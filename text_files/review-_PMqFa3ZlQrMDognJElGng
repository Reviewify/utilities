I can't believe it has so many bad reviews!\n\nThe atmosphere is noisy, but bright and fun. Decent selection of local beer; bartenders are variable, depending on who's working. Love the white pizzas... mmm. Yes, they have TV's at the booths, but the sound quality is pretty poor, and when it's crowded you won't be able to hear it anyways. I didn't find them to be too much of an annoyance... and definitely a good conversation starter if you get an awkward moment.\n\nI will definitely keep coming here. A fun place to go with friends if you're not into bar hopping on weekends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rx9X9thYgNImhZWe4o010w"}
