And the \"faux\" part is not necessarily an insult. The \"mediocre\" part might be.\n\nI've had better nachos at the Cheesecake Factory (meh...it's a chain, and it's a chain that doesn't even serve faux Mexican food, so the comparison seems warranted).\n\nSomeone I know recommended this place - in fact, she repeatedly raved about it. Said the margaritas were mighty good and the food delish. I still don't know about the margaritas, but I don't really even trust her on that (she has shitty taste in drinks as well as food). Besides, Chili's and Olive Garden are her favorite haunts (the latter serves something I like to call the 'Tour of Diarrhea'). But I do trust others who are quick to say happy hour is bitchin', so I may return, solely for that.\n\nMy taquitos had these shitty mushrooms in them. Beefy bellas, these weren't. It threw off the flavor and texture. The filling was, generally speaking, mush.\n\nMy friend, who generally speaking dislikes Mexican food (but was a sport throughout the meal) was charged for something she shouldn't have been and brought it to the manager's(?) attention. You would think, like, he'd do something about it and fix the bill. Nope. Nothing. She was firm but polite and got zero results.\n\nMediocre food + shit service = 2 stars. The extra star is because I've had worse faux Mexican (and some extremely good faux Mexican, as well). Shoulda gone to Tequila's instead...or Chipoltle.\n\nHmmm. Judging from these reviews, at 23, I might already be too old for this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2PWmnUV2Leb2Loj0TqxCMA"}
