Asked for water over and over again which was given to us at the end of our meal in a very nasty pitcher full of sauce.\nOne of the kids received her order and started eating when a very upset waitress came by to yell at us that they made a mistake and the  meal was for someone else.\nThe food seemed/tasted old so we barely ate. The restroom are really gross, and at the end we waited another 45 minutes to get our check....\nThey had included the gratuity which we refused to pay by principle.\nI am from West Africa and felt awfully embarrassed to have my friends go through this experience. I walked in proud to share part of our culture, a good, tasty meal as we know so well how to make them. I came knowing that for the Senegale culture the word \"Teranga\" which means \"hospitality\" is one of their values. Although run by Senegalese, this place has nothing warm and hospitality has obviously no meaning in their vocabulary.\nI walked in proud to share what Africa is all about and walked out a bit ashamed by the whole thing. I will never go back and will never recommend this restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZcTI78WOKE-iLAzAGccOvA"}
