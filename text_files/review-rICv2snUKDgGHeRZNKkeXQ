Now, I didn't want to upset her by never going; especially since my usual option was heading back to Providence to my regular shop. \n\n   I took a walk and ended up in front of the store one evening. To my dismay, they had closed for the night. I ended up heading back there the following day, and I'm really glad that I did. \n   The selection there is extensive. They have brands and types of cigars that I've never seen before, and I've been puffing on cigars for a while now. There is also many types of cigarettes, cigarillos and bulk tobacco that you can purchase. They offer other items too; as if you were shopping in a 1920's general store. From classic style grooming items for men, like shaving soap and straight razors to handmade board games and antique signs. \n  The staff there are all very polite and informative. I spend one day just being bounced from side to side by the staff on recommendations, suggestions and opinions on cigars, humidors and tobacco. A must stop for anyone who likes quality service and selection with a hint of antiquity.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VZpQcqoRapvmqcPkwImJhQ"}
