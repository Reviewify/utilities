Well, I suppose I do. First off, the parking is a bit awkward. There aren't any signs out front telling us where to park. If there are, they weren't prominent enough. Then the restaurant itself is a bit unfinished.. look up at the ceiling and there are spackle marks.. someone forgot to paint? Some wallpaper is hanging off in the bathroom too.. Just a bit of sloppiness but enough to make me feel the care isn't there yet.\n\nThe menu was pretty cool, but the second page is just a list of farms.. a bit goofy but I'm ok with it I suppose.\n\nService was as expected, very good and attentive. \n\nFood was mixed. Some plates were really good and some were just ok. Dessert was decidedly unspecial (and we tried a bunch of them). \n\nBest thing I've had in a restaurant in a long time was the Colorado Lamb Spareribs. If you like meat, this is a must order dish. \n\nThe bread and butter was awesome.. now don't laugh. This is very important to me!\n\nDrinks were ok. I always like to try a specialty cocktail so I ordered the Southeaster. I was later told that they were out of something they needed to make it.. how does a bar run out of ingredients for a specialty cocktail? I next went for the Zephr, which was really gingerry and not too great.. I went with water after that.\n\nGot the Flatbread.. eh.. ok.. nothing special.\n\nGot the chefs garden crosne. This was an odd vegtable, one I never had before. It was interesting and fun to eat, but wasn't too flavorful.. I'd skip it if I were you.\n\nThere was a special fish plate : Halibut. It was perfectly cooked but that didn't translate to the overall flavor. I think it was a 3 star dish.. as a special entr\u00e9e I'm looking for more. \n\nI think that I won't be back.. There are better places in town, and better Garces places too..", "type": "review", "business_id": "p1257iwsyKj00D_145O03w"}
