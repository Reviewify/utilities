No meat, just veggies. Whenever the craving hits, I head down the path to Earthen Jar. It's a rather humble Ann Arbor institution right next door to Jerusalem Garden, and often not nearly as crowded. True, not everything on the buffet is spectacular, but they have plenty of  options to choose from! I can always find at least five favorites to keep my palate (and phyto-deprived tummy) happy. Things can get a bit expensive, especially if you're very hungry and load up your plate with heavy stuff like the spicy potatoes (*ahem*guilty*ahem*), but unlike the other more inexpensive Indian joints around town, EJ offers a LOT of vegan and veg options. If you budget well, you can still probably have two meals for under $10. Their lassis are a different story.  Yes they are sweet, creamy and refreshing, but waaaay overpriced. Much more than the grub. Still, it is a nice indulgence every so often.", "business_id": "AqyDXaob6pF7zE2s9nFR2w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-04", "type": "review"}
