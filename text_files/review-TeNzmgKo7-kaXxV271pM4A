Grendel's happy hour is really the only time I think I'd eat there, because the half-priced appetizers aren't quite full-size portions. Between 5:30 and 7:30 every day you can get this splendid deal, provided that you consume $3 worth of drinks. While they do have a decent beer selection, the food really can't quite make up for it because not only are the portions a little suspect, but the taste isn't spectacular either. If you're thinking of getting drunk in the afternoon, then hit up Grendel's at 5:30 and eat until you drop. Otherwise, you can do better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
