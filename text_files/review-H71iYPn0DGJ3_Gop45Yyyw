To me, Sonrisa is the girl who doesn't really have anything to say but dresses up to seem \"classy\".  That sounds harsh, but you all know what (or who) I'm talking about.  This latest \"modern mex\" addition to UVillage is an attempt at some belltown/bellevue-esque dining/happy hours.  The food was \"pretty\" but also pretty boring.  Service was definitely nice and you get two stars for trying.  Still... I'd rather head up to the Ave for some good food, cheap prices, and no service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7sBIv30fhszkBsv0kkSBCg"}
