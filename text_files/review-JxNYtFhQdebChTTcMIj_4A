Besides the dorms, you can't rent movies anyplace close without driving. If you're into comics it's the best selection in the tri state area. And the beads...oh the beads!! It has been rumored that Von's is the largest retailer of natural stone beads in the COUNTRY. On top of that, they have the funniest greeting cards, little gifty things, and books + records for every taste.\n\nAfter spending 2 years shopping here, I decided to apply for a job. Although I may be biased as an employee for 2.5 years, I ended up being one of Von's best customers. Damn you, John, your store is so awesome that I would find a million things I wanted then my paycheck disappeared! :-)\n\nI learned how to make jewelry while working here - real, quality jewelry - and now sell it on the side for extra income. Even living in San Francisco/Berkeley now I can't find a bead shop for my supplies quite like Von's.\n\nThings you can find at Von's:\nmovie rentals\nCDs\nrecords\nposters\npurses/bags\nextensive greeting card selection\nstickers\nbeautiful jewelry - stone and sterling silver from around the world\nbody jewelry you can't even find at a tattoo parlor\ncraft supplies\nbeads - literally millions (stone, Czech glass, metal, Swarovski, lucite, African Trade)\njewelry classes\ncandles and incense - really quality scents and brands\ngifty things\nroom full of stones and gems (knowledgeable staff for questions)\ncomics\nused books\ntextbooks\nnew books for every subject and genre", "type": "review", "business_id": "NhQhIdDqxEKnhEwoekw0jw"}
