Locker room: A bit small, but clean. The room could use a bit more space to put your things. Products available for use: Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and shaving cream, shower caps, q tips in the showers. Hair spray, gel, combs, hair dryer, body lotion, and qtips/cotton pads in the locker room Whirlpool: This was my favorite place to relax! It is located outdoors with a table and surrounding lounge chairs. The whole area is enclosed by trees and plants so you can soak up the sun and rest in privacy! Eucalyptus sauna: This room was the perfect temperature. I've been in saunas where it is way too hot! There were nice iced towels ready outside for when you come out. Relaxation/quiet room: Lots of fluffy chairs to sit in with dim lighting. There is a door leading to the outside with an outdoor fireplace and table/seats. Flavored water and assorted teas were available, as well as varieties of fresh fruit. Massage room: Very comfortable bench. I just noticed that there is an outdoor area where you can get a massage under a nice little tent! There is no extra charge, it just has to be requested! Pedicure: 2 pedicure stations that are very unique. You step up and sit down. Your feet are elevated so it is easier for the manicurist to give you your pedicure. The polish selection was also decent. Overall, a great experience at the spa. It is a little spa, but great when you want a quiet day and not share a facility with too many people. The staff were all professional and very friendly. Hope to be making a visit back here soon!", "business_id": "zjDwn8LynUzPTeuEkPbRcg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-18", "type": "review"}
