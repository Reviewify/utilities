Good portion size, fast service, good price. I see some people complain about the broth being bland, but I put all the sprouts, lime, and basil in mine so I don't notice any difference. And if you put hioisin or Rooster sausce on it then that's all you'll taste anyways :) Besides, who eats Pho plain? They don't give you a free can of soda like the place downtown (Big Bowl), but the tradeoff is you don't have to seach for parking downtown. Bring Cash! One side note regarding all Pho restaurants. The menu's are completely annoying. There are about 5 different meats to choose from, and a few \"other\" options. Instead of listing every possible combination to make your menu look full, they could simplify the whole menu to three lines. List the bowl size options, and the ingredient options below that.
