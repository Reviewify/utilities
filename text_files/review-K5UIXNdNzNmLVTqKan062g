Great for smokers and people who want to chat rather than listen to blaring top 40's (or country) music.  Even on the rowdiest Saturday night, you can always manage to find seats outside.  Why can't bars in Manhattan be this awesome??? Oh yeah, $$$$/sq footage.  Oh, and the below freezing weather for 2/3 of the year...I am going to enjoy Houston before going back to that madness!  But, Ginger Man deserves a 5 in my book, and I don't even like beer. In fact, I frequented it 3 times during my 5.5 week stay in Houston.  Even on St. Patrick's Day when Morningside Dr. was complete mayhem, the bartenders were efficient and kept the wait at the bar bearable.  I also loved the live band, the bagpipe performance, and the free goodies they were passing out that night.   I won't minus any stars for the multiple \"lose the fruit!\" calls I got from guys whilst drinking my delicious Hoegaarden w/ lemon.", "business_id": "IUm-Bh9up7n2hQigcylf7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-21", "type": "review"}
