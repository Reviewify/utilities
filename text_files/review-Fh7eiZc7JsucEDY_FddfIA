Highly recommended!  Extra cozy during the winter time.  Excellent wine list, absolutely delicious food.  Interesting and tasty specials.  Good service.  The marinara that they give with the bread is outstanding.  I've had the rigatoni siciliana, the gnocchi, a couple different apps including a boar sausage & broccoli rabe app -- outstanding!...everything is wonderful.  Had a decadent berry tart as well -- totally homemade tasting.  Friendly service.  A tiny bit cramped, so don't go in there with your string bass.  But great spot to cozy up with a date!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w"}
