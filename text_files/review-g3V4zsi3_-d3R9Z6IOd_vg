I haven't had Indian food in Austin, so I didn't really know what to expect. My brother and I split the veggie samosas and they were awesome. Crispy shell and just the right amount of spice in the center. We then split a selection of currys across the table. The standouts were the saag paneer and veggie ayam. With plenty of naan and long grain rice for everyone at the table. We all had more than enough food and it was DELICIOUS. I find myself thinking of ways I can justify going again in the next few days.\n\nThe only reason I docked a star is because they don't split the checks. It was kind of a pain since we were a larger group.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KK-6rXbIo9B4-b_P5WO5Qg"}
