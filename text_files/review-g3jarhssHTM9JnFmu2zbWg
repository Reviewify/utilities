My favorite so far has been \"Of Dice & Men,\" which I saw with my wife last weekend.  It's a great show, albeit very geeky.  Anyone who's ever played D&D, Magic the Gathering, or even WOW should see this show.\n\nThe theater space is in the basement of La Val's in Berkeley.  While you can bring your beer and pizza downstairs to watch the show, I recommend eating upstairs, and just bring the drinks.  Less messy that way!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DxyqiEQF_AP_YsuBWcFnjQ"}
