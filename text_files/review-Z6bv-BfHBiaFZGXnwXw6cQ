Found this place in a search with good reviews and that $29.99 coupon from smogtips.com. It's a very small hidden place located behind the car wash--you have to drive around the back of the car wash to find it. It's basically the test bay and a tiny office. The technician was quiet but seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He was finishing up a test right before me, and even with that I think it took longer to get my car washed afterward. The coupon came with a free exterior car wash. Overall, I'll probably be back, especially when the DMV starts requiring a \"test only\" site for my car. Great experience. I've been to much worse places. Happy customer here!", "business_id": "IQpohksufCBmGJYZCsZf7g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}
