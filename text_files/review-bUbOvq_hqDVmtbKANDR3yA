Usually at the Mongolian Grill places I have been to it is all you can eat. Also, you need to make sure a couch is available in the near future for moving around can be a painful experience.  But at Ruzhen you only get one bowl for about $9, and this sucker is huge. There is no way I would go and get a refill after eating one of these, though a refill is definitely a good deal if you can eat that much. After filling it with a lot of chicken, a lot of noodles, and a lot of fresh veggies, I still had a lot of room left over. So naturally, I went and filled it up some more. Despite being such a good deal, I had the same problem as Kimberley where I could not taste the sauces that I put on it. I wanted the medium and added the amount they recommended. I don't know if I added enough (again, I added what they recommended) but I could not taste the flavor of the sauces. If I come here again, which seems likely, I will make sure I will add more than what the sign recommends and see if it is because the bowl was so big you needed more. I also wanted to point out that the cute cashier girl was really nice and the place was spacious, so I could go and eat like a pig in the corner and not worry about someone next to me judging me.
