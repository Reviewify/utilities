Overall, the rooms are great inside. The layout of the hotel is a bit odd. You can't take an elevator from your room to the ground floor. You have to either switch elevators on the second floor or take an elevator to the second floor and then take the stairs. Bizarre and inefficient. They offer a very nice breakfast buffet that seemed reasonably priced for how extensive it was (with a wide array of hot and cold items and an omelet station)! The main drawback is that the rooms are not very dark. Light seeps from the hallway from under the door, there is something on the ceiling (a smoke detector maybe?) that flashes blue light constantly, and the fancy touch pad that controls the lights glows like a little night light.", "business_id": "bjkA3ustWdg3EsTLRiUNKA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-09", "type": "review"}
