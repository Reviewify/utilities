The tart yogurt is my favorite and the toppings always tasted fresh, especially fruit ones like blueberry and strawberry. Yogurt Express is tucked away in a corner of Westwood, so maybe that's why it doesn't attract as many customers.  My favorite toppings here are cheesecake and white chocolate, after strawberry. (Strawberry + tart yogurt = my ideal combination!) The service is friendly and had a discount program for UCLA students I think. If in fact Yogurt Express no longer exists, I will dearly miss it.", "business_id": "Z1g_o-Cgjdd4KlA8ORNOoA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-01", "type": "review"}
