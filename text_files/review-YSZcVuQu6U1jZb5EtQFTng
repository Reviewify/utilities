But it has remained my (our) go-to sushi joint in the greater Princeton area for the past six years for more than just sentimental reasons.  \n\nTheir Green Dragon roll (eel roll with a healthy dose of avacado layered over it, topped with tobiko) is an all-time favorite.  Sharing a Bridge (for two) or a Boat (for three or four) is usually a good bet for a fun dinner.  These are both nice \"surprise\" assortments of sushi, sashimi and rolls (even though it does always include a boring California roll as part of the mix).  \n\nThe inside decor is not particularly noteworthy.  The better spot is the outside patio, open during the non-winter months.  And, no offense to the Princeton students, but my favorite time to hit the patio is the summer months when school is out of session -- it's usually less crowded and, uh, less \"scholarly\".  \n\nAs with many restaurants in this area, Ichiban is BYO.  For wine (or saki), there is an excellent shop just a moment's walk down Hulfish street called the Princeton Corkscrew.  For beer, a short walk up Witherspoon (towards campus) will get the job done.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mg0_Sc27pje8Yrt40meKyg"}
