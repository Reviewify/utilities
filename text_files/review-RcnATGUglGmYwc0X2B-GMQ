Nothing like a good burst of fruityness to your morning or refreshing break in your afternoon, with the millions of flavors, you can't go wrong! I've visited this UT location at least a dozen times and am always pleased to be greeted with bright smiling employees who are just so cheery. Hmmm..... wonder how many shots of boost they put in their juice? Haven't been disappointed yet, and with the many times I've gone, don't think I will either.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lUSKL05WeAYYzV_Bd-vZ5g"}
