Yaaaaayyyyy!!! I get a couple \"dark n' stormies\" (they have the BEST ones) and a plate of Salvadoran vegetables with tofu and rice, and always leave stuffed, happy, and kinda drunk. Sure, the food isn't amazing, but it's decent, filling, and when it's half price, my dinner always costs less than a drink... I speak for the broke asses of Boston when I say, that's a freakin' sweet deal man! People have pretty much covered the ambiance and the bathrooms, so I'll keep it short: Ambiance= chill and cozy, like there should be a fireplace in the corner and a moose head on the wall or something.  Hot tip= no half priced food outside, sorry, but the patio IS nice! Bathrooms= coed, and confusing for drunk people. Yay Grendel's.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-04", "type": "review"}
