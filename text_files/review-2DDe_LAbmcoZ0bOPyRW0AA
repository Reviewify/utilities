Indeed, they had just packaged some baguette sandwiches- two choices I believe: one was a vegetarian. I opted for the Salami with New Zealand Cheddar and a vanilla bean jam of some kind. Great. Now that's all I can think about!\n\nThe girls working were very down to earth, helpful and friendly. I can't wait to come back and enjoy all of the stinky, runny cheeses!", "type": "review", "business_id": "oEO6MBB4wcW0HQG6DcP6cA"}
