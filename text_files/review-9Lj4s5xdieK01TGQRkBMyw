So now I'm trying all the ones in Houston.  \n\nBut I was NOT a fan of Celebrity and agree with a lot of the other comments re: service -- the woman at the counter was \"rude, doesn't smile and when you try to engage her, is uninterested\" (Amy M.).\n\nI tried the vanilla and strawberry.  Both were moist but a little too dense for my taste.  And I was confused as to why the strawberry cupcake was strawberry frosting on vanilla cake rather than strawberry frosting on strawberry cake.\n\nAnd why is it called Celebrity??  I was expecting Hollywood paraphernalia...\n\nTwo stars is a little harsh.  I'll review again once Crave opens up nearby because maybe competition will heat things up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AGKGrnG-Vj27A_PORbg1Cw"}
