So now I'm trying all the ones in Houston. But I was NOT a fan of Celebrity and agree with a lot of the other comments re: service -- the woman at the counter was \"rude, doesn't smile and when you try to engage her, is uninterested\" (Amy M.). I tried the vanilla and strawberry. Both were moist but a little too dense for my taste. And I was confused as to why the strawberry cupcake was strawberry frosting on vanilla cake rather than strawberry frosting on strawberry cake. And why is it called Celebrity?? I was expecting Hollywood paraphernalia... Two stars is a little harsh. I'll review again once Crave opens up nearby because maybe competition will heat things up!", "business_id": "AGKGrnG-Vj27A_PORbg1Cw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-06-28", "type": "review"}
