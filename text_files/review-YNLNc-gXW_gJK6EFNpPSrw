As mentioned in my previous review this place is constantly busy but for good reason. I always go for the pancakes here for breakfast and I never  leave disappointed.  If you can't find parking there's a perfect street near the 7-11, San Antonio St.. I love Austin int the fact that you don't have to pay meter's on Sunday.", "business_id": "fsqtrHKBUeucacxeX9FPaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-23", "type": "review"}
