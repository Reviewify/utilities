He has very good bedside manner, and has a calming effect on kids. He listens well, and gives practical advice. To combat frequent ear infections, we wound up putting tubes in her ears. We did not want to go with a doctor who is \"too eager to cut\" (perform surgery). Dr. Cheng was not like that at all. He did not push it, and even stated that he generally discourages the use of tubes. He gave us pros and cons, and put the decision in our hands. Given her hearing loss, we opted for the tubes. The surgery went well, and her hearing returned to almost 100% of normal. It was like a miracle. And, her frequent ear infections were basically eliminated (from 6+ per year it has been about 1 per year since). A year later, we returned to see him, because she was having sleep problems - frequently waking up due to breathing problems. Dr. Cheng diagnosed tonsil problems, and noted that the problem would persist. We decided to have her tonsils and adenoids removed. Again, Dr. Cheng did not push this at all, but agreed to do the surgery. The procedure went fine, and here sleep apnea disappeared immediately. This week, we saw Dr. Cheng. We had another great follow-up appointment with him. He even pulled some strings in arranging a spot hearing exam (due to my daughter leaving California at the end of this week)! As always, he was patient and kind, and was very happy to answer all of our question. Overall, he is an excellent ENT, is great with kids, and is very practical and conservative in his approach. He is outstanding!", "business_id": "jzp4CH2MgABM_4gVeVSTLw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-17", "type": "review"}
