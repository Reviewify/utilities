And I do eat eggs. Stopped in here for a quick breakfast with a friend. I decided to order a mushroom (or spinach or something, whatever, it wasn't memorable) frittata which I was told would come with a side. The exact statement from the guy behind the register was \"it comes with rosemary potatoes.\" Mushroom(?) frittata? Rosemary potatoes? All sounds veg to me, so I order it. When my food arrived at my table, I was horrified to see a giant chunk of bacon on top of my frittata. There were also many, many chunks of bacon in my \"rosemary potatoes.\" I was thinking, \"Do these people think they're funny?\" I was able to keep my composure. I'm not the type to cause a scene over some bacon, but really guys? Is it that hard to say that they would be \"bacon potatoes?\" I may come back if I must, but if not, then I won't.", "business_id": "3XwVZr6Jj2DnZ8B2W3RboQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}
