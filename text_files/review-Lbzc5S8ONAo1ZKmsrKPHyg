Pescatarian if you really want to get technical.  And I do eat eggs.\n\nStopped in here for a quick breakfast with a friend.  I decided to order a mushroom (or spinach or something, whatever, it wasn't memorable) frittata which I was told would come with a side.  The exact statement from the guy behind the register was \"it comes with rosemary potatoes.\"  Mushroom(?) frittata?  Rosemary potatoes?  All sounds veg to me, so I order it.  \n\nWhen my food arrived at my table, I was horrified to see a giant chunk of bacon on top of my frittata.  There were also many, many chunks of bacon in my \"rosemary potatoes.\"  \n\nI was thinking, \"Do these people think they're funny?\"\n\nI was able to keep my composure.  I'm not the type to cause a scene over some bacon, but really guys?  Is it that hard to say that they would be \"bacon potatoes?\"\n\nI may come back if I must, but if not, then I won't.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3XwVZr6Jj2DnZ8B2W3RboQ"}
