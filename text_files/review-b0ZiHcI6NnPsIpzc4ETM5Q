I'm surprised. I thought I'll be hungry after two hours, the way I feel when I have pho. \n\nHere, the noodles come in soft, medium or firm. I like firm and chewy. The soup is hot and has good flavor. It's decent meal before an evening class.\n\nThe only complaint I have is on the stools. The black wooden stools may be zen and Japanese, but try sitting for more than fifteen minutes. My butt doesn't surrender to the hard wood with monk-like calmness, but the raging samurai. It's hella uncomfortable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HSvxkRy8GQTZX56OFB4L-g"}
