There have been a few that have come and gone in the last few years (anyone remember the well intentioned disaster of a restaurant in the Crown Plaza Cabana, they actually served their \"rodizio\" by bringing you a plate of assorted meats...what's the point), but none have seemed to get it right. After walking by Pampas, I thought that this place might be the one that would stick. Last night, armed with lots of cash and an open heart, we decided to give Pampas a try. While I would probably go back, it was definitely not the best churassacaria I have ever been to. That said, if you plan to check out Pampas, to get the most of your experience I have the following suggestions/observations: - Seating: When you make your reservation make sure that you specify that you *do not* want to be seated on the bottom level. To maximize space, the restaurant has three levels. The bottom one (where we sat) feels like a basement that has been converted into a rec room and smelled a little like vinegar. Food: I liked the selection. The meat was good, but I think that the flavor of the meat at Espetus is better. The salad bar had some really great items (I loved the mashed yams with coconut and the watermelon salad), but I felt that most of the items were fusion for the sake of fusion. Value: Unless you are a vegetarian joining your meat loving friends for a night out, don't get the $27 all you can eat salad bar option. It just isn't good enough to warrant the price. Light eaters would probably be best served by ordering ala carte. Really, though skip lunch and go for the $44 all you can eat.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-07", "type": "review"}
