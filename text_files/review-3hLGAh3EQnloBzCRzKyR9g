The store is small and inconveniently located on the second floor. I was looking for a zipper pull for my ski jacket to replace the pair of pliers I've been using ever since my zipper pull broke. I ask a guy who works there and he takes me to the back of the store, where there are none. And then he looks somewhere else, where there are also none. *sigh* No zipper pulls? Then someone says they found an extra in a drawer that might work, it won't, but they give me a little tie thingie from it that might make do. And then he goes and gets me a twist tie thingie that definitely works, for now. I really appreciated the fact that they went out of their way to help me and gave me two temporary solutions (for free!) until I find one I can buy. So now I dont have to carry around pliers, and instead have a yellow twist tie attached to the zipper. Works pretty well. Thanks EMS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Svj0Ml7D7hcchrZZs7PCAg"}
