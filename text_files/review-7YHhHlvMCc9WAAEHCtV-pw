Frankly, I was surprised BUT it's not really reflective of their normal prices. I don't really have any luck at Goodwill or Value Village-like thrift stores when looking for clothes or shoes, but mostly useless and really cool junk is everywhere and all the more exciting. Some reasonably priced fine jewelry pieces, but mostly kind of crappy cool-looking stuff. Yay. Their tagged item discount days can truly be awesome. A find addition to the wretched, overpriced second-hand \"vintage BS\" that encapsulates Seattle shopping.
