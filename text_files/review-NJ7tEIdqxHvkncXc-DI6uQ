I could almost get past the fact that almost everything in there is overpriced, but there is a strong air of pretentiousness that just about every employee in the store shares. They act like it's painful for them to assist you...god forbid they waste their cool on you.  I was a bit stunned to see that a shirt I'd seen at a different chain store months ago was there, only the price was doubled. What the hell?  Value Village might not be considered as \"cool,\" but I'm more likely to find an awesome rare gem there than anything that's worth what you'd pay at Buffalo Exchange.", "business_id": "IenkIv6lG4knCp0rb_PhIw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}
