Some people say it's changed and I do think they skimp on the meat now (although they still give you a lot in your sandwiches...it just used to be even more than that) and use grape tomatoes instead of sliced roma tomatoes, it's still the same ol' place that has delicious salads and sandwiches.  \n\nI love love LOVE the honey wheat bread.  I can eat that all day long.  I heard before, you could get a bag full of the bread ends for a quarter or so, but I'm not sure if they still do that.  I usually get the BLTA, which is a BLT with AVOCADO.  The bacon is always crispy and never oily, which is amazing considering they make the sandwich as I'm walking through the line.  The salads are huge so get the dressing on the side (poppy seed is great) so you can save some of the salad for later.  They sometimes skimp on the salad but most of the time, they fill the bowl or plastic to go container up to the brim with spring mix, sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes and croutons!  I love how it also comes with a slice of pineapple sometimes, which is a perfect way to end the meal.  \n\nThere is usually a very long line, but it moves quickly.  The workers are a bit unfriendly sometimes, in both their appearance and attitude.  However, the food is always good and they move through the line quickly so I don't want to complain.  The main downside for me is that it only takes cash.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw"}
