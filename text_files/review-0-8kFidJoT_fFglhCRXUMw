Personally, eating right near People's park and telegraph? Call me snobby but let's be honest here people, it's not very pleasant eating outside the restaurant.  Burgers are about the same as its University Ave. and Euclid St. counterparts - standard sized burger, but nothing too crazy. I really felt like the bun didn't get that nice golden crispy look = disappointed kelly D: If you're in a hurry for a decent burger + fries, hit up bongo burger. If you're in the mood for a better burger... Well. It's berkeley. What do you expect??  Only 2 nomstars!", "business_id": "G3d-xJF_Rt-P_za2eZ1q-Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-02", "type": "review"}
