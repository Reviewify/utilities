Call me snobby but let's be honest here people, it's not very pleasant eating outside the restaurant. \n\nBurgers are about the same as its University Ave. and Euclid St. counterparts - standard sized burger, but nothing too crazy. I really felt like the bun didn't get that nice golden crispy look = disappointed kelly D:\n\nIf you're in a hurry for a decent burger + fries, hit up bongo burger. If you're in the mood for a better burger... Well. It's berkeley. What do you expect?? \n\nOnly 2 nomstars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "G3d-xJF_Rt-P_za2eZ1q-Q"}
