As the room was free, I didn't know what to expect and really did not have very high expectations. I arrived and was able to promptly check in. At first glance, this was a nice, clean hotel. I think this hotel has been around for quite a while, so the decor was that of a more old fashion place. In support of my previous statement, the keys to the rooms are actually real keys, made of metal. I didn't know that hotels with actual keys even existed anymore. I proceeded to my room and was pleasantly surprised that my free hotel room was actually quite nice. The bed was big and comfortable. Everything was clean and I wasn't too worried about touching anything or sleeping on the sheets or letting the comforter touch me.  I had to attend a social gathering that was held at the hotel in one of the ballrooms. There was a bar and hors d'oeuvres. The food was pretty good. The room was nice and appropriate for the function.  Upon check out, I thought that I was going to need them to hold onto my belongings until after my interview when I could pick them up. They gladly were willing to keep them for me. Then, I needed my morning caffeine fix. So, I went to the restaurant and asked for coffee. They brought me a cup of coffee with cream and sugar, and when I asked how much it was, they said that it was free. I was surprised because usually free coffee at a hotel comes in the form of a coffee pot in the hotel room or continental breakfast.  If I am ever back in this area and need a place to stay, I would not hesitate to stay here again, even though the room will not be free.", "business_id": "202PfTfJMN_OFJVj9IiICg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-10", "type": "review"}
