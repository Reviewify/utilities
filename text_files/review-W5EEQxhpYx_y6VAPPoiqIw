(for their .99 cent cone that is) i always see this place when i walk around westwood and wanted to at least give it a try. they have alluring banners outside their store advertising their .99 cone deal. what they hey. let's do it. ok so the advertising is a little misleading? i was orig gonna get a dipped cone..but the total would actually be $1.50? but if i got a regular ice cream cone its .99? i ended up getting an ice cream cone w/ pistachio. perrrrty good. nothing beats the price...except maybe diddy riese. but we're not talking cookie sandwiches here, so its all good. my friend tried their dipped cone and she was raving about how good the chocolate was. she was saying how other places use cheap chocolate and its not good but here she was left wanting more. so there u have it. try their \"deal\" either way it's still a deal haha", "business_id": "3-gxNec5AvaOCLhuukbkDA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-29", "type": "review"}
