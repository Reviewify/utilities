The only difficulty is parking. A limited number of spaces are available in the back, and depending on the angle in which the vehicles are parked it can be very challenging to pull in and out of the provided spaces when Zankou is busy. Otherwise, I find Zankou a good place for lunch or dinner. 5 stars.", "business_id": "EMXF_jbhx_GNniMnG0uNVw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-24", "type": "review"}
