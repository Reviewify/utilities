Goody's is probably known for their burritos, which is probably one of my favorite things on campus. The other reviews compared it to Chipotle...well Chipotle is still better and they probably use real meat and better ingredients. But hey, by dining hall standards, Goody's is a good option. I agree with the review that they are overpriced, but you can use dining points. The coffee window is SUPER slow, so never go around 8-9. Goody's also has huge cookies and some vegetarian options, often times more than the actual dining halls. So if you are a UCSD student sick of the typical dining hall food, give Goody's a try. Also, the three stars is based on UCSD dining, never dining in the outside world!", "business_id": "Rk7ktD5511RCkO_BDn7_Sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-04", "type": "review"}
