The only thing I don't like about this place is its location-- being on the far corner of campus makes it a little harder for me to justify actually going. I've tried several of their sandwiches at some point or another and in general, after requesting all of the toppings (all free), I always find them very tasty. That said, the sandwiches are always a mess to eat, so I recommend taking a few napkins and a fork with you before you leave. I've gotten a salad from here before as well as was pretty happy with it-- the only thing I don't like about their salads are that they cost several dollars more than a sandwich. Overall, very solid choice.", "business_id": "Bu9x6JH0H_b7_R_X53glOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-13", "type": "review"}
