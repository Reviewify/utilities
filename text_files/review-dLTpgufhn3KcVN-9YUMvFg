The ambiance is not good.  The high ceiling made conversation in our group impossible because of the ambiant noise of the other diners.   We had to wait for over an hour to get our food.  One person had a chicken salad wrap; when it finally came, it consisted of 10% chicken salad and 90% lettuce.\nI dont know how the Carolina Brewery can be so good in Chapel Hill and so abysmal in its new location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "He5L40pVWlrB1wrgx7LrAg"}
