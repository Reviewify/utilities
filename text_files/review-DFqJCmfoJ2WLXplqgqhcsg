I've gone 2 or 3 times now and haven't been dissapointed.  The fact that you can get a nicely sized pizza for $6 is great, and the fact that for $9 you can have that same pizza but with black truffle cheese is ridiculous!  \n\nIt's like the Subway or Chipotle of pizza, but way better.  because all the ingredients you get to add to your pizza are fresh and not so boring.  Can you add anchovies or roasted garlic to your sub?  Can you ask for arugula on your burrito?  I rest my case\n\nThe pizzas I've had have been great, the only complaint would be the dough wasn't cooked all the way through on my first pizza. . . 3 days after they had opened.  So I don't hold a cook accountable for learning his oven.  The only other gripe I can think of is that the Cheese platter is more of a sides sampler platter since you can ask for anything on the cheese platter to be on your pizza.  I thought that was a little misleading, but their burrata dishes are insanely flavorful.  \n\nHow can you argue with a restaurant who's menu says:\n\"Caesar Salad: Perfect\"?", "type": "review", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw"}
