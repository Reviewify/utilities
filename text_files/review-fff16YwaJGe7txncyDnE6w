Service was just perfect, they really pay arttention and want you to have an enjoyable evening. The meats are INCREDIBLE, but a bit too salty... but thats exactly like they are in Brazil so its 100% authentic. Seasoning is to die for. Salad bar was first rate but a rather limited selection compared to what you'd find in Brazil at a similar place. They bring you a starter appetizer plate with cheese bread puffs, fried bananas and fried polenta, The bananas were PERFECT, crisp and hot, not mushy and greasy, desert before dinner!  I am coming back for sure. It is a bit pricey but well worth it for the quality and prodigious amounts and varieties of meat offered.  Pampas is a gourmet carnivore's dream come true. Try it, you will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-27", "type": "review"}
