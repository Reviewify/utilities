When I walked in, I really felt at home because it reminded me of my childhood and watching my dad fix kabob for my family. The food is amazing. The koobideh is juicy and the chicken is so flavorful. The rice is to die for, too! The owners are very sweet and I can't wait to come back every time I'm in sd. Persian food has always been my comfort food as a little girl, and always will be.", "business_id": "FJkcyU_jT5quVxT_YyxFOQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-14", "type": "review"}
