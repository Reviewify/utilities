I went here with my family and ordered the yellow curry, and it was perfectly spiced and wonderful. I also tried the Pad See Eiw the and the Chow mein entrees, which were also really tasty. My favorite was the curry puff appetizers. They were like a mix between an empenada and a somosa, and they were perfect. I don't know why everybody is commenting on the price, because everything in SLO is expensive. Other Thai places in town charge $13 minimum for an entree. Most dishes at this place were $10 or less. I think Royal Thai has great food, portions, and service for the money.", "business_id": "NJneOd0ovmHiDS0dDLLHsA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-24", "type": "review"}
