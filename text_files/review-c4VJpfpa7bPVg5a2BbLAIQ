I have been coming to this place since it opened and it has consistently gotten worse each time. I would avoid the crab cakes for sure--I got a bad case of food poisoning from them. My last experience was not as dramatic but convinced me that I need to find a better place when in the Palo Alto area. I ordered soup and salad, and requested it be served as an entree. The \"farm lettuces\" was a past its prime red lettuce that was overdressed in oil, and it appeared it had been sitting for a while. The corn soup was lukewarm and too sweet--as if sugar had been added. My guess is that even though requested as an entree, it was prepared as an appetizer and left to sit while the other entrees were prepared. I had planned on eating some of my husband's roast chicken, but it was too undercooked for my tastes--one piece was pink and dripping blood. My son's pricey hamburger was in his words, \"forgettable.\" Then it came time for dessert. My son ordered mixed berries with strawbery sorbet. The sorbet was fine, the mixed berries, the first item listed, were actually three underipe blackberries, more of a garnish than part of the dessert. My panna cotta was tasty, but runny. My husband ordered coffee with dessert, but it was not served until several minutes after dessert was finished, so he ended up gulping it while the rest of us waited to leave. They insist on having flowers with mostly eucalyptus leaves added in, which are highly allergenic for many people. It seems they have a huge turnover, every time I have been, I notice an entire new set of waiters, even if in the same time frame as the previous visit. What seemed to be a promising place for fresh, sustainable food has become an expensive disappointment.", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-08-17", "type": "review"}
