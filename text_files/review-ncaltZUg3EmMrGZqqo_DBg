As someone else mentioned, it is tucked away in a little cove on Telegraph. And yes, every time I go, there aren't many people who happen to be there. However, their food is AWESOME!!! I like their version of fried tempura because it's crunchier than regular tempura and I love the soy sauce-based dip they give you. In fact, I don't think I've ever had anything there I didn't like. Their side dishes are tasty and generous. Plus, their dishes (especially the stuff that comes on the iron plates) are fantastic. I'm all for supporting small, local businesses. This one looks like it's family-run because I've never seen more than 2-3 people work there (and it's always the same people). This is one restaurant that I hope is around for a long time.  Sad story: Unfortunately, during one of my visits, my friend and I left, leaving the tip on the table. (Since it's only a couple of people working, the cash sometimes stays on the table for a while, because they workers are busy handling multiple things.) As we stood outside the door, two teenage girls walked in, took the tip and ran out. I was really disappointed because small mom-and-pop places don't deserve that kind of treatment. Unfortunately, we couldn't replace the tip because we had no more cash on us. On our next outing at Koryo, we double tipped them. Lesson learned... make sure to hand them the tip tray so that they get their fair share.", "business_id": "we3YxbueOBb0f-m7ekYk2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-11-28", "type": "review"}
