Their fruit is always the best around and their prices are actually better than Harris Teeter down the street. Their fresh made sandwiches are super delicious and so are their fresh baked breads (seeded ciabatta and sourdough are my favorites). The staff are really friendly and it's great to sit out in the front lawn area and just relax. I hope Durham brings back their Co-op and it is just as good as (since it would be nearly impossible to be better than) the Weaver Street Market!", "business_id": "TKkKRrMcP0R_VPO8QKR7YQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-08", "type": "review"}
