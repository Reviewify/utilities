I love the organic focus of the menu as well. The space is clean, modern, well-lit, with plenty of tables and chairs. Great place for a casual meal, or for take out pizza. I don't recommend take-out of anything besides the pizza...will seriously detract from the fresh taste/texture of the food. What is awesome: Gnocchi: pillows of delicate, carby-deliciousness...browned butter, whisp of garlic, fresh sage. Seriously the best Gnocchi I've ever had...do NOT get with the pesto, it's far too heavy. Spaghetti Alfredo with ham and mushrooms. Creamy, salty, hearty, earthy. Perfect for a fall dinner with a side-salad. Sausage and Rapini Pizza..I love the combo of slightly-bitter greens with rich sausage flavor. Arugula and Proscuitto pizza: the peppery greens, liberal-lashings of olive oil, the salty proscuitto, the sharp peccorino...heavenly!  Truffle Pizza: Earthy, cheesy, melt-in-your-mouth good. Sex on dough. Calzone: All are fantastic, the dough is very light and puffy, almost like a doughnut in texture. Mmmmmmm. The sweet calzone makes for a memorable dessert (split between 2-3 people as it is RICH). What I don't like: Any of the vegan desserts...(I'm not a vegan, so perhaps I shouldn't judge). Service is SLOW...do not come in if you're in a hurry/want it in a NYC Minute - but hardly grounds to label the restaurant with 1 star *Raised Eyebrow*", "business_id": "jTPr0dFk2JgGYdDiIGro3Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-18", "type": "review"}
