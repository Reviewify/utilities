I love the organic focus of the menu as well. The space is clean, modern, well-lit, with plenty of tables and chairs. Great place for a casual meal, or for take out pizza. I don't recommend take-out of anything besides the pizza...will seriously detract from the fresh taste/texture of the food.\n\nWhat is awesome:\n\nGnocchi: pillows of delicate, carby-deliciousness...browned butter, whisp of garlic, fresh sage. Seriously the best Gnocchi I've ever had...do NOT get with the pesto, it's far too heavy.\n\nSpaghetti Alfredo with ham and mushrooms. Creamy, salty, hearty, earthy. Perfect for a fall dinner with a side-salad.\n\nSausage and Rapini Pizza..I love the combo of slightly-bitter greens with rich sausage flavor.\n\nArugula and Proscuitto pizza: the peppery greens, liberal-lashings of olive oil, the salty proscuitto, the sharp peccorino...heavenly! \n\nTruffle Pizza: Earthy, cheesy, melt-in-your-mouth good. Sex on dough.\n\nCalzone: All are fantastic, the dough is very light and puffy, almost like a doughnut in texture. Mmmmmmm. The sweet calzone makes for a memorable dessert (split between 2-3 people as it is RICH).\n\nWhat I don't like:\nAny of the vegan desserts...(I'm not a vegan, so perhaps I shouldn't judge).\n\nService is SLOW...do not come in if you're in a hurry/want it in a NYC Minute - but hardly grounds to label the restaurant with 1 star *Raised Eyebrow*", "type": "review", "business_id": "jTPr0dFk2JgGYdDiIGro3Q"}
