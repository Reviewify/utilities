I rate this place minus the three screaming kids and the constant crop duster next to us, to be fair. Our server was excellent. She gave great service and helped suggest dessert. We got the Wed night date special that includes a trip to the grill for two people, an app and a dessert for $28. Not too bad for all of that food. However, when got to the grill we noticed there were no bean sprouts! What? Also, the meat looked a little shady but when our food arrived at the table it was better than expected but still average. They do have 3 different gluten free sauces that they note on the menu. Hooray! We had calamari for an app which I did sneak a piece of and it was tasty. The meat was a little on the \"rubber\" side but at least the batter was light. For dessert we had B52 cheesecake which I also snuck a bite of. The server couldn't even swing by to ask how it was before our party of three inhaled the whole slice. So yea, it was good. The restaurant wasn't busy and we intentionally went in the middle of the week so we could avoid the long grill lines. I am satisfied with the service and feel indifferent about the food but overall it was a 2.5 experience and I had a drink so I'll be kind and round to 3 stars. I'm not inclined to hurry back but I would visit again as long as the screaming babies and crop dusters aren't in site when I walk in the front door.", "business_id": "3ejW1TGlpSVhaspKversrw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-01", "type": "review"}
