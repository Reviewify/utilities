Ramen doesn't seem to be a big thing in Seattle (which is surprising because the Japanese population seems to be big here) and there aren't many shops that specialize in ramen. So when I heard about this ramen place, I was really excited to try it.  When my bowl of ramen arrived, I was disappointed with the presentation and even more disappointed with the noodles and the broth.   Don't think think I will be coming back.", "business_id": "HSvxkRy8GQTZX56OFB4L-g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-09-03", "type": "review"}
