So when I heard about this ramen place, I was really excited to try it. \n\nWhen my bowl of ramen arrived, I was disappointed with the presentation and even more disappointed with the noodles and the broth.  \n\nDon't think think I will be coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HSvxkRy8GQTZX56OFB4L-g"}
