However, relative to the other sushi restaurants I have been to..they still put too much rice in the rolls and sushi. The fish quality and the cut of fish was okay. The rolls did not impressed me but the blue crab roll is worth a try--if you like the taste of seafood. I still prefer the sushi pieces over the roll. Service was okay. Music is too loud--sounds like I am at the club than a restaurant. Parking: Try Broxton parking lot (free before 6pm).", "business_id": "iQ3fajcAmbQrwPfg-AoJTA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-30", "type": "review"}
