As a female, I HATE dealing with mechanics and car sales people (usually men). I brought in my 2004 Honda and told him what I needed: check on panel lights, change oil and an inspection. He told me up front he does not do inspections, but offered to take my car down the street to another shop that did! WHAT A TIME SAVER! That alone earned him 5 stars. He called back later to say that he had changed the oil and secured the inspection, but that the dealer would have to fix the panel lights (uggg). I told him I would be in later to pick up my car, but got caught up at work (and lost track of time). He called at 5:30 pm (when he closes) to check if I was still coming because he was willing to wait! What a guy! I will never take my car to another place as long as I live in Boston (except to the dealer to fix the panel light...ugggg).", "business_id": "pMEabXhcC43f5YbRwtn4DA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-11", "type": "review"}
