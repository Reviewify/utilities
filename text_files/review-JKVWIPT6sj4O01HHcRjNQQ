Perhaps I had high expectations but, I was not overwhelmed.\n\nThe falafel had good flavor, although maybe a bit more citrus in that tahini sauce than I would expect.  The hot sauce added a small amount of bite which was nice.\n\nMy main criticism is that the falafel wrap was cold throughout and the pita was a bit on the dry side.  I personally perfer warm to hot falafel wraps with a nice soft pita.   \n\nI plan on a re-visit shortly to see if this was a one time issue with hopes of an improvement.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKirSxY1-ScGEzQjfYSI2A"}
