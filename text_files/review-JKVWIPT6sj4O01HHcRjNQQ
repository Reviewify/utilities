Perhaps I had high expectations but, I was not overwhelmed. The falafel had good flavor, although maybe a bit more citrus in that tahini sauce than I would expect. The hot sauce added a small amount of bite which was nice. My main criticism is that the falafel wrap was cold throughout and the pita was a bit on the dry side. I personally perfer warm to hot falafel wraps with a nice soft pita. I plan on a re-visit shortly to see if this was a one time issue with hopes of an improvement.", "business_id": "rKirSxY1-ScGEzQjfYSI2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-28", "type": "review"}
