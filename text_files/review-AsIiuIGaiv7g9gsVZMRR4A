This place has kept me awake through some long days and nights of classes and events on campus.  The Coffee Bar faces the street so there is outdoor seating and windows in the place.  One of the walls has a couple of flat screen tvs...most patrons don't pay much attention to them, but they add to the ambiance.  The Coffee Bar serves Starbucks coffee (House Blend) and make standard espresso drinks and frappuccinos.  They don't have a huge selection of syrups (I really like sugar-free hazelnut syrup but they don't have it), and most of the pastries and sandwiches are provided by the University's caterers (which are meh).  I like that they have a punch card, though, so every 11th drink is free!  I also like that it's located in the Stamp Student Union, but it's not open very late on the weekends - boo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cNq0UgS7biGPSx39cxWd-Q"}
