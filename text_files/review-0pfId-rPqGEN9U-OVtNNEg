The guy was really confounded by this because the amount of cake left was kind of small (but not small enough to be just one slice, more like 1.7522 slices). He was gonna cut a slice and then cut it in half, but that seemed too small so he decided to cut the remaining cake in half and then sell both pieces to us as just slice. What a nice dude!", "business_id": "vONGfjuEYWtzvReseHJLrw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-18", "type": "review"}
