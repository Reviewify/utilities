We went on Wednesday and it was warm enough that the front door was propped open and the odors wafting from the kitchen welcomed us in. \n\nBut the smell was better than the taste. I really wanted a falafel sandwich as did my wife who was talked into ordering a falafel platter. The sandwich was not wrapped in a traditional pita - something I could deal with, just disappointed. Unfortunately the sandwich included olives that just overpowered the flavor of anything else. My wife's platter was beautifully presented and offered a sampling of just about everything they offer I think - but in the end all you could taste was garlic. \n\nMy sons each ordered a chicken gyro - the chicken seemed to be a roasted chicken that had been hand sliced. There was a sauce, but more mayonnaise than tzatziki. \n\n$40 for lunch for four (three waters and one Pepsi) seemed like a lot. \n\nWe won't be going back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C1OLx5RjPgBM4j9q7sg12Q"}
