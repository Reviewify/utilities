The lunch specials are a good deal - your choice of entree with a side of rice for $7-9. They'll have the daily specials written on a board when you walk in. It's true what everyone says - the garlic-pepper pork is simply amazing. So tasty! It hasn't changed in 9 years, still the best item on the menu. The pineapple prawns dish is also delicious. A good blend of spicy and sweet and generous with the prawns. Recently I tried the chicken noodle soup, which was ok, but I wouldn't get it again. The yellow curry broth was too rich for me, and it had a lot of tofu, but very little chicken. If I'm here with my brother, he will always order the crispy calamari appetizer. I'm not a fan of calamari, but these are very good.", "business_id": "tR7wIIvJsLqI8keoLf8tpg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-10", "type": "review"}
