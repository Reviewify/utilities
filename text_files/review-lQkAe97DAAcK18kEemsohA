I'm a huge fan of the Blackberry Mojito, Miso Soup, and Endamame. The portions are just right and the flavors are exquisite.  I really like the atmosphere. It's major eye candy. That calming wall of trickling water is very soothing.  Plus the people are helpful and polite. I definitely can wind down here  after a hard day. There's metered parking out front.  If you prefer free like me, there's a parking garage around the corner. :-)", "business_id": "KKB3Z3bLDTNY2hBFzuRNEg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-26", "type": "review"}
