I'm a huge fan of the Blackberry Mojito, Miso Soup, and Endamame. The portions are just right and the flavors are exquisite. \n\nI really like the atmosphere. It's major eye candy. That calming wall of trickling water is very soothing.  Plus the people are helpful and polite. I definitely can wind down here  after a hard day.\n\nThere's metered parking out front.  If you prefer free like me, there's a parking garage around the corner. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "KKB3Z3bLDTNY2hBFzuRNEg"}
