The first time was in a large group--so we were in the back room. Getting to the back room is like being in that Goodfellas scene where they go through the kitchen saying \"how ya doin'\" to all the kitchen staff. Could be just me, but I thought that was pretty cool. I don't remember the food as much as the atmosphere, which I was very pleased with. The second time I went I ordered Veal in the main room and enjoyed it from start to finish--right down to the side veggies. Our wait staff was on point and very helpful. Overall, I've enjoyed my experiences here and will probably go back.", "business_id": "qfNX18O5FdknoUjfI0n-fQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-26", "type": "review"}
