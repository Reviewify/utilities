The food is great and you get big portions, and I hardly ever feel obligated to leave a tip (though I always do). You pay for your food before you eat it and you serve yourself water. This isn't a waiter type restaurant. \n\nI love the nachos and the lasagna and the tofu burritos. I am planning a trip to SLO in the near future and I will definitely stop by.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZRm8fSEBn8DsSLD4o7T4hQ"}
