I come here occasionally with my family usually for lunch or dinner and I have never been disappointed at all. To be honest, I've never tried their pastrami sandwiches. I usually get their ham & swiss cold subs, but the next time I go, I'm gonna try their pastrami sandwich. I also love how big the portions are for their small order of fries. At other fast food places, it would be considered a large! But yeah, I love this place!! They also have endless supply of condiments and disposable plates that I always grab.", "business_id": "W0Ralo_CGj0XeROjHhx4Pw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-21", "type": "review"}
