Right next to USC and the Exposition Park rose garden.  Students and tourists alike can access these destinations through public transit. Yay for less congestion and improved public transportation in LA County! =) I went during the new Expo line's opening day and noticed that the platforms are long and relatively wide. This station looks like it can accomodate a lot of people. Also, there is still a good amount of lanes on either side of the station for cars to travel through on the street. The only thing you have to be careful of is crossing the train tracks to get to the other side. But the good thing is that these is adequate signage, lights and ample line of sight to see approaching trains coming.", "business_id": "72hMifQWaKTNTNDxMG7tOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-09", "type": "review"}
