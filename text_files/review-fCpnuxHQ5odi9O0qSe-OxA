If you're a vegan, you would enjoy this place. If you're a vegetarian, you would enjoy this place. And if you're one who is not adventurous and non-vegan, you will still get hooked.  The location is convenient, the staff is friendly, and the food is just extraordinary. Eating this food not only makes me feel good about myself, but it actually tastes good. Not just that substitute meat good, but good quality. You would not expect vegan food to taste, you know....real. Once you get in, especially on a scorching hot day, take advantage of the unlimited refreshing drinks they have. I could not stop drinking the watermelon fresca; I must have peed out a whole gallon that day. The pulp and true flavor of watermelon hits your tongue and you instantly get transported to nirvana. It's just that dang tasty.  It was a Friday, and because I wanted to get the sides, I decided on the special: Twister wrap with sweet potatoes fries. I am obsessed with sweet potato fries, and Native Foods has one of the best. They are thinly cut and enough crisp on the outside  and inside. The wrap itself tasted like a bacon chicken wrap. It came in huge portions! Talk about a deal. I loved the wrap and the sauce it had on the side. I would definitely come back for a vegan fixing.", "business_id": "gcf4bQVbiOqglEmYBfbpwQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-12", "type": "review"}
