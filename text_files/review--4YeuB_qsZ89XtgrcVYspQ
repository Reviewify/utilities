After 30 minutes late, I called and asked if they would still be coming. Richard told me that he was too far away and wasn't going to show up. No-show and not even calling ahead to cancel the appointment? Completely unprofessional.", "business_id": "cBejqMu3nxm-YHOEn-DN3A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-19", "type": "review"}
