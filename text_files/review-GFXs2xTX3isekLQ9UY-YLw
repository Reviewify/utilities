After a while, you get tired of the same sort of food, or nearby Denny's. Great to hang out at nights on the patio. I wish there was more places like that around the campus, that would definitely revive the neighborhood and give more options and hang out places. Oh, and the food is really good too!", "business_id": "xuRWwbM-qxSbDSv6Ph35Eg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-09-07", "type": "review"}
