This place has so much attraction that foreigners, tourists, international students, and more constantly bring traffic to the campus as well as the town. Naturally a college town, Berkeley sells itself as a brand; there are an enormous amount of different Cal gear, memorabilia, apparel, and souvenirs shops from the intersection of Bancroft and Telegraph and spread throughout. Therefore, finding cheap Cal gear became a priority of mine. Although the prices in T-Shirt Orgy-Bear Basics are relatively similar to Neds and Bancroft Clothing, they have most of the Cal gear I need. Their store consist of 3 floors. The top floor has women's clothing. The middle floor, which is where customers enter from, is where they sell Cal Gear. Lastly, the bottom floor is the T-shirt Orgy floor, with many different t-shirts from Political to music, to celebrities, to cartoons, you name it and they will mostly have it. \n\n   The Cal Gear floor have different types of sweatshirts at good prices. The prices are relative to their quality; ie, a $20 hoodie will be then and not that comfy versus a $60 jansport branded hoodie with great quality and cotton. Same goes for the shirts; they have cal images and logos on brand shirts from Gildan to American Apparel. In terms of variety of styles and different logos, Bear Basics gets the job done. Prices may varies to their sales and the quality of the gear being sold- however, they offer a variety to appeal to the customer's taste. They also sell New Era Cal caps with different styles and logos- so many that it has its own wall! This is probably one of the places I stop by when I buy souvenirs for family members, friends, and relatives.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M72BkiwGCnNzprwFwJSazQ"}
