They give you so many options to pick and choose from to create your own burger (meats, buns, sauces, toppings, cheeses, etc...), as well as their own burger creations in case the options become too overwhelming. My burger came out hot, greasy and oozing with melted cheese *ahhhh* that's the best kind of burger! \n\nThe location was really nice and just a hop, skip and jump away from Fenway Park.  I would definitely eat here again.\n\n - Brownie Out!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PPQgcw0WKdZ6nznkPLgX5Q"}
