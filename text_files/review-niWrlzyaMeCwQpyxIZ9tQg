My favoriteeee!! I can taste the grilled corn, mayo, imitation crab meat, and eggplant (yes, eggplant!)!\n\nSteak Robata\n- Second favorite! Moist and flavorful! 3~4 roasted pieces of meat poked into a skewer.\n\nRolls\n- CHEAP.\n- All the rolls taste like any other place. Nothing special other than the price.\n- Too much rice, too little fish. The roll radius has been decreasing since Yamato revamped their menu couple years ago! \n- Fish too old. Usually when I order rolls w/ raw fish, the fish is too soft and room temperature. Gross.\n\nHowever, the decor is beautiful. This building used to be a bank and the small teller stations have been converted into little sushi rooms or storage. There are many tables good for groups as well! You can also ask for extra spicy mayo for no charge!\n\nFINAL VERDICT\nGreat place if I'm low on cash while craving sushi and eating with a lot of friends. Otherwise, eat sushi else where.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg"}
