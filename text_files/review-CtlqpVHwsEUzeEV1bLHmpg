It's one of the coffee shops where employees know their roasts well. I came in with an intent of buying quickly a pound of beans to brew myself at work. The cute, young lady who helped me was very knowledgeable of their offerings and pointed out several roasts that satisfied my criteria. They roast on the premises, in small batches. You can actually see the roaster and equipment - what an authentic feel. You can get their popular blends super-fresh, literally within several hours from roasting. The rarer beans are available with a roast date of 3-4 days back - very fresh as well, I'd say optimal. I bought a couple of South American roasts and brewed soon after to prove their freshness. The bloom was unbelievable and the result was fantastic in both an Aeropress and a stovetop moka pot. You can get half pound quantities as well if you enjoy experimenting with coffee. When you buy a pound, you get a free cup of coffee. You can get a client card as well and get 11th pound free, if you're into making coffee on your own. The interior has a rustic and artsy feel, with lots of young people in, even at odd hours (i.e. Sunday night). I love their hours too - open till 11. In short, this is a supply gem for a coffee connoisseur.", "business_id": "otrAgBvYPhpIpTezkxlebQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-24", "type": "review"}
