Great place to get a pair of shoes if you're a stripper. Or if you like converse. The sale section is hit-or-miss. I've gotten some cool T-shirts there before, but I've also seen grossly overpriced items. They are a decent place to get Halloween costumes. Good variety. A tad overpriced, but what do you expect when you're Halloween costume shopping during Halloween? They are GREAT for Halloween accessories though, especially if you plan on being slutty (insert some random occupation or fairy tale character here).", "business_id": "dM_8JMbohCb8YYP1UlFPng", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-11", "type": "review"}
