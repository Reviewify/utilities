It's a little crowded but the beer selection (100 different varieties) is the best virtually anywhere. The half price menu starts at 11, so you can go there get dinner and drinks with some friends and it's a good night. \nThe food is always excellent, and after 11 a good value. \nThe service is always good. \nI love the ambiance of the place, but I could see how people could find it irritating. It's loud (particularly when there is live music) and it is crowded. However in my four years going to fuel this never once dissuaded me, because the half priced menu is just too good and trying the new beers is just too much fun.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ehaoreB8IzKY8KvRGqxcUA"}
