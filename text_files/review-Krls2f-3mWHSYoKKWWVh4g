If you want cheap food, Hawaiian fusion, and quick on the go, then this place is right for you! Really recommend the mixed combination with CHICKEN and BEEF. I've tried their spam musubis which are satisfying. Everytime I went, the tables and seats seemed to be occupied during PRIME time! This is a popular lunch/dinner for working associates and college students! I'd definitely come here if I'm having that crave or urge for some Hawaiian food. Just don't come to this restaurant with high expectations. This is your traditional quick grab and go food place!", "business_id": "BKlN_RDN6vzQQ_bg4n4R6Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-14", "type": "review"}
