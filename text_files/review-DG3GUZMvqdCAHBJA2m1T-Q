We arrived in full lunch crowd mode around 1:30. Parking was tight but we ended up in front. At first glance, we thought we had made a mistake as the line was well out the door. I told my son to be patient but the line was CRAWLING. I put this more on the customers indecision as I do the guys behind the counter. However, they could benefit from a more efficient space with two check out areas, like the much larger sister location. I ordered the stuffed baked potato with chopped brisket ($6.95). I added their jalapeno pinots for $1.95. While a good value, they were stingy with the meat on the spud. My son ordered a sliced BBQ sandwich with the potato salad and Austin baked beans. We sat outside in the nice weather (my son still thinks its weird to sit with strangers on a picnic bench). The potato was consistently good and stuffed with butter, sour cream and cheese it was. The pintos never dissapoint. My son devoured the sandwich and potato salad but didnt like the way the baked beans were prepared with some kind of brown sugar/cinnnamom and chunks of potato in them. This location is charming but they have certainly outgrown the inside and parking SUCKS. I kissed one of their cement poles trying to get out. Lunch did the trick but I still favor the other locations including the one near Cypress on 290.", "business_id": "F-CnLwWvidsZqR9pLUrcBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-02", "type": "review"}
