Great spot for group lunches in between class (I have class all day Saturdays). The price is right. Conveniently located near parking structure 32. THE GRUB:  The food is great. High level of variety on the menu -- good thai selections in the realm of curry, rice, noodles, and other. THE DOWN SIDE: Only negative - service is often slow.  Bank on raising your hand for attention at least once -- mostly likely when you're trying to get the check.", "business_id": "1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}
