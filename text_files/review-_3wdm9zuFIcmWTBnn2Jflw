I've been to a few Moroccan restaurants across the country and this has by far been the best yet. The atmosphere has a very authentic feel complete with some mesmerizing belly dancing and piped in Moroccan music ( at a slightly piercing volume until you get used to it). The front right side of the restaurant is a little bright for my liking, so I asked to be moved to a table near the bar (much more cozy, yet only 5 feet away). We started with the baked goat cheese (scrumpt-didilly-licious!), then split had the Lamb and Kafka kabobs and the Vegetable Tagine. Comforting food. Too much quantity for two people, but we managed to just about wipe the plates clean anyway.", "business_id": "5N_gm8wchfQmDvQFNeAtCA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-11", "type": "review"}
