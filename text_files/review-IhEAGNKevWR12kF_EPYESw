I had a hot pot and my husband had the squid, which was in a stir fry with a lot of hot sauce (not really hot though), and assorted veggies and stuff. The banchan were all good and it was all so much food for such a reasonable price.\n\nAs everyone else says, it's really small and you have to come at weird hours to get a table. But even at weird hours be careful. We were lucky. We got there at 1:15 or so and there were a couple of tables open. But by 2:00 people were waiting outside.\n\nThe service was on par with other Korean restaurants I've been to in Seattle- meaning that everyone does their job but no one really smiles or tries to make small talk with customers, and you have to ask for more water or anything else you might need aside from your initial order.\n\nAll in all, a great place. It might actually be the best thing about the U District.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFzF3dcRKGcziTf4KT0Skw"}
