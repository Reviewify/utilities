We have Washington state IDs and were prompted to show them to the cashier, who also happens to be the owner.  This was no surprise; of course, she'd want to check our IDs before letting us purchase alcohol.  However, she opened up a book that shows pictures of state IDs to verify our ID, and apparently our two Washington state IDs did not match the ID images she had in her book, and she refused to let us purchase the champagne.  While I appreciate her thoroughness, I am completely appalled that she would not let a married couple in our late twenties with multiple credit cards and Harvard IDs purchase champagne.  Our Washington IDs are from July 2010; we have no idea why they don't match the picture in her book, but clearly her book is outdated.  And, if we really had fake IDs, wouldn't we take even more care to make sure our IDs match pictures in a book used to check for fake IDs? \n\nI will never shop at Cardullo's ever again as a result of this humiliating and atrocious service.  Big mistake.  HUGE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "57GCzasopXE1-t2DuQ4Lzg"}
