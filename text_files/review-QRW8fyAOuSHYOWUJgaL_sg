I also like their wraps, salads and cocktails. Although I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, I can't really say anything bad about the place. The servers are always friendly, its always clean and they run good daily specials on wings and such.", "business_id": "vdaBA6_jZCQeMkHqCpxJ2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-29", "type": "review"}
