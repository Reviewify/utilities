Besides the fact that it was completely empty, (it turns out they have a two hour break between 3 and 5, when they close the restaurant), the menu doesn't seem to have a whole lot on it. But I am so glad I didn't walk away right then and there. My brother and I shared the Wild Mushroom pizza, and I have to say, I may never eat pizza anywhere else again. We also tried the Quinoa Sushi, which wasn't half bad. I cannot begin to describe how good it was. And for dessert we tried the Carrot Cake. Again, I'm not a fan of carrot cake; in fact, I'd never had it before. But this little piece of heaven was delicious. I think they put some sort of spice in it, but it had an almost pumpkin pie undertone to it. And the fact that all this amazing food is good for you, too, just makes it that much more worth eating. At the very least, you won't feel bloated with guilt and self-loathing after you've eating it.", "business_id": "-Rk11WNVhdTin7oiLV1dVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-30", "type": "review"}
