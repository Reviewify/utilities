My husband and I have been there three times now, and we love it. We usually do the 1/2 foot and 1/2 body massage. Nicely appointed, very clean, and terrific prices. Husband tried acupuncture tonight after his massage, and seems to be having good results. One of the massage therapists, her name sounds like Ree Mee, was intuitive and strong. Speak up if you are modest. Background noise can be a little distracting when in the massage room, but it's not awful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7VWFlLtQwQIzMRm3fmaEXA"}
