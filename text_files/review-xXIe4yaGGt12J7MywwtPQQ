Eating gluten-free is not cheap or easy, but for many of us, it is absolutely necessary.  \nThere is a lot of selection and here you don't have to read labels because everything is gluten-free.  \nThe one thing that really bothers me is that when you enter the store, no one EVER asks if you need help.  You're on your own unless YOU ask.  (And I've been shopping there for a couple of years.)  They want you to bring your own bag and that's OK with me. But without any outreach to customers in the store, why not have the option of DIY checkout and offer a discount to customers who choose to do that?", "type": "review", "business_id": "GfU3xrGC86YVl2NSxjcibg"}
