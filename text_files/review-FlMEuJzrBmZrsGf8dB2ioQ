I am totally in love with this place !! I love that it's an outdoor mall and that it's super clean !! It's also very pretty with lots of beautiful flowers and plants . Love that the weather is nice here . There's a good amount of stores at this outdoor mall and all the stores are the nicer high-end stores . There's a few stores here which sell very unique clothing and merchandise . There is a private parking lot with a good amount of parking spaces . I would love to shop here on a nice , sunny day ! The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like they are lacking one thing ... food ! They really need a better and bigger selection of places to eat . I came here around 3 and most of the food places here are closed from 2:30 - 5 or 5:30 . Other than that , I will probably be back . Stanford Shopping Center definitely beats going to other malls in the bay area ...", "type": "review", "business_id": "2oFme3IiUSSi0PdAJNBxwg"}
