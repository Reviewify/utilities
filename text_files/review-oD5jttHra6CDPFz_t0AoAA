My first EDC experience was in 2006; my only wish is to have had an earlier start.  I do miss those lesser ones held in the streets of downtown LA years back - there's something special about partying under darkened skies amongst those majestic skyscrapers.  LA Coliseum and fairground has been EDC's home for the past half decade, and the property certainly does the event justice. The line up is always sick, and the overall event production (stages, sound, lighting, fireworks, art/show pieces, vendors, carnival rides, acts) is over the top and get progressively insane as years progress. 180,000 visitors (in the 2010 EDC) can't be wrong! I love you, Insomiac.", "business_id": "YMeWjOd1svHDGdDCKoiGgg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-11", "type": "review"}
