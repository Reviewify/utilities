Came here today and tried their bibimbap w/beef. Serving was pretty big, with lots of veggies and meat on top. Not crazy about the lettuce in there but I just got that out of the way first. After a while I realized that it was pretty oily...which I'm not really used to in bibimbap. My friend got kimchi fried rice...I think I've had better kimchi fried rice in a Taiwanese restaurant...but the accompanying meat was good [chicken]...not too dry :) At $6.50 after tax, it wasn't a steal, but was on par with other campus places. My search for decent bibimbap in the area goes on!", "business_id": "4D7IdtyRjH8qxcsHaz1-GA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-30", "type": "review"}
