Came here today and tried their bibimbap w/beef.  \nServing was pretty big, with lots of veggies and meat on top.  Not crazy about the lettuce in there but I just got that out of the way first.  After a while I realized that it was pretty oily...which I'm not really used to in bibimbap.  \nMy friend got kimchi fried rice...I think I've had better kimchi fried rice in a Taiwanese restaurant...but the accompanying meat was good [chicken]...not too dry :)\nAt $6.50 after tax, it wasn't a steal, but was on par with other campus places.  \nMy search for decent bibimbap in the area goes on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4D7IdtyRjH8qxcsHaz1-GA"}
