I got the farmers omlette and absolutely satisfied with it, love the bread, lettuce that comes with it. It didn't take my boyfriend a second to set his mind on a burger when he saw one being carried to somebody else! It was very delicious. Their mimosas do not bite at all and very refreshing. And the coffee, just perfect...People complaining about the slow service: This food just can't be prepared in 10 minutes! It is really high quality. They could improve on their mixed berry jam, this one was way too sweet and a larger amount would be more appropriate for the amount of bread that is served with it. \n\nI am definitely interested in trying it for a dinner too.\n\n********Edition, April14 2008*********\n\nGood food but really if you wait FOREVER (Now, I am also complaining). I asked one of our servers today if the kitchen was backed up, he said no...Well, then why this wait? Do you have a slow cook? Or do the waiters work slowly?I don't understand why it is SO SLOW...I know that it can not be prepared in 10 minutes as I mentioned earlier, but it shouldn't take half an hour just to get even a dessert...", "type": "review", "business_id": "PmCzpKyHhBN1RoTEv6Edag"}
