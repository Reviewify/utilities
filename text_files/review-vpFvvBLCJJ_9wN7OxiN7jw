I got Original with Raspberries that were big but not local. I got it with the mini recees that were too small to taste. $5 and I didn't even get that special feeling.\n\nI wanted to stop here because I overhead at Harvard Book Store that this stuff was delicious. Oh yuppies, with their politically correct desserts! I guess BerryLine is delicious if you like frozen yogurt! \n\nI want to prolong summer feelings by eating Icecream; not sorbet, not yogurt, icecream.\n\nI recommend B-lining it to the creme of the crop.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HMB84WmKjl8n_x12SbiayQ"}
