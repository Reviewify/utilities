If you are in the Square, and are not square, go straight to Bartley's Burger for a quality shake or Herrell's or Christy's for fresh ice cream.  Truth is, it is fresh yogurt  (and I actually love real yogurt-a la Brown Cow), but Berry Line is just not my cup of fat. I got Original with Raspberries that were big but not local. I got it with the mini recees that were too small to taste. $5 and I didn't even get that special feeling. I wanted to stop here because I overhead at Harvard Book Store that this stuff was delicious. Oh yuppies, with their politically correct desserts! I guess BerryLine is delicious if you like frozen yogurt!  I want to prolong summer feelings by eating Icecream; not sorbet, not yogurt, icecream. I recommend B-lining it to the creme of the crop.", "business_id": "HMB84WmKjl8n_x12SbiayQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-09-15", "type": "review"}
