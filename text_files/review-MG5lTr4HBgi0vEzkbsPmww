Amara is a small studio with a friendly community and a variety of reasonably-priced classes (hatha, ashtanga, yin, etc). Personally, I have learned an immense amount from Linda Lehovec's wonderful alignment-focused classes, but there's many options and great, caring teachers. Special classes, art events, and workshops (for example, partner yoga and yoga 101) rotate through the schedule, too.\n\nI would love to see a greater variety of morning classes, but that is my only (small!) complaint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TWcilg9o0HMAnXvMNwfXRg"}
