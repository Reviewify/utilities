We walked around area and she mentioned a section called, \"Asian Ghetto.\"  At first I couldn't stop laughing at the strange reference but she assured me that there's a lot of good places to eat in there.  So, we decided to check it out.  The small strip consists of various Asian foods as well as the random donut, Greek, & Italian restaurants.  The fact that all the selections looked like local mom & pop shops really hit home.   While waiting for some friends to come meet up for dinner, I couldn't help but notice the pictures in front of Bear's Ramen House.  My friend told me that they're famous for their Kimchi Fried Rice.  Intrigued, my friends and I all ordered the fried rice (without the butter).  So good!!  The flavor was just right-not too salty, spicy, or oily (well, maybe just a tad).  If you're nostalgic for some home cooked food, come satisfy your tummy with this amazing goodness!  Plus, the friendly lady their smiles so much, it makes you feel like you're right in your own mama's kitchen (: This place, as well as all the other eateries on Telegraph, makes me jealous that I didn't have all this accessible to me when I was in college :(", "business_id": "9N684D-RFrQC0V4K0XvdxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-17", "type": "review"}
