The service was very good, but that could have been because one member of our party worked there part-time. The pizza came out tremendously fast - almost suspiciously fast. It wasn't precut, so we basically had to rip the flatbread apart with our bare hands like cavemen. The toppings were super tasty and the waitress was on top of our drink situation all night. The atmosphere was a mix - people dressed up and down - but everyone seemed pretty laid-back and chill. Overall, pretty nondescript - not overly good, and not overly bad. I'm actually surprised at how little I can possibly have to write about the place, but that about sums it up.", "business_id": "M487o17d25K9Jnrf-bKFQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-11", "type": "review"}
