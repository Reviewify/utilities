It's reasonably priced, good portions and very good (their soups and the wings are great). But. Oh wow. The service. Awful. Three times my family and I have tried and we are through. There is a waitress and a waiter/bartender and there are way too many customers for them to handle. You wait and you wait and you wait. . The lazy owner/manager - who, maybe picks up a dish once in awhile but basically just hangs out, needs to hire more help, because those two run around like crazy, but it's not enough. I don't LIKE going to Applebees and Red Robin when there is good cheap food in the same neighborhood locally owned, but 2 hours for burgers and wings with kids is too damned long.", "business_id": "0pPsnqxBAj7UGjGRL-QJ1A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-04", "type": "review"}
