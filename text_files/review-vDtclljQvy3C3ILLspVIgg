The flavors in the curry will keep you smiling and the roti is uber crispy. It is the best thing on Penang's (yes, at its many locations) menu! As others have noticed, the food here is not quite on par with its counterparts in NYC. It's certainly tasty and spicy, but lacks the same \"wow\" factor as the other locations. It might have to do with the service, which is not so good. Out of our party of two, they constantly switched our orders and took quite the long amount of time in bringing the dishes. I asked to keep my sauce, and the waiter took it away from me. I had to ask for it back. I think this place has great food, but if services matters to you, you have been forewarned! Also they don't take American Express...just ViSA.", "business_id": "m7va7-30tTYEccRq6uxc_Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-01-30", "type": "review"}
