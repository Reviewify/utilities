(lol, that's a contradiction) do i look that much like an ave rat, as the angry gentleman so kindly put it, even though i'm like 16 years too old to be one? or is it just that sometimes the first movie is great and the sequel really sucks?", "business_id": "wVgJhDZutroaka8nw_rCaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-21", "type": "review"}
