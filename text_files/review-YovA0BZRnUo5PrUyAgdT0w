Just don't come to this specific location, which sucks. Just wanted to clear that up.} A follow-up visit just got me yelled at by the same dude who was a prick the last time. I dunno, guys, you're SO AWESOME on Cap Hill, but this location SO BAD. Sorry, but you've gotta be consistent; i'll try not to hold the badness here against the original, but it gets complicated sometimes.  Since i got yelled at for basically doing nothing, i decided to go elsewhere, so i can't really comment on the food. What gives, folks? Is it the hair? Am i too fat to be allowed to eat hot dogs here? (lol, that's a contradiction) Do i look that much like an Ave rat, as the angry gentleman so kindly put it, even though i'm like 16 years too old to be one? Or is it just that sometimes the first movie is great and the sequel really sucks?", "business_id": "wVgJhDZutroaka8nw_rCaw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-21", "type": "review"}
