This place is comparable to a bratwurst stand in Austin, TX that I frequent when I visit Austin (The Best Wurst).  I loved the familiarity of a good bratwurst and didn't think there was another place in this country that could top that..... I ordered the Hot Link (spicy of course) and I love how it doesn't come on those weak hot dog buns.  I topped it with ketchup, spicy mustard, and of course sauerkraut.....Absolutely amazing and delicious!\n\nI tried the Chicken Apple Dog as well and definately tasted unique.  If only, I lived in the city... I would like more than seconds!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qHmamQPCAKkia9X0uryA8g"}
