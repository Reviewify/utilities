We were absolutely dying for something delicious, filling, boozy (and banana bready) to fill that terrible hole in our stomachs, and man, did RHT ever deliver.\n\nThis Piggly Wiggly (Bacon Bourbon Bloody Mary) is maybe the best I've had. YUM!\n\nThe banana bread and jam of the day started things off nicely, and the Breakfast pizza was to die for. It's hard to mess up eggy brunch dishes, but these were all done phenomenally well.\n\nOh yeah, the beer list rocks, too. Can't wait to come back for Cask Ale Thursday.\n\n4 stars for slow (we were REALLY hungry) but friendly service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_9ZZv5V-uM5BXx3P-HslIw"}
