Warm and rich coloring, pretty glassware on the walls, very clean, very Zen music. The stylists have a dress-code and all look like people I'd trust my appearance to, but they are all very different in personality, which I like.\n\nOf course I loved my hair-do, cause I love Tiffany, but it was even better cause she seemed so happy there as a stylist. She told me that it was run very professionally, which is always nice to hear as a customer.\n\nBest part - they serve wine. I didn't have any cause it was 11am, but I noticed an attractive middle-aged housewife with a glass of white. Very classy.\n\nI can't speak for the massage services, but I would love to go back for a treatment. It's cool and chic, but not snobby. I wish I could afford to be a regular.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7YaObdiVy8F849amY6D2DQ"}
