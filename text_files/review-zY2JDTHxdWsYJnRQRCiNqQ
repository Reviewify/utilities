It's a standard burger and dog joint. Prices are reasonable but become outstanding on Mondays (during their dollar dog promotion). The inside is clean and the staff is very friendly. Parking in Westwood always blows, but if you're in the area and sick of Chipotle, it's a great place to grab a quick, affordable bite to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA"}
