It was a thrift store for a while, and now i think it's been knocked down for condos. Burgerdom in the U has not been the same since. Herfy's tried to crack it but like most of their attempts to move the South End hamburger juggernaut north of the canal, it failed.  This place, though, is like the Arctic Circle resurrected. You get fry sauce, and it's good. The fries are amazingly seasoned. The burger patties are thick and juicy and there's an amazing array of toppings. You only get dinged for adding costly stuff and not mayo or onions or lettuce. You can make it out a whole dollar under 10 bucks for a load of food. Punch card gets you free burgers. And, oh yeah, good Franz premium buns with real cheese, even if it's Umpqua and not Tillamook.  There's no pretense to this joint. They love their customers, they love making great burgers, and they love they do. Oh yeah, and it has freakin' wi-fi.  The U-District's independent food resurgence continues apace, and this place is a fine example of how to do it.", "business_id": "JTgm_nkQ-k6DTdV0mo0hYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-19", "type": "review"}
