Heck yes. \n\nI've been to other Wings over around the MA area and I will always be loyal to the Amherst one. \n\nThe inside is a bit small, so sometimes seating can take awhile, but in the end the food is great the waitstaff is friendly and there are TVs all over the place. As long as you aren't expecting a gourmet meal I would happily recommended Hangar to anyone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V63CGQ96PTNlz0xu3SIMtA"}
