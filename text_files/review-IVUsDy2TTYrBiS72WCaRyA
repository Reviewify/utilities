The decor was like a fast food style restaurant and parking was along the street. I was undecided as to what to order but luckily someone in front of us in line recommended the chicken or beef plate. (tarna and shawerma). We went with the chicken and it did not disappoint. It came with 2 pieces of pita bread, sliced chicken, salad/tomatoes, and some type of paste that had a unique flavor. This place was great and next time i'll be trying the beef plate at the montebello location. good eats!", "type": "review", "business_id": "EMXF_jbhx_GNniMnG0uNVw"}
