It's also like 5 seconds from my apartment and super convenient.  I haven't tried the ramen, but my roommate raved about it.  Doodles probably gets the nod as THE cheapest place to eat on campus.. which should sell any college student unsure of checking it out.  Granted ramen isnt very expensive in the first place, but the toppings they offer make it worthwhile I'm sure.  The owner is always super friendly when I come in.  Note: they charge an extra $.25 for credit cards which is understandable since it's such a small place and it's so cheap in the first place.", "business_id": "68HNLNwMfXu1NuL_2E4N7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-11", "type": "review"}
