I had two beers for $4 (total) and free chips and salsa. The salsa is amazing! (Especially for the price!) The info about the happy hour is on that site. I'm really happy there's at least a few times one can get cheap beer in Ann Arbor. I wish it were less smoky though.", "business_id": "2vUYE4Pjtgw8rjpPg4RMGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-13", "type": "review"}
