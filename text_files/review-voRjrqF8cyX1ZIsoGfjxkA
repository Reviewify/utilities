District for Mexican food, but definitely not really anywhere pushing above 3 stars here.   I usually get chicken enchiladas, and the food was good.  Service was prompt and nice.

Village if you're craving more affordable food.", "business_id": "695zb_QM1xk0maUCnIUANg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-04", "type": "review"}
