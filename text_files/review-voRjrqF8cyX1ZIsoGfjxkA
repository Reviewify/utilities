District for Mexican food, but definitely not really anywhere pushing above 3 stars here.  \n\nI usually get chicken enchiladas, and the food was good.  Service was prompt and nice.  Its location is next to the Burke-Gilmen, and a nice spot near U. Village if you're craving more affordable food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "695zb_QM1xk0maUCnIUANg"}
