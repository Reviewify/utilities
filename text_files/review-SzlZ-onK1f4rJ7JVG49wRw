The owner does look different though, I think that I would have remembered our server who was, by the by, an wonderfully polite [though quiet] old man. So maybe my memory is a tad incorrect =.=\n\nIts a pretty small little place, tucked away from the busy busy Ave. There's a max of 7 tables. \n\nPrices are pretty decent and [ applause ] its an entirely, completely Korean menu. I had the Yuk Gae Jang [I'm sorry if I butchered that] and it tasted...okay. My boyfriend got the tofu soup and it tasted far better [ exceptionally fresh too ]. The little side dishes [banchan] were okay as well - I liked the little onion pancake thingy. \n\nI would love to come back here during lunchtime just to grab a quick bite and satisfy my Korean tofu soup cravings - especially since University Way has been replaced by BBQ Chicken. [ tears ]\n\nP.s. they are working on getting a liquor license.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PFzF3dcRKGcziTf4KT0Skw"}
