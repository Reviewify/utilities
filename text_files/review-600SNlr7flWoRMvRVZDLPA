Then for someone new I crossed the bridge to the inner Sunset for a haircut. So now I can walk or ride my bike.   Yes, Berkeley's always had its share of trendy haircut places, but this spot really knows how to deal with Asian hair.  Rose is more talkative; the Korean lady is fine too- she uses this hair vaccuum which makes up for the lack of conversation.  I never ask for the Korean lady tho'- I just go in and get whoever's available.  They're both hip on not overdoing it w/ the thinning shears (like, not every month, they say.)", "business_id": "Mw_IkXUlEWhcnT8UEuIViw", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-12-14", "type": "review"}
