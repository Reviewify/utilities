I'm a pretty tall guy, to the ceilings make it really uncomfortable for me to stand around.  With my sensitivity to cigarette smoke I have real problems (there's supposedly a smoke-free area, but there are also supposedly unicorns in the world).  The covers are usually a bit much for me, too.\n\nOn the other hand, the clientele is excellent.  Everyone here seems to be a great balance of cool and real, hipster and chill, serious and fun, intellectual and spirited.  Not once have I gone to the Cave without meeting someone who I really like.\n\nThe beer selection isn't great, so be ready to crank back some PBR (not necessarily a bad thing, if you're ready for it).  It can get pretty crowded, depending on the entertainment, so you might want to show up early.", "type": "review", "business_id": "niLCCzHY6e0hcsMFcmpjtA"}
