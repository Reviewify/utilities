My buddy and I went to visit a good friend in Santa Barbara, and after an exerting day of ATVing, he promised us the best tri-tip sandwich we'd ever had. And man, did he deliver. We ordered a tri-tip sandwich for each, a basket of fries, and also a basket of onion rings. The fries and onion rings were fine, nothing you haven't seen before. But the sandwich was like Jesus Himself handcrafted it. Not that He doesn't has more important things to do. But anyways, the meat was succulent and delicious. The roll was grilled with just a hint of garlic, with a crunch on the outside leading to a soft and moist inside. The bbq sauce was so good we got more and started dipping our fries/onion rings in it.  Topped with a nice cold beer, some basketball on TV, and good company and conversation, it made my list of top ten meals of the year.", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-13", "type": "review"}
