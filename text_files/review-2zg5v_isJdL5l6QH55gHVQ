I'll agree with most of the comments: - the portions seem small and the menu is small. That is because we are used to glutting ourselves on food portions that are FAR TOO LARGE. Plus, it's a small taco station; - the tortillas are delicious, and the sauce really good too; - it would be nice if there was a salsa bar and Mexican cokes; - the seating is really nice: tables with umbrellas and it's located at the less busy (toward PCC) end of Green Street, so plenty of parking. And the people who work here are REALLY nice! If you feel like leaving the hot, traffic-y part of Pasadena and driving down the shaded Green Street WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS FREE PARKING, this place is an oasis near the end.", "business_id": "wW9eE3x2TsndTKqRdAMhLA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-20", "type": "review"}
