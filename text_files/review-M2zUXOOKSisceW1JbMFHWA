Got the jerk chicken in a smaller portion, which was the perfect size.  And at only $5 it was a pretty good deal.  The chicken was well seasoned and well cooked, but as other yelpers had said, there were a lot of bones and not so much meat.  \n\nThe rice and beans were yummy, but the slaw was a bit too sweet for my tastes.  \n\nThe worker seemed really nice and it's a nice place to just hang out.  Would I go back? Probably not.  But it was a good lunch with a good friend =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "oPPvQTdHZ7cwbVzpT_R4PA"}
