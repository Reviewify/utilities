Got the jerk chicken in a smaller portion, which was the perfect size. And at only $5 it was a pretty good deal. The chicken was well seasoned and well cooked, but as other yelpers had said, there were a lot of bones and not so much meat. The rice and beans were yummy, but the slaw was a bit too sweet for my tastes. The worker seemed really nice and it's a nice place to just hang out. Would I go back? Probably not. But it was a good lunch with a good friend =)", "business_id": "oPPvQTdHZ7cwbVzpT_R4PA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}
