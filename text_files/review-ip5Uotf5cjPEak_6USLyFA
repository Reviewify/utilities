I'm not too familiar with Indian food but this sure tasted good.  The atmosphere was relaxing and not too uptight, the services was prompt and professional, and the food was fairly priced.  Shalimar is definitely food to crave!  If you stop by you won't be disappointed.  Quick tip: make a reservation or call ahead Thurs-Sat nights.", "business_id": "hCnQgU5GyG3yWGiwLMHCzA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-26", "type": "review"}
