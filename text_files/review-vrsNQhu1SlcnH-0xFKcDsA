I rarely give out bad reviews, even more seldom do I give a one star.  This 'bar' was a complete failure. I went there on a Friday night and several things went wrong. First of all they allow minors in the building.  So that means you have to wear a bracelet as if you are going to a festival. If you are a bar or pub then be a bar or pub and check ID at the door. The bracelet idea is dumb.  Secondly, they ran out of beer....at least 6 or 7 taps ran empty on a Friday night. WTF? They finally had someone run out  grab some tall-boys of PBR.  The third and final strike was the service. 3 servers and over a hundred people trying to order. Boo. Fail. There were other problems but i am not going to bother.", "business_id": "c2yujgH3HUSFMi8ktiCmrw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-17", "type": "review"}
