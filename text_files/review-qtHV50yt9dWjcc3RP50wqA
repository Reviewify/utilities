Came here to meet with some people over a warm, luscious double espresso w/cream.  An orange-almond Luxembourger and my coffee time is complete!  On subsequent visits I tried the lavender, ginger, and pistachio varieties--all were good!  Everything's a little on the pricey side though.  Those lil Luxembourgers, for example, will cost you $0.75 a piece. Keep an eye out for the free samples... they crop up by the chocolates counter from time to time.  I tried their white chocolate-pistachio bar that way.  It was delish, but I was too sweeted-out by then to be in the mood to purchase more sugary goodness.", "business_id": "gctbL0lDIYIHM6yDn99V-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-07", "type": "review"}
