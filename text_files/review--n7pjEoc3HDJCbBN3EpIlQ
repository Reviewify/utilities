Pros: As an amateur bodybuilder and student, it is good to use a big and new gym facility. They have good quality equipments and a giant locker room downstairs. The ventilation in this place is also great. Cons: Athletes always be taking half/most important part of the gym, leaving everybody else extremely cramped.
