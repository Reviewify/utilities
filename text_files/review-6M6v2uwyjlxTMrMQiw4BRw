What a nice discovery! We almost went to Wawa for coffee which would have been a sad mistake. We got breakfast platters here. Very good non-factory/non-chain bagels in lots of varities, which we can't find in Princeton downtown. We had the rye and the cinnamon-sugar. Very big any chewy, gave our jaws a workout. \n\nNon-bagels: the eggs and potatoes were good, coffee and sausage ok, bacon not good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YnXHQH8B6NbLSUmH9rJkaA"}
