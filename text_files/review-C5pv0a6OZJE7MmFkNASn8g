I went here with my family when picking up my brother from Cal Poly on a recommendation from a friend. \nSO GLAD he told me about it! The staff was very patient while everyone decided. I got the clam chowder in a bread bowl with seafood topping (as recommended by my friend) and it was literally the best clam chowder of my life! It was super rich but I loved every bite! They even take the inside of the bread bowl and toast and butter it. Sooo yummy! And the little shrimp and crab chunks were the perfect touch. \nAtmosphere was nice as well, next time if I am not so full would love to try their desserts, they look awesome!", "type": "review", "business_id": "frnSVqsuOOx_5VYV6H4Mew"}
