When it's good.... it is GOOD.  When it's an off day... it isn't horrible, but \"I am paying HOW MUCH for this overcooked omelette?\" tends to come up in my head a few times...\n\nTypically I am more into the umami/savory brunch, but the time I risked straying from my usual choices and got a waffle, I was not disappointed!  It was light and fluffy on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside.  Perfection!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BlUEgCOGzDwpOWnkQn3odw"}
