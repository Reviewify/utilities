I really like the atmosphere inside. When I went for lunch it was pretty empty which was nice because we got to sit by the front windows. I had the Michigan Salad and my BF had a burger, I really enjoyed my salad and my BF liked his burger though he said it was a little overdone. The fries were delicious. Our waiter was a little slow, but they had very few people working, so that is understandable and it really want's bad. When I went for drinks it was on a Friday evening and although they were definitely doing good businesses it didn't feel too crowded or too loud inside which is pretty impressive. Their cocktails are a little on the pricey side, but they are also pretty strong. At some bars I can drink several cocktails without even feeling a little tipsy, at The Ravens Club I could actually feel it after only one drink and I didn't drink it fast. Our waitress was really great, there was a large-ish group of us and she gave us individual checks without even batting an eyelash. Overall I really liked The Ravens Club and hope to go back again. The only thing I would say is that they are a little pricey when it comes to both food and drinks. This isn't a bad place for groups, but it is mostly sitting space, so it's not great for a large group that has people coming and going throughout the night.", "business_id": "93afWhCcHLuJsC4Jf4sQPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-11", "type": "review"}
