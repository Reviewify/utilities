Craftland = literally, my craft heaven. Filled with the wonders of local artists; hanging on the walls, displayed around the store, or nestled safely behind glass display cases. The variety of pieces is always changing, so you will always have a chance to preview new art ripe for the buying (new ink-press prints/paintings are rotated out, so you'll always see something new!). Painting, print-press, photography, knitted garb, hand-made/organic soaps and candles, unique jewelry, and some of the cutest little infant clothes/onesies EVER (some great \"I *heart* R.I.\" items). I my only wish: that I lived CLOSER to this wonder! Whenever I'm in town, it's one of my first stops (for art - for gifts - ....for Lulu). i'm in la-la-la-Love.", "business_id": "Ly5jUcy8VVSG_F9N1eJvgA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-01", "type": "review"}
