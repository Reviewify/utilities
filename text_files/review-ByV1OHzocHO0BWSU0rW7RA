I can understand waiting in line as they do cook the food to order, but the staff was surly and not at all welcoming. \n\nThe food was hot, but that is about the only compliment we could give. The fish fry had no taste. The chili sauce had no taste. The onion rings had no taste.\n\nI don't get it. Maybe this location is just different. We will not be spending money here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4Asa_ZggWWgr5EAuTUY2cQ"}
