Not fantastic, but definitely not bad.  They only have sizes regular, large, and extra large, but their regular is about the same as most restaurants small.  \n\nWhat I didn't like was that the restaurant was essentially empty and so my \"private\" conversation was heard by all.  It felt kind of... echoey.  Also, my friend had to get up and pick up his cup before the waiter realized we needed more water.\n\nThe good thing is they do take Visa and Mastercard unlike Pho Than Brothers down the street.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AUz4akyLb32J7SDa_nKgMQ"}
