You can tell this was once an amazing hotel.  It's a little worn and a tiny bit dated, but served my purpose just fine.  I never missed a wakeup call, received room service in about 20 minutes it seemed.  The coffee thing is weird.  I am very used to being able to get coffee (not in-room coffee) from about 5am on.  Didn't happen.  They have a little restaurant on the second floor that opens at 7, though the front desk told me 6:30AM.  I'm up at five most days.  So I go down at 7 and got the worst cup of coffee I've had in three years and payed almost four dollars for it.  There is no business center, you have to go into this weird guest shop to print, though the man in there was extremely nice and didn't even charge me. \n\nEven with these things, I'd probably never stay anywhere else.  It's highly unlikely that I'll ever find myself in providence again, ever, but if I did, I'd choose Westin.  I worked for Starwood for almost ten years in sales and marketing (started with ITT Sheraton) and its always like going home to me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "a92K_ONVyJ73QprNUZ9e0g"}
