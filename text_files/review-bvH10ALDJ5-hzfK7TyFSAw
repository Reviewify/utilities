I work in Pasadena and we cater from different places every Friday. Fredo's is one of the places we frequent being that we are pizza fiends.. The Santa Fe Chicken Pizza is my absolute favorite. Marinated chicken breast, red onion, avocado, tomato, cilantro. This is a hand tossed and baked to perfection. Important factor for me and pizza is the next morning reheat satisfaction.. Pop it in the mic the next day and again happiness in your mouth once again. The Antipasto Salad is also a winner: With ham, mortadella, salami, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, black olives, tomatoes, and italian dressing. I haven't dined in so I don't have anything to comment on that but the delivery service is spot on!", "business_id": "GsoYOQQ_7L9amG78lucepQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-05", "type": "review"}
