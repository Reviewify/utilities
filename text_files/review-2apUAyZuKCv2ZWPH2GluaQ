This place is SO yummy. \n\nI would try the following: \n\nPad-See- Ew Tofu and Pork (Spicy at #5) \nGreen Curry w/ Chicken (Spicky at #5) \nGarlic Grilled Pork \n\nIf you order at least 3 entrees (or maybe its a dollar amount). They give you free appetizers (6-8 fried wantons stuffed with minced meat). \n\nNot a big fan of their beef because its a little tough for my liking, but I like their pork because its lean and prepared perfectly. \n\nI would recommend this place over President Thai (which I personally think isn't as great) and President Thai Two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7fqyfAKK36pjoeMyOD-XVQ"}
