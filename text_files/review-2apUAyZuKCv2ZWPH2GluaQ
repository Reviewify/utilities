This place is SO yummy.  I would try the following:  Pad-See- Ew Tofu and Pork (Spicy at #5)  Green Curry w/ Chicken (Spicky at #5)  Garlic Grilled Pork  If you order at least 3 entrees (or maybe its a dollar amount). They give you free appetizers (6-8 fried wantons stuffed with minced meat).  Not a big fan of their beef because its a little tough for my liking, but I like their pork because its lean and prepared perfectly.  I would recommend this place over President Thai (which I personally think isn't as great) and President Thai Two.", "business_id": "7fqyfAKK36pjoeMyOD-XVQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-18", "type": "review"}
