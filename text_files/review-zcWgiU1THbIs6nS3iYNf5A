However, if I didn't go to school a stone's throw away, I wouldn't come here.  For one, it's ridiculously crowded and hard to find anything. Add in the fact that it's overpriced ($5.99 for essentially a travel-sized deodorant--I forgot to put some on in the morning, no big deal), and I'm not a fan.  However, I must say that their salads (toss-in variety) are pretty good, if overpriced, and they have quite a selection of prepared foods for a quick meal.", "business_id": "hlkCbViTRlQ5-lx8gopeoA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-12", "type": "review"}
