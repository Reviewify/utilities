For a short period of time a few years back, it seemed as if the food quality and service was really going down hill so I stayed away until about a year ago because I missed their brunch.  At that visit, it appeared that things were back to normal and for that, I was thankful.  They have a buffet style brunch set up on the Paragon and Viva side, with just about everything you can imagine: eggs, omelette's to order, home fries, bacon, pastas, prime rib, ham, danish, pastries, fish, fruit, shrimp cocktail, etc.  Their regular lunch/dinner is great; sandwiches, salads, pasta/meat/fish dishes.  In the spring and summer months I like to get a table outside on the sidewalk, order a pitcher of red sangria, the grilled portabella sandwich and people watch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WhANqUQu_SJIuD7g8AXTAg"}
