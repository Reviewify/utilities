I don;t really find it necessary to have more than ten reviews for Black Ink. It's a visit worth for your first trip to Harvard Square. It's across the street from the Curious George Store. It has tall shelves of cutesy not so useful gifts. Whoop. Dee. Doo.\n\nI can't find any other reason to really go in there ..well except for the best thing to ever have been created. The small mini photo travel book with pictures of every everday item possible.. so instead of learning the language.. you can instead point at your goal and go UHH UHH when you go to foreign lands. Also the gift wrapping patterns hanging behind the counter are worth the purchase.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d6asV_ziLv0SpOUEy9BWmg"}
