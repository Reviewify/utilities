I've never had pho this bad. The ambiance is great, but the pho was just horrible. \n\nThe bean sprouts were just small and not fresh, the mint leaves weren't fresh either. And the beef tripe... YELLOW?? WTF?!? WHY THE HELL WAS THE BEEF TRIPE YELLOW? \n\nThe beef-balls were almost flavorless, the other beef had little to no taste to it as well.  The soup was bland and watered down, with a thick layer of oil on the top.  Even after drenching my soup in sriracha the soup still tasted like oily water.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZmYIPv4XQQ2bT4dgl6ezzA"}
