I almost feel like it was my second home in A^2. Most of the staff are really cool people. There's this older fellow who usually takes down your name (he was still there in April '07). Apparently, he's an Amy Winehouse fan. That'll be sure to start an interesting conversation if you're waiting. Don't tell him how you found out.   Oh. Food. Right. I usually ate the turkey burger and fries with Newcastle. Delicious.", "business_id": "n-0sVDLw6kkK5On6vZ30Zw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-08", "type": "review"}
