Quite frankly, however, I wonder how the old Harvard Square survived all those years existing as it did in the shadow of Harvard University, undoubtedly one of the most corporate of all Establishment mega-corporations. At Harvard Square, you can have breakfast at IHOP, browse for books at the Harvard Coop (really just Barnes & Noble), have lunch at Au Bon Pain, stop for refreshments at Dunkin' Donuts, and pick up some clothes at the Gap or Urban Outfitters. What's not to like? Four stars for now but Harvard Square will get five once it's finally enclosed and the bums that litter the streets are relocated to Central Square. Why do I want to be reminded about Life's unfortunates when I'm hanging out at the mall?", "business_id": "UGs6J02mK_DTxDPfrJoviw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-01", "type": "review"}
