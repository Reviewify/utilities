Gems! Gems! & more Gems! Makes you feel like ur at tiffany's w/ all the glass cases\n2.) Dinos obviously, you can click on their touch screen to see which parts of the skeleton is real vs. a cast\n3.) Hall of Sculpture - when you walk in ur surrounded in greek architecture; of course their casts but still gives u the feel\n4.) Sperm Whale Exibit - if it is still there check it out interesting to hear the maori tribe story\n5.) Art side...meh not too much that I liked but for ppl who like old oils / contemporary art (i.e., canvas covered in black paint, elephant dung, rocks in a circle) then its for you\n\nCafe \n* Not bad food either sandwich w/ a side for around $6-$7", "type": "review", "business_id": "K3p2iyJ8xRU5-5NlvoxiFA"}
