The place is decorated nice. The front has lounge couches for a good happy hour, but on Fridays it does get packed, so come early! For dinner, you can order a main dish, do the all you can eat salad bar or the full brazilian steak buffet experience. I would highly recommend the full experience for $40. The food here is amazing. I love their salad bar. Lots of exotic concoctions of salads, sides, and even fish. Then you get served a bread plate with yummy polenta sticks, these awesome cheese balls, which I had 3, and fried banana. You can ask for more if you want. Then comes the meat. All of it was very tasty, tender, and had the right amount of special spices. The lamb chops were AMAZING! First time having chicken hearts and it was good. Tritip, awesome filet mignon, parmeson filet mignon, spicy chicken, lemon chicken, flank, sirloin with garlic, sirloin, pork and lamb gourmet sausages, and bacon wrapped chicken. This place is so good. When we went there, we even saw the 49ers and they sat right next to us. IT was awesome! Def would come here again!", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-08", "type": "review"}
