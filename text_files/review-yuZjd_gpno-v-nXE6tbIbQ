(+) big proportions, so you get your money's worth! (+) cheap food (+) close to campus (+) quick (-) kinda shady looking and very hole in the wall, dirty feeling (-) there's always bums right outside (-) they give too much food and it tastes way too good so you end up eating too much......oh wait, is that a bad thing? maybe i should put this under a plus....hmmm....... overall: i think i found my go to place for lunch!", "business_id": "WaxhDYWQmZ1FGM2ChY7_2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-27", "type": "review"}
