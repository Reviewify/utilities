Yummy hummus, yummy pita break, yummy salad, YUMMY chicken and some ok rice! Oh my gosh, I was in Med food heaven! This was Chicken Shawarma done right!\n2) Lamb Shawarma plate: thin strips of juicy but lightly crispy lamb with the same yummy pita bread, hummus and salad (and there was rice). I didn't know food around campus could taste SO good! I'm in utter shock that I haven't tried this place or heard more good things about food here!\n\n(+) BIG proportions, so you get your money's worth!\n(+) cheap food\n(+) Close to campus \n(+) Quick\n(-) kinda shady looking and very hole in the wall, dirty feeling\n(-) There's always bums right outside\n(-) they give too much food and it tastes way too good so you end up eating too much......oh wait, is that a bad thing? Maybe I should put this under a plus....hmmm.......\n\nOverall: I think I found my go to place for lunch!", "type": "review", "business_id": "WaxhDYWQmZ1FGM2ChY7_2Q"}
