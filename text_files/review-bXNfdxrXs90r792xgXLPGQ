This store has everything. Now, when ever I need a great gift or something interesting for my home or office, I stop by Ontology. The inventory changes all the time, due the new gently used furniture and nic nacks that are displayed creatively around the store. They also have new things as well. Great cards, jewerly, mints and etc. Cute seasonal items too. I bought the best zombie dish there for halloween. You won't be disappointed if you stop by.", "business_id": "GfekZoOyI1wpJqNx24j2HA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-25", "type": "review"}
