Maybe we ordered the wrong things? I ordered the vegetable scramble and hubby ordered eggs Benedict. Both dishes came with super oily and soggy potatoes. My scramble was also oily and the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was too lemony. Won't be coming here again. Esp with so many better places in the area. Oh yeah and they don't validate for the parking structure that is in the same building.", "business_id": "Dh3X5NuzAcFZSSl72a5lWg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}
