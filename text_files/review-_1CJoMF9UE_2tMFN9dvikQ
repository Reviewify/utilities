So someone tell me how I got food poisoning from this sushi? Obviously some ghetto factors here, and cleanliness issues. I've eaten here perhaps 3 times, and gotten sick once, so I guess it might have been a rare occasion.\n\nNot just that though, I ordered my roll to go, and I was standing around waiting for 20 minutes or so, and the guy at the register (I believe he owns the place too! Shame on him...) is just chatting in Korean with his buddy, and I'm standing there, right in front, waiting for my food (in the meantime, my boyfriend's already ordered Thai Basil and received his food and been waiting with me for 10 minutes)... and the guy doesn't ask me what I'm waiting for, he doesn't check on my order. It was only when the 2 chefs were basically standing around doing nothing, that I realized that either my order was forgotten or it wasn't made or already made...\n\nThe owner didn't seem to care that I was standing there waiting for something that wasn't coming, so I approached him and asked, and my roll had been sitting in a box next to him for who knows how long, and he didn't bother figuring out why it was there and what I was waiting for. WTF?\n\nNot going back here. Sorry. Go to Joshuya's on Dwight and Telegraph instead, or go to the REAL Sushi House in Alameda.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g5S6Q9W0IwN5AEK3fNWzbw"}
