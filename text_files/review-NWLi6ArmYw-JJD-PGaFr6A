Not only was I able to get everything--mani/pedi, facial AND bikini wax!--but got a sweet deal thanks to Beauty Week specials. Even without the extra savings incentive, I love so many things about Nami that I'll come back for more. Rebecca, who did my facial and wax, is a sweetheart and puts me at ease. She does a thorough and thoroughly relaxing treatment. For a private party, the back patio is a wonderful spot (especially for the antics of a bachelorette). The interiors are chic but cozy, the air scented with lavender and other refreshingly relaxing aromas. It's laid back, but you still get pampered. Being a Yelper-owned business, I'm bumping this up to 5 stars.", "business_id": "rJXrQljoTzMuyHOpVN74qg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-06", "type": "review"}
