They were just plain low-fat frozen yogurt bars on a stick. No chocolate coating, no added poisons -- and they were fantastic! Of course, they eventually discontinued them and I spent years testing out random and disappointing substitutes (Tasti-D-Lite should be banned). \n\nEnter Pinkberry. The original flavor is the frozen yogurt of my memory. Light, flavorful, not sugary sweet and not filled with preservatives. Just delicious. \n\nThis is the closest Pinkberry to my house and admittedly I've only eaten Pinkberry about 10 times in my life. I actually love the tangy sweet original flavor but don't really feel inclined to schlep 10 blocks out of my way to buy expensive frozen yogurt on a regular basis. I was delighted to learn they deliver! \n\nI placed a delivery order on a Saturday evening and it took 60 minutes for it to arrive. When it did, it was delightfully packaged and just as yummy as I remembered it. They do have a minimum fee for ordering (I think it's $10) so I ordered the largest size (a pint?) with side orders of strawberries...it was enough pinkberry for a week! \n\nWhile delivery was slow by NYC standards, it seems a reasonable amount of time to wait for a delectable treat like this.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yiR4dDit58T8pYg1GMvO3Q"}
