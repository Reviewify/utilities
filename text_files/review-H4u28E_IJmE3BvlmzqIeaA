The menu is uninspiring and needs more focus (is it diner food?  is it italian?  maybe a little french? is it really mediterranean?)  I got the penne which was waaay overdone, and waaaay underseasoned.  not worth the 9 bucks.  To save costs they could get rid of the mediocre table bread.  I hope the best for them but I don't think I'll eat there again just because I can easily find a restaurant for all of Eclipse's menu offerings.  Want wood oven fired pizza?  walk down the street to Jupiter.  Want really amazing pasta?  head to Riva Cucina.  A burger?  Mel's, Barney's...anywhere.  Chicken sandwhich?  Grab n' Go has a pretty good one for a good price.  Onion tarte (random)?  I'm sure La Note has something close... I really wish it was a real cafe because I need a good spot to chill and read a good book downtown.  Oh well...like i said before, best of luck to them.", "business_id": "MgV5LM0rX0yrVMu9K1kXGw", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-07-10", "type": "review"}
