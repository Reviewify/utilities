I walked in with pretty high expectations and to be blown away by this little spot, but really wasn't.  The service wasn't great, the place is in need of a new paint job and some cozier furniture, the breakfast goods weren't really labeled well, and the selection wasn't great.  The upside?  My scone and coffee were really delicious.  I got a lemon scone to go, and when I got a chance to eat it, the icing was tangy and perfect and the scone had a great flavor to it.  I really liked it.  And for $4.25 for breakfast, that's not a bad deal.\n\nTo go, it was a good experience, but I wouldn't hang out here.....the counter service was lacking (I don't like being looked through when I am greeted, but maybe that's just me) and the atmosphere isn't warm and inviting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b_JzakNJhumpafAnXertgQ"}
