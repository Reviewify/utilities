The hostess made 4 - 5 round trips past us without ever uttering  a word. She even had to scoot past my mother and sister repeatedly and never said \"Excuse me,\" \"May I get by you,\" or \"Move.\" Nothing. Just silence. The bartender said nothing, too. Eventually we tired of the gross display of tactlessness and took our business elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ofJkkF9CpfBtZdnopzxJBg"}
