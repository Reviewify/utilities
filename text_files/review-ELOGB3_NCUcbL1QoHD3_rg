I was pretty disappointed. The falafel was not what I would call falafel and they rolled it in a tortilla styled pita (very thin, not thick pita bread). I always stuff my falafel in pita. Anyways, the price is OK, but I won't go back here. I will hold out for Rami's in Brookline.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YeRXjIzxc9FaK6uyrTBvkQ"}
