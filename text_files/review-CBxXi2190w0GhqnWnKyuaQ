I've been here at least 5 times since they opened, which was about 3 weeks ago.  The guys who work here already know my name and what I'm going to order.\n\nThe prices are pretty good.  It's a little more expensive than a normal food truck, but it's well worth the price.  You can get a burger with unlimited toppings for $6 (I do avocado, grilled onions, cheese, bacon, black pepper, and mayo) with great fries and a drink for an extra $3.  I don't think $9 for all that is too unreasonable.\n\nIn my opinion, the only place that rivals the spot in terms of burgers in the rest of University City is Bobby's Burger Palace, but the same thing will cost you around $14 and a lot more time.\n\nIn terms of the cheesesteak, it is one of the best I've ever eaten.  The cheesesteak is made from thick, juicy steak and you can get whatever you want on it.  I haven't tried the spot dog or pulled pork.\n\nOverall, this place is probably the best food truck that I've tried on Drexel's campus.  Go here and try it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "5N9nJbymj9JtOAEx6ZMxpg"}
