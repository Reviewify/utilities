The restaurant interior is tiny with only a few tables. There's a larger outdoor back patio with a rock/water feature which is nice at night. There's also some seating outside in the alleyway between two buildings -- it's nicer than it sounds. Best seat in the house is in the outdoor back patio so call ahead to reserve.  The menu was pretty interesting with a nice variety of appetizers and entrees. The portions are small and are great to share. There's also a nice selection of wine flights around the $10+/- range which make for a fun evening. We started off with the [Fresh Burrata and Shaved Fennel Salad: aged balsamic vinegar and oven dried tomatoes] and [Crab Fritters: black pepper aioli and Carolina mustard sauce]. Both were very good. I liked the combination of all of the components of the salad and what's not to like about fried crab cakes? For entrees, we had the [Farwell Burger: tarragon, caramelized onions, remoulade sauce, melted emmental] and the [Halibut a la Veracruzana: olives, onions, capers, tomato ragout]. Both were delicious as well. The burger was very satisfying and all of the components of the halibut dish really worked well together. I normally don't order fish but since I've been trying to eat healthier decided to order it. I actually ended up enjoying the halibut more than the burger. Surprise surprise. I'll definitely be coming back to order it. Overall it's a great place for a more relaxed and casual dinner. A great place to sample wine as well.", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-13", "type": "review"}
