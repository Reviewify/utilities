It's small and cozy, but large enough to accomodate all of their treatments in a comfortable, relaxed setting. The general ambiance here: with the colours, furniture, soothing music and other decor is very Zen. I was impressed at how tirelessly the staff worked when the Y.E.S. event was held here, and how friendly and patient they were as we clamored for one of the lovely services we could choose from: manicures, hand and foot massages, chair massages, makeup application or eye treatments.  I opted for the chair massage, and Dan's deft and expert hands soothed me so much that I was in a comfortable sleepy daze for some time afterwards. I didn't even realize how much I needed it until he gently told me it was over. The makeup application and manicures looked fantastic, I hear the eye treatment was great, and the hand and foot massages looked oh-so-relaxing. Often, I have gripes about mani/pedi salons in Boston - I tend to like a clean, modern look, and hate that \"seashell dish\" scene. I also really dislike rushed treatments, since they are supposed to be more of a pampering luxury. Wonderful then, that Nami Spa is so conveniently located in the South End, since it's pretty accessible and it's exactly the type of atmosphere I've been looking for. I just wish they did threading too! Prices are not super-low - it's a spa, after all - but for the quality, you are actually paying a pretty reasonable amount. Their massages in particular are very reasonably priced, especially when you are comparing to other salons in the South End/Back Bay area. At least, the idea of a 60-minute relaxation massage for $100 sounds worth it to me!", "business_id": "rJXrQljoTzMuyHOpVN74qg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-06-28", "type": "review"}
