I am digging this food truck.  I went for a killer lunch the other day and I can't wait to go back.  My co worker and  I had the following:\nKorean BBQ Short Rib Beef Taco- Flavorful, moist, delicious, great size\nEdamame Tacos- I thought this was better as a salad or side.  It was light and fresh but it didn't need the taco\nPork Bun- The bun was a soft pillow for the decadent pork. The pork was fatty and salty and wonderful\nThai Basil Chicken over Rice- Talk about huge.  This was enough for lunch and dinner.  It came with Kimchi and edamame and chick peas.  The dish was comforting, satisfying and exciting.\nTyson Bees was exactly what I need to break up my monotonous work day.  And something cool and original they do here is when you place your order they give you a playing card.  When your order is ready they call your playing card. Fun!", "type": "review", "business_id": "F48wjJ_jjEz59Prh20XhRA"}
