It is really tiny tiny place, so usually for lunch there is a line. It's owned by Koreans, and I always tend to like the Korean owned sushi places, so I love this place. Plus its close by to UCSD. Hidden in a little shopping center, it's sometimes difficult to find parking. I wish it was open a bit later though. Plus with a name like Yummy Maki Yummy Box...I always get the name wrong...Yummy Yummy Maki Box...that works too, people still know what your talking about. I usually just get the box lunches, and that satisfies me for the rest of my work day. And the prices are pretty good. The place is clean. I like  give it two thumbs up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o7BQ5ZQDWbplY1nKKl_FEg"}
