Mexicali Burrito caters!  And for serious, they take the nut for Mexican food catering (as compared with Picante catering... which technically wasn't catered, because I couldn't justify paying their delivery fee, so I picked up and was utterly dismayed) in Cambridge for their superb pricing, appetite-filling, responsiveness, accommodating-ness, and kindness.\n\nThe baseline cost for the burrito platter was $70 for 10 orders, including 10 full sized burritos with a filling choice, cheese, rice, and beans; and chips, salsas, and paper products; more than enough food to satisfy 10 hungry co-workers.  Oh, but did I have a convenient 10 co-workers to satisfy? No, I had 15.  And Mexicali ACCOMMODATED that number with the same unit pricing (i.e. $7 per person).  Add tax and 10% delivery fee, and you're still much less than $10 per person.\n\nThe burrito was girthy and filled with a higher rice/bean to filling ratio than what you can expect from the store, but it was still very satisfying and quite manageable for consumption.  With the addition of 2 large guac-sides and those sauces (+some self-purchased sour cream), the overall tastiness improved.\n\nI also have to give a hand to Eric, who coordinated the order, responded to all 4 of my ridiculous email inquiries, and even delivered the meal (on time, no doubt).  He confides that they respond best to phone calls, but I'm a busy lady and deal much better with email; and certainly know a thing or two about not receiving email responses in the immediate; so really really, this was no concern.\n\nWill I order catering again from Mexicali?  Heck yah.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIteGpWzFpQblKuwt7H80w"}
