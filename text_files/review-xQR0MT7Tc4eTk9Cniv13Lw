I went in, and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need.  You only need to speak to Larry for a few moments to realize he is very experienced, and yet very humble and approachable.  I bought my bike there, have had it tweaked a few times, rented a second bike, a bike seat, a tag-along, and most recently came back with my wife to buy a new bike for her.  I can't say enough great things about this shop.  (It also doesn't hurt that they're a block from Central Park!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "00rrqw4O0Flfatd0VV6QAg"}
