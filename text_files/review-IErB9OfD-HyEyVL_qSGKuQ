My daughter had eaten here five years ago at a time when she was an extremely finicky eater and a vegetarian. She had been dragged in against her will by a group from work. Since the boss was paying, she went along. She says it turned her eating life around. She used to hate Japanese restaurants because there was so little for her to order. But Japon Bistro had a tofu dish she loved. Now she is no longer a vegetarian and has become a little more adventurous in her eating. She wanted to celebrate her 28th birthday here, so our whole family went last night. We were all very pleased. I had the beef tongue appetizer. It was fabulous! Then I had the Japanese spaghetti, which was actually seafood linguini, loaded with clams, mussels, and shrimp. It was excellent. I also was allowed to finish one of my other daughter's plates---she was too full. The bell pepper tempura was a surprise and absolutely scrumptious. By the way, in spite of what one reviewer said, the portions were large. By Japanese restaurant standards they were HUGE. i topped my meal off with an order of uni sushi. It was spectacular. Incredibly fresh, it tasted like they had just pulled it out of the ocean. Because of the birthday, at the end they served the entire table mochi and ice cream. Fabulous! We left happy and full. I am only sorry I never got to see the original staff that Malachi talked about. If they were superior to the good waitress and waiter we had, they must have been truly amazing.", "business_id": "v77A8jl3eXfO3UgMC-ydig", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-20", "type": "review"}
