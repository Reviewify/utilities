I've been coming here for about 2 years. They have great drink specials, a great beer menu, and it's a very friendly, cozy environment. The seating allows for all kinds of atmospheres... if you feel like observing others you can sit outside, if you're looking for a more intimate setting you can sit in one of their large, somewhat hidden booths, and if you're just wanting to chill with friends, you can enjoy their eclectic seating throughout the bar. The music is nice, and the bartenders are super friendly. The owner is such a sweetheart as well, once you are a regular there he is known to sit at your table and chat, and maybe even buy you a drink! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZT_0yAeFxuihVnGXoCbWQ"}
