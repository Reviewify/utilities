We booked an early reservation via Opentable for 5pm, and I had looked over the menu before we arrived. I was pleased to see a variety of food, and also a children's menu, for our 6 year old son. We arrive and there are a few other groups that looked like they just got seated. What really surprised me were all of the buffet tureens that had been set up. Buffet? ECH. Ok, we can roll with that, I guess... I tried to like it, really, I did. Almost all of the items had barbeque sauce on them - gross! I was not in the mood for BBQ, and if so, I'd hit Memphis Minnie's around the corner. Anyhow... the food was dismal. The chicken was way overcooked. The pulled pork was too sweet. The only decent things were the lamb and the beef- both from the carving station. I should also add that they went from having a full kids menu on a regular menu to having not ONE single item that was particularly kid-friendly. If all of this weren't enough, the service was lacking. They did special order some pasta with cheese and butter for my son, but it arrived after 20 minutes. I think they forgot about it. Then, I spent about 15 minutes with plates in front of me after I had been finished. This is with a bus person and server all around our table. We ditched on the dessert items in the buffet and headed out. Who needs brownies with nuts, anyhow? The real kicker was when I headed out, I said to the person at the front , \"thank you, goodbye.\" I am polite, after all. What was the response?? Total silence. Not going back, no way.", "business_id": "usSxrJO3XgB5RD9AOb8L3w", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-04-12", "type": "review"}
