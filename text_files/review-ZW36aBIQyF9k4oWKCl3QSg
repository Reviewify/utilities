I used to adore this place because milk tea + boba = 1.09. Then it went up to 1.19. All the sudden, it went up to .99 for tea and .50 for boba. WHAT THE HELL! With this price, I am definitely going to Lotus House for their much better tasting tea and much better boba. Honestly, this place was only bearable when the price was low. I used to make Sweetheart my default and Lotus House as my secondary luxury boba. But now, with the price hike, I suggest everyone migrate to Lotus House. Lotus House actually mixes the tea in front of you and it's not as sweet. Overall, I really hate the Cantonese speaking douchebag who keeps on yelling at his workers. This is another tragedy of understanding Cantonese. I hate it when I go to a restaurant and the workers think that you don't understand what they are saying, therefore, giving them the right to say whatever they want. Douche! I was considering a one star, but their salty chicken is actually pretty good and they have spices by the exit that allows you to control the spice level of your chicken. That's the only other redeeming quality.", "business_id": "j9tMEV719PzFcc_wp8mzlw", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-10", "type": "review"}
