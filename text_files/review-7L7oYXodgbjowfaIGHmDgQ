I've never seen so many hats in one store before, it's a vintage hat lovers heaven! but at about $50, that's higher then the other vintage shops. super selection though of both women's and men's clothes including lots of funky dress up items and jewelry. The owner is a very sweet and friendly woman from Montana. I randomly found this spot while walking to central sq, it's a must visit if you're a vintage lover!", "business_id": "zHEkAtKIV6RfmWCu3nzPyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-10", "type": "review"}
