This place makes the best Thai food I've ever had, and I'm kind of a Thai food fanatic. \n\nThe first time I had Thai Tom's, it was my friend's cold left-over Swimming Rama. Best. Ever. Obviously, when it's hot and fresh the food is even better. \n\nI love the feel of the restaurant, too. It's perfect for what it is- a tiny, authentic, hole-in-the-wall restaurant. I love that it's tiny, that it sometimes has cockroaches running around (though I do hope they're not actually in the food - never in my experience), it's hot and fast-paced and loud. \n\nI have never had an order I didn't like at Thai Tom's. Their best dish, in my opinion, is the Swimming Rama. Highly recommended!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}
