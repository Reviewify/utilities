I love the employees here - they treat everyone as if they're family. Always lots of joking, and NOISE! Their homemade salsa is PHENOMENAL and the best part is that it comes with a basket of chips for free! Their food is also pretty good and decently priced. My friends go here once a week. Their margaritas are pretty much the BEST in town. They have every flavor you can imagine and you can pretty much get it in any size. A true staple of Blacksburg, VA. We college kids LOVE this place. It's also a good place to bring family earlier in the day. I just wouldn't recommend taking them Thursday - Saturday night because the place is packed with students getting their maragrita fix before they hit the bars.", "business_id": "K4Sq3cz0-73HWS14K6I6Ng", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-05-03", "type": "review"}
