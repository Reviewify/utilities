Of course I was feeling fat, but still wanted to go shopping anyway. Their decor lured me in.  I'm glad I did, since I love this store! Not sure if it's fair for me to have the judgment, giving I've only been there once and gotten 2 dresses but still, I love it.  I walked in thinking that it was going to be super expensive, but the prices were very reasonable. I think my two dresses came out to be $80ish. I love the colors, the style, the ruffles on a lot of their stuff, the drop waist tunics/dress, chiffon, belts, etc. Their accessories are also really cute, but I forced myself to leave since I probably would have spent another hour in there.  The girls that work there are nice and helpful.", "business_id": "SHbmDqYKaJwSHyl3vWwR8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-15", "type": "review"}
