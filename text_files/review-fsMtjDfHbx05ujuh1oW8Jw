I have been going here for about 6 years and it is always one of my first thoughts when someone says \"Where do you want to go tonight?\". Not only do they mix TERRIFIC cocktails, with a nice little nod to the old fashioned drinks, but they make amazing food.\n\nThe Gouda skillet is the stuff of dreams, totally artery clogging concoction of cream, smoked Gouda, onions and garlic, served in a cast iron skillet with  toast to scoop the gooey deliciousness up. My friends and I are always fighting over scraping the skillet clean. Once they removed it from the menu, and when I cried to the waitress she said \"You know, we need to get into bathing suits too\". It's that good.\n\nThe crowd is a mix  of neighborhoodies, after work crowd and an artsy-musician crowd. \n\nThe Red Sox are on. The music is solid. There are free eggs on the bar. What more can a girl ask for?", "type": "review", "business_id": "qnRO5swUiQ2dNHuHRbAIzg"}
