I ordered the Manhattan burger, which is 1/2 lb, comes with avocado, bacon, and fries. The burger was cooked medium and not dry. \n\nService is relatively fast. The seating is kind of cramped and there are only high seats.\n\nTL;DR; Give this place a try as it's really cheap. 1/2 lb burger with drink and side for 7.50.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WSTdK7y1ZDw9JU3NUpFj7g"}
