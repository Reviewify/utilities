I ordered the Manhattan burger, which is 1/2 lb, comes with avocado, bacon, and fries. The burger was cooked medium and not dry.  Service is relatively fast. The seating is kind of cramped and there are only high seats. TL;DR; Give this place a try as it's really cheap. 1/2 lb burger with drink and side for 7.50.", "business_id": "WSTdK7y1ZDw9JU3NUpFj7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-26", "type": "review"}
