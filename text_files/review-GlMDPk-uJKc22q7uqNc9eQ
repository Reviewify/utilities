Perhaps it was old when they cooked it?  I've taken a small break from this place, just in case. I've also had the Fried Chicken, which is also really good. I really like the steamed rice that comes with the meals, and the pickled cabbage. The few bubble drinks I've had have been really tasty. The taro smoothie is my favorite, it's delicious. I also like the cookies and cream smoothie, although recently they haven't been making it with cookies. It used to be that my shake would have cookie crumbs over the top. Now it's just a chocolate milk smoothie. I asked the cashier about it the last time I ordered one, and she assured me it comes with cookie crumbs. I should ask every time, because they added cookie to it this time! Overall, it's good for the price, I just hope they don't raise their prices again!", "business_id": "Phqwjk7x11WMAd-rVGbY0A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-15", "type": "review"}
