There was a decent crowd and the service was fast. We were seated immediately, as the service was very attentive. \n\nWe ordered the Korean BBQ platter and it came with short rib, beef, pork and chicken (which we substituted instead of getting the squid). It was all delicious, but the chicken and beef were my favorites! The chicken had just the right amount of spice and the beef was sooo tender! The portion was very big, we couldn't finish our food! \n\nI would definitely recommend checking it our if you are in the Columbia area!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DgHEzcSBotbfxW-IJPAMuQ"}
