I'm there!\n\nWhether its clothes, food, or entertainment, I love a good deal. My co-worker took me to the Academy 6 Theater and it felt like I've been introduced to a whole new world (I exaggerate a bit). I've been down Colorado many times, but for some reason I have never noticed this place. Sure, inside the actual theater, its a little sketchy, but what do expect? You're only paying 2 freakin dollars. Its seems like they show movies that have come and gone at other theaters, but I saw Paper Heart here, around the same time it was released.\n\nIts cash only, but what do you expect, its $2. They lobby and video game center could totally use a face lift, but what do you expect, its $2. There is free parking around the corner, but the lot fills up fast, so you might have to look for street parking. But what do you expect? Its $2.\n\nDid I mention that its 2 freakin' dollars?", "type": "review", "business_id": "g-D-YFkxy0SdtN2-bk8fcA"}
