It's a close competition, but the tzatziki is my favorite of the trio with its tangy intensity. The pita is some of the best I've had. It's thick, fluffy, buttery, chewy. Perfect. Order extra pita to go with the dips and you've got a meal already; I'm always too full to eat my entree after splitting the appetizer. The lunch plates I've gotten thus far haven't been too memorable unfortunately, so I can't remember enough to give a review of them other than to note that the vegetables are always fresh. I've always avoided baklava because I thought it too sweet and sickly, but after a cautious nibble on the complimentary baklava that came at the end of the meal and the happy devouring that followed, I can also say that Continental makes the only baklava I've ever enjoyed. The service is warm and prompt and they give you charming carafes of water so you don't have to worry about waiting for refills yay!", "business_id": "798-eBr6EdOJktDT74fj2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-31", "type": "review"}
