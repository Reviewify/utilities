The food is pretty good during the day, but the best time is at night.  The drinks are strong and well priced.  It can get really crowded and it's not worth waiting in line for the bathroom, which crowds the hallway.  The best part is the back patio, it's nice and open, lots of chairs and tables if you can get one, and people just seem more interesting there compared to other bars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "P_J9-_UVjX3uhv1Sas9Kaw"}
