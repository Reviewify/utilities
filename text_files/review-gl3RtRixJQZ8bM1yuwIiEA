It was around midnight and I was in the mood for a falafel which I haven't had in a while. I checked out the reviews for this place and they didn't look too terrible so I tried it. Wow amazingly bad. The falafel balls must have been sitting around for hours. They were absolutely stale and tasteless as was everything else in this horrible concoction. I thought I might get sick but I didn't. That's the only positive thing I can say about this place. I think this might be the worst falafel I've ever had. Actually there is a great place for totally fresh falafels in Harvard Square at Clover just a couple of blocks away.", "business_id": "YeRXjIzxc9FaK6uyrTBvkQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-22", "type": "review"}
