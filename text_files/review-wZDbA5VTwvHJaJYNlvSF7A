I haven't been to this place in a year, and last weekend I was reminded by why. The pizza was not good to me. It was just blah. Went to go and wash my hands and the bathroom was filthy. I mean filthy. We decided to sit outside, hoping we'd get away from the chatter, but no. \n\nTwo college kids followed us to these other tables and were busy running their mouths about people walking about and obviously going to parties. I know that we were outside but I don't want to hear your conversation. Annoying. Plus the tables hadn't been cleaned in like all day. \n\nI will not be returning for a long time.\n\nOh, yeah, I DID not like the pizza.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bSWL0YxfawjS03_g2kgujA"}
