We were always treated with the utmost care and respect throughout the course of our visits, labor, and post-partum. I was lucky to be allowed to take my time and deliver my baby here without any rush to speed things up with pitocin etc. as I might have in a hospital setting. Breastfeeding was a success, in part because of the lactation consultants and the pro breastfeeding ethos of the center.\n I very much disagree with the previous reviewer about cleanliness. The place has always been impressively clean during my visits, especially considering that it is a home-like setting and not a hospital. It is clearly not a good fit for the previous reviewer (he was bemoaning the lack of OBs and epidurals etc).  They are equipped with oxygen, IVs etc in case of emergency and I always felt safe and comfortable. Highly recommended!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HSDHJ_OxTJOfTTjsVypAVQ"}
