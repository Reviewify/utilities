What I got was an cute, elderly lady who reminded me of my maternal grandmother and seemed almost scared to cut my hair. I hadn't realized that \"trim\" meant \"cut my hair with the utmost apprehension!\" Silly me.\n\nWhile I'm sure she meant well, I was a bit annoyed that she would cut about a half-inch here and there, then ask if everything was okay every two seconds. It's fine, lady! I just wanted three inches taken off! That shouldn't take so long! JUST CUT MY HAIR.\n\nThey might do better with actual haircuts and styling and all that, but I'm not planning on going back to find out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YaUEjuu5q8lKE2nl0QbTmQ"}
