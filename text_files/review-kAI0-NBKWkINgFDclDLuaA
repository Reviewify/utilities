It's so cheap and convenient for college students. The staff here are pretty fast, so even if the line is out the door, it shouldn't take too long. Why the four stars when the average is at a two? If you've been to the Subway in downtown, you would give this place a four too. They should be about the same since they are a chain and so the food quality is the same. Because their fast service, they tend to put more condiments in my sandwiches. My sandwich is more filling than the one on Shattuck makes. Cheap, fast, filling... that's pretty much all you need as a college student.", "business_id": "4b8yMxZ5p4KddENZYmjMEg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-13", "type": "review"}
