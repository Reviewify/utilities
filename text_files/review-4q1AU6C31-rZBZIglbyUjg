Gone are the warm wood tones and in are the grey and steel. It's not a bad thing, a fresh look is needed when you take over a well known place. We happened to come upon this place on a Wednesday night. Why mention the day of the week you ask? Because it was half off bottle of wine night! Score! So of course we picked the cheapest Malbec and had a nice little time with our $15 bottle o' wine! The menu looked pretty good, with some tempting dishes, so I went with the Cioppino. It came out with massive pieces of shrimp, clams, mussels and halibut nestled in the middle. The thing that really made the dish was the spicy tomato broth. It tasted awesome with the whole dish and throw in the garlic crostini to soak up the sauce was awesome! At $23 it was well worth it for the amount of seafood you get! I'd for sure stop in again, probably on a Wednesday because this girl likes a deal... and some wine!", "business_id": "GAmd3nHx5TInVN26PLZj7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}
