That's probably the best way to describe a slice of Koronet. This is by no means the best pizza in New York, but for $3.50 a slice, it gets the job done. There aren't many pizza places in Morningside Heights, but this is the best and most convenient location (take the 1 to 110th can't miss it). A slice of cheese can be a little plain, and for that there's toppings like pepperoni, sausage, and even broccoli. This is the favorite late night (drunk) food for many Columbia students, but lines never last long. It's a cash only place, but there's plenty of banks with ATMs around.", "business_id": "A46G2OAvLxFswiONB50Rrg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-18", "type": "review"}
