Silly cheap fresh food with great service. Your waiter will probably be a-won (not sure of the spelling) who is a pleasure to deal with. Hunan shrimp is my favorite, amazing for 8.95.  Shrimp roll appetizer from the Vietnamese menu,  fresh and healthy made with basil and a side of shredded carrots/radish 3.95.  also recommend the seafood pancake 8.95.   Lo mein/ rice dishes run around $7.   Get to know the staff and owner as all are wonderful people.  BYOB , WIFI and free parking in the back just put this place over the top. Cash only.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CwuNdisuchgoMQJmXslH-A"}
