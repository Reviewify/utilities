We went there for breakfast/lunch. There chicken fried steak was from ground beef, so it was more along the lines of chicken fried meatloaf but tasty. The items that were really good were their deep fried pork chops and biscuits. The chops had a light but flavorful batter while remaining moist on the inside. Their biscuits were pretty good especially with butter. One major downfall was my wife had a dead baby roach in her water glass. DISGUSTING!", "business_id": "ResTVefi8Km1RpTuWkqFvw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-02", "type": "review"}
