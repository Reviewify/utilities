It only took a few minutes of wandering around Lyon Center to find the truck. As it was 12pm, there was a short line that allowed me to debate between the many, many options listed on the truck. I finally decided on a chicken burrito, while my friend got a panini, and both were so good. Unhealthy, for sure, but delicious. For about $5, the portions were also big enough for our orders to serve as two meals--always a plus for college students!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4i7z1ttEkRTFlhYLtUhJiw"}
