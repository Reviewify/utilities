(*ba-da-bum* i'm here all week, folks.) anyhow, he said it wasn't a problem to change it. the girl took the lamb back and made a pita wrap for me, replete with all the toppings that i didn't want before i could explain that by \"plain\" i had meant \"just meat.\" she made me another, but boy, did she not look happy about it. i don't blame her, but come on, i already felt like an idiot! \"next time, you'll know,\" the guy reassured me. \"yeah, right,\" i thought. \"like i'm coming back after i made an ass of myself.\" except i got home and tasted the lamby goodness, and i think i may be addicted. maybe i can disguise myself on a return visit...", "business_id": "01xOhO708S2F_ONq4wLFXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-02-23", "type": "review"}
