Ambiance is bland, and street parking sucks. However, the food is pretty tasty. I was having a serious craving for some lamb last night and Pita! Pita! came to mind as the nearest Greek-ish place. I guess I was confused regarding a pita versus a gyro. I thought they were pretty much the same thing, but apparently not. Also, Pita! Pita! is not Greek. I drove over, walked in, and checked out the menu. I asked the girl behind the counter, \"So, do you sell gyros?\" She gave me a blank look. There was a picture of some sort of wrap that looked close enough to what I had in mind, so I asked for the lamb roast, plain, with tzatziki. \"Tahini?\" she replied. \"Um, sure!\" I said. This should have been my first clue that I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I like tahini, so I figured she was just trying to up-sell me with a side. A couple of minutes later, she handed me a bag and I walked out. I opened the bag in my car and found a styrofoam container of lamb, along with some tahini sauce and pita chips, but no wrap. I walked back in. \"I don't think this is what I ordered,\" I said. There was a guy behind the counter and I explained to him that I was trying to get a gyro. \"Oh, she didn't know what that was,\" he said. So, apparently, my question was Greek to her. (*ba-da-bum* I'm here all week, folks.) Anyhow, he said it wasn't a problem to change it. The girl took the lamb back and made a pita wrap for me, replete with all the toppings that I didn't want before I could explain that by \"plain\" I had meant \"just meat.\" She made me another, but boy, did she not look happy about it. I don't blame her, but come on, I already felt like an idiot! \"Next time, you'll know,\" the guy reassured me. \"Yeah, right,\" I thought. \"Like I'm coming back after I made an ass of myself.\" Except I got home and tasted the lamby goodness, and I think I may be addicted. Maybe I can disguise myself on a return visit...", "business_id": "01xOhO708S2F_ONq4wLFXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-02-23", "type": "review"}
