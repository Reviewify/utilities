Did take out again for time saving reasons....chicken parm was so overcooked the chicken was rubbery and ended up throwing out most of it and in our house chicken parm never goes to waste whether it's ordered out or homemade. Ordered mozzarella sticks with the meals and they completely forgot to put them in the order, but the only shining light was at least we didn't get charged for them. So second time was definitely not the charm and I don't think there will be a 3rd.", "business_id": "POL04pXVtUJ4aQguvZF_Pg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-28", "type": "review"}
