The ingredients are much higher quality than you typically get at a cheap chinese place.  The lunch combos are a great deal at $6.  The tangy and spicy is my personal favorite.  Also be sure to try their eggrolls.  They are some of the best I have had at a restaurant.  \n\nI think that the hot and sour soup is overrated, but I am not a huge fan of that soup to begin with.  The portions are large, the staff is friendly, and they have live music most nights.  There used to be a piano player during lunch, but I haven't seen him around in a while.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cHnEZ6-BeQRlxFiF--sBcA"}
