Just couldn't wait to leave this review, so I am typing on my blackberry.  WORST sushi place EVER!!!\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to look for a place on Telegraph for a quick dinner.\n\nFirst impression, place is really big and a bit dark, sushi restaurant? sports bar? KTV? Anyways, we sat down.\n\nOnly one waitress there, she had no idea what is good on the menu, couldn't make any suggestion. Maybe she is new, it is fine....\n\nWe ordered Lion King, una mountain roll, and G roll.  Took them forever to bring the first two orders, and the lion king came half cold! I guess they pre-made the lionking, whenever someone orders, they just toss it in the oven, and no one cares to check the time after it is in oven?\n\nWhile we were waiting for the G-roll, check came.  I checked the bill, G roll is on there, only 2 orders showed up. Fine, I just want to cancel the third order. Then the waitress came back and said they made it already, she will bring it right out. Nope! didn't happen 10 minutes later.\n\nMajor Disappointment!  I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NgwqZNamI-NyBMfiIadWCA"}
