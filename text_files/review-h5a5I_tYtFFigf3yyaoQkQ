This place is amazing, not only because of the prices and selection, but because of the joy of supporting your local public library. The selection is equally fascinating and the volunteer staff really are phenomenal. They don't care if you are there for hours and have laughed with joy at my $60 piles of books (usually about 50-60 books at that price!) Also, the books are eccentric and often come with free ephemera. One of my favorites was a copy of Kaethe Weingarten's Common Shock with a note from Kaethe to a well-known local author tucked in the pages.", "business_id": "wL8CsvVRuwxfvZP_fW8Osw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-26", "type": "review"}
