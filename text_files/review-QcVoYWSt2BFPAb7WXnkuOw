So after my friend compared Gushi as better version of Yoshinoya I simply had to check it out.\n\nI ordered the beef bowl and got a huge box of rice with sweet strips of beef and sauteed onions and peppers.  I paid for one meal ($6.50) but got 3 meals out of it.  Huge!  The beef was tender and the veggies were still crunchy, which I love.\n\nEven though the quality of the food is a lot higher than Yoshinoya, it pretty much stops there.  You have to deal with sitting outside or take it to go.  Remember that it's CA$H ONLY.  There is an ATM right next to it but it wasn't working during my visit so just come prepared.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g-B5qeJ0V9mTKrM9Ekr7BA"}
