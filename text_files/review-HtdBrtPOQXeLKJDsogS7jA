Unfortunately, my experience was meh.  Maybe I'd set my expectations too high. It's a nice cozy atmosphere, but the food wasn't that good.  The crab wonton appetizer was tasty, but it's kind of hard for fried food to not be good when it's a treat for someone who usually tries to eat healthy. The duck rolls were unmemorable.  Lastly, the spicy eggplant with scallops dish was disappointing. I am a huge fan of eggplants and scallops and the description of this item on the menu sounded like a dream, but I was let down by reality.  I am used to big, slippery scallops that melt in my mouth but the ones at Daisy Mint had a texture resembling chicken.  I guess they were frozen or overcooked or both.  The sauce on the entree was good, but the eggplants were so drenched in it that they were too salty to eat unless mixed liberally with rice. Oh well.", "business_id": "oSMpVfjLeSDV2yZzNH0rKw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-14", "type": "review"}
