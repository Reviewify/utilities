I ordered butter chicken to go and the flavors were close to the tikka, but sweeter; the tikka had slightly more complex flavors so it was my favorite (at three stars neither was very spicy). Each dish fed me for three meals each, so I was stoked - what a deal. The rice, garlic naan, and chai are delicious too. I look forward to visiting this place again, and again.", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-30", "type": "review"}
