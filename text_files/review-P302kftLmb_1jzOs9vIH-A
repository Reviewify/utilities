One cool thing about the place is they usually give you more food if you speak Spanish. Keep that in mind if you know the language. There are so many better Mexican options.

You will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "7x0i0seshwLXBVAam16wuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-22", "type": "review"}
