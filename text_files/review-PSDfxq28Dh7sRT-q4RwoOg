The strawberry pie really just lets fresh, delicious strawberries shine; there's not just else to that pie, but that is quite okay. But you must must must get this topped with their fresh whipped cream. \n\nOkay folks, their whipped cream deserves a paragraph of its own. Normally, I hate whipped cream. I think whipped cream is gross, with it's fluffed up slimy texture. But oh boy oh boy, this is the REAL stuff. Get it. You won't regret it.\n\nI've also had the coconut cream pie and banana cream pie, and you HAVE to get one (or both) of these too! The custard in these pies is absolutely amazing, I never wanted to stop shoveling it into my mouth. But alas, I would get too fat, and would not be able to leave my house. \n\nBring a friend and split a few pies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q"}
