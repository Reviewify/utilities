The pizza was so oily, I thought someone poured chili oil over it.  When I picked up a slice, the oil made its way down to the pointy end of the pizza and dripped onto my plate.  I'm not gonna lie... I still ate it and thought it was totally edible, but I wouldn't say it was good.  For $14.50, I'd rather get a large pizza from Papa Johns.  At least it comes with the garlic dip on the side.\n\nGo if you're in the mood for cheap, edible Italian.  If you're looking for Italian to knock your socks off, keep looking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qIwISTsz_2DXVqEfuTDYng"}
