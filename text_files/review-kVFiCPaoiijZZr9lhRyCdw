The midtown setting is perfect.  I found it to be friendly, well-decorated, quiet, and chic.\n\nI guess we were some of the few that made it past the appetizers, meats, and cheeses to the entrees.  I can see why so many people would go just for wine and apps though.  It is a very relaxed environment, and I love the open kitchen.  \n\nWe tried the fried goat cheese with honey and black pepper, and like most people, thought it was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.  My friend got the chili-braised pork with garlic and pappardelle (well-spiced, unique dish).  I got the Duck Fricassee with prunes, shallots,  and frisee (fantastic duck, well prepared).\n\nFor dessert, we got a chocolate something on shortbread with strawberries.  Ok, all I remember is chocolate and good.  \n\nBut honestly, the service was great and it should be on your list of Atlanta restaurants to try at least once.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rP90TP7gOMzBFTrKWEEsOw"}
