The midtown setting is perfect.  I found it to be friendly, well-decorated, quiet, and chic. I guess we were some of the few that made it past the appetizers, meats, and cheeses to the entrees.  I can see why so many people would go just for wine and apps though.  It is a very relaxed environment, and I love the open kitchen.   We tried the fried goat cheese with honey and black pepper, and like most people, thought it was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.  My friend got the chili-braised pork with garlic and pappardelle (well-spiced, unique dish).  I got the Duck Fricassee with prunes, shallots,  and frisee (fantastic duck, well prepared). For dessert, we got a chocolate something on shortbread with strawberries.  Ok, all I remember is chocolate and good.   But honestly, the service was great and it should be on your list of Atlanta restaurants to try at least once.", "business_id": "rP90TP7gOMzBFTrKWEEsOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-06", "type": "review"}
