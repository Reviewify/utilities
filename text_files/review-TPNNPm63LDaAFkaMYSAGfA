If you only need an annual examination and shots, go to The Humane Scoiety (and make a donation!). If you have an emergency, go to the VCA Castle Shannon Animal Hospital. For everything else, try the Cat Clinic. A day before a recent trip, my cat began behaving erratically. Because I live near the Cat Clinic and they had a same-day appointment available, I went there. I waited 40 minutes past my appointment time and I didn't appreciate Dr. Bebko's \"doom and gloom\" comments. I won't be returning if I can help it.", "business_id": "jYJJT8c2opTGBzfTvSYFFA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-15", "type": "review"}
