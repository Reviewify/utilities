Don't get me wrong, the food goes down fine, whether it be your Walnut Crusted Camambert or Calamari Flowers appetizers, or your Papardelle or Lamb!\n\nThe issue is more around finer details. A request for rare meat came out as medium. The pasta was too saucy and under spiced with chicken that could have used better marination.\n\nWine selection was also drab, though we did manage to find a fairly good Pinot from Rodney Strong Estates in California. We asked for a decanter and received \"nicer\" glasses as well. I found that odd, as if unless you ask, you don't get the quality glassware! Note on the wine: it definitely opens up nicely.\n\nThe service was average yet friendly. We were at one point told that we may need to vacate our table prior to the second seating, and I found that to be unnecessary. Otherwise, good enough.\n\nGiven it's Waterloo, I'd say I'd likely try this place again in the future to see if my first impressions were accurate or misguided. Try for yourself as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tCHzMY3WnCxw2lHvnMcXFA"}
