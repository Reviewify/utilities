The menu went upscale, as did the prices, but mistakes and questionable decisions were virtually omnipresent.  The burgers are small and dwarfed by a comically  large and not particularly well chosen bun.  The seafood soup bread-bowl is disappointingly bland.  The mac and cheese is chewy and quite deficient in cheese.  And one of my fellow diners was served raw pork.  In a party of 6 people, not one would even consider going back for dinner. The Drinks: Awesome--if and only if you like bourbon.  That's really the only reason to go.", "business_id": "CqU7SXYRo9EbMwlxrSvErA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-01-22", "type": "review"}
