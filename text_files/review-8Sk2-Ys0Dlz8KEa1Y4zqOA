Food: Really great Brioche French Toast--light and with a great taste, comes with real maple syrup. Service: Very attentive. Value: The french toast was $9 which is pretty standard but some of their other things are pretty expensive like Oatmeal for $7 ($8.50 if you want fresh fruit!) Atmosphere: I LOVE the outside. The inside is fine too and just looks like your typical diner. Conclusion: Great breakfast and outdoor seating with a generally good value.", "business_id": "KG3Y2qyrru2SZxR_c5gHyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-23", "type": "review"}
