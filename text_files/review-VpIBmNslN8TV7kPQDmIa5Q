What they lose stars for is the actual beer they brew.  I was in the mood for a dark beer, hoping for a stout, so we happened into Two Rows hoping that with the fall would come some dark beer offerings from the brewmasters at Two Rows.  We were wrong.  There were six or seven beers on the menu, and they were all light colored, blonde ales.  Now I wasn't going to give up just because there was no stout to be found (I can always go downstairs into Baker St or across the street to Ginger Man).  No, we were determined to drink Two Rows beer and like it.  The first one we tried was an IPA, not bad, not great, c'mon this is homebrew right?  It should knock my freaking socks off, I should not be wondering whether they might have a St. Arnolds I could switch to, but I kind of wanted one, their Octoberfest is rocking.   By the third beer we ordered, sorry I forget names, what was yours again?  I was ready to go.  Feeling unfulfilled and still on the trek for a dark beer I decided to cave in and go buy some commercially crafted masterpieces from Ginger Man.  I did notice on the menu at the bar that they have some pretty sweet happy hour prices, at $1 a pint, I don't care how it tastes, I'll convince my body that it is homebrew bliss.   Hoping they switch up their beer offerings and bring some dark stouts or porters in soon, I'll be back routinely to check, I mean, just walk down the flight of stairs and across the street if you're unhappy.", "business_id": "1jf4fZV8IdsRy9yjhAix9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-03", "type": "review"}
