I asked for black beans in my burrito and when the guy who assembled my burrito put pintos in, the initial guy who took my order definitely looked me in the eye, knowing it was wrong/checking if I was paying attention, but decided not to remedy the situation if I didn't complain, which I didn't. Still, he should've at least asked me if it was okay instead of simply hoping I wouldn't notice. They also messed up my friend's order. Sounds silly, but the cleanliness and newness of the space seems unnatural and also does not agree with the small, greasy Gordo's of my childhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "s3aJzSKD-tBGR0MNGw_sDw"}
