He's a local restaurant owner, so we in there choppin it up. I'm looking around for Tommy Lee, he's nowhere to be found to screw things up. Thank GOD. But that mean muggin chick with attitude is working the register again. There is also a new girl barista, she seem like she had a sweet disposition. Well she took my order and made my drink as the other chick looked away, pretending to be busy. I'm like ok! So then I just say what's on my mind to the new barista. I'm like thank you for being so polite and nice, because every time I come in here these damn people seem like they got an attitude. If this chick over here ain't rolling her eyes, the drinks suck, always something with this place! Nobody told these people to work for Starbucks, you hate it get another damn job cause I'm tired of coming in here lookin at you too. (Glaring at the chick who was mean muggin and refused to take my order) Oh yes I did! So the barista just starts laughin, like Girl I feel you! So she gives me a Grande instead of a tall and for ONCE the Soy Vanilla Chai tasted right. My buddy is at the table by the window crakin' up. This place is too close to my everyday whereabouts for me to be driving out of my way. I'LL BE BACK....", "business_id": "6-hG8T9_L7T3Y212g-hQQg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-27", "type": "review"}
