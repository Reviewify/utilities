Sure, it's not what I'm used to back in the West Coast or my mom, but it's alright for collegetown. The cotton candy you can get yourself is also a plus.\n\nHowever, if you want some decent Korean food, come here. It's around a 4 star quality. Also, Four Seasons which is just around the bend is actually pretty good too, and cheaper. Take your pick. \n\n-1 Star for rudely asking for us to leave as soon as we had started leaving", "type": "review", "business_id": "XJfCTnV3W9SUkTh_3ddxkQ"}
