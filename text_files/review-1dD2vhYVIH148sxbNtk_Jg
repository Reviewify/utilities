Today was the day.\n\nThe portions are large to say the least. For the appetizer I tried the gogi. In the future I will ask for less lettuce but I loved that they included jalapenos. I will order this again. The sesame fries are a must have. They were so good I actually crave them.\n\nBy the time I finished them (I could only eat 1/4 ) I had a bite of each taco, one shrimp and one tilapia.\n\nGreat place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oOjuZqUGe_JZLrO0b4XTpA"}
