Now I know why. When I went here, the line wasn't as long. I lucked out. It was only about a 10-15 minute wait. I got a dozen cupcakes of different flavors. I tried the strawberry and velvet flavor so far and if i were to choose a favorite between the 2 of them, I would choose the strawberry flavor.  The cupcakes weren't too sweet which I like but wouldn't have too often since they are high in calories.  The frosting itself probably gave me a whole day's worth of calories! all in all I had a good experience here. They sell pupcakes there, so maybe next time I go i'll buy my dog a pupcake.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-10", "type": "review"}
