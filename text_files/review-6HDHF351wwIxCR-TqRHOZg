It's walking distance from where I was staying, and had it stayed open later, I would have likely ended up here more often. I got caramel, tiramisu, pistachio, and milk and honey. Four macarons shared between two people = enough dessert for dinner and breakfast the next morning (don't judge!). Not to mention, the owner is a super nice guy who chatted with me about SF and Philly while preparing the macarons. Why can't we have macaron trucks a few blocks from my apartment???", "business_id": "fK_Fd8-KmGV-ASIIjJwfdQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-18", "type": "review"}
