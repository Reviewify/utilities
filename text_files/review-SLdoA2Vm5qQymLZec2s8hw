It is definitely not a spot I would run to for some really good food. I had the empanadas sampler which was the highlight of my meal (spinach and chicken). They were tasty. For dinner I had the chicken and rib combo which was nothing special. I love sangria and they had the worse I have ever tasted. I have bought sangria in a bottle that tasted much better. After one sip, my friend and I returned our sangrias and switched to margaritas. Those were better but not the greatest. Happy hour price was $5 a glass. I will not be returning to this restaurant because there are much better places.", "business_id": "-AQJhfna4qcxfDnCGx_yLA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-09", "type": "review"}
