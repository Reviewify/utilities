I went with a group from work and we arrived around noon. We were seated quickly, but right near a speaker blaring, yes blaring, music. We could barely hear ourselves talk.  Our waiter took our order and then informed us that a large group just placed their orders, so there would be a wait. Really? Are you that understaffed that you can't handle more than 30 people in a restaurant at once???  Needless to say, we waited a REALLY, REALLY long time. The waiter never offered us a discount, salad, bread, or anything else as compensation for our wait. The food came and it was far from spectacular. I ordered the Portabella Panini and it wasn't  anything I couldn't have made at home. OK, definitely not great, and not worth waiting over an hour for lunch. :(", "business_id": "nh1-ax9wPNCqskcJYIWogg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-28", "type": "review"}
