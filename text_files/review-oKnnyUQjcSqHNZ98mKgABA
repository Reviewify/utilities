What a fun way to eat! I often come here with my partner and we slowly order tapas until we're full. Some of our favorites are the clams in white wine and lemon, the garlic braised greens with walnuts, blue cheese and sherry vinegar, and their warm chocolate souffle with chocolate ganache. Other memorable tapas have included such yummy treats as a chanterelle and black trumpet mushroom bread pudding, arancinis with ricotta salata and sauteed sole in a sorrel cream sauce. \n\nDuring the warmer months, I adore dining on Just a Taste's back patio by candlelight under two gorgeous birch trees. I always feel like I am on vacation! \n\nWhat else can I tell you? This place is extremely reasonably priced, has some great flights of wine and some fabulous desserts!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BdpaiSFcwCJKQHV7nhez7g"}
