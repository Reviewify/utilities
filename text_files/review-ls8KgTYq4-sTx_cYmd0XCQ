I went here with my bf and we ordered two pieces of the monkfish liver sushi. They were really generous with the monkfish liver and it was delicious and fresh. \n\nWe also ordered the ceviche roll, the traditional pressed mackarel (the one that is rectangular and boxy), a summer vegetable roll, and an order of the eel avocado. While all our orders were good, the summer vegetable roll blew me away. (Summer Vegetable Roll avocado, oshinko & marinated eggplant, topped with wasabi oil, grape tomato, balsamic vinegar & truffle salt.) The ceviche roll was kind of bland and a little disappointing but it was still good. \n\nRolls were also reasonably priced at about $10-13 for 6-8 pieces. Will definitely be going back and I will definitely be ordering the summer vegetable roll again. So, so good!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SSmHkP0tZ4TKn_YUOEkVUg"}
