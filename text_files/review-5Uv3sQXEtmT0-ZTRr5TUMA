Almond, original, custard. Nom nom nom. They are basically bread with a sweet layer of... something?!? over it. But it's not sticky like a glazed donut. IDK WHAT IT IS!! If you've ever had hokkaido bread, it kind of tastes like that. Asian breads... lololol. Though their rotibuns are good, I wouldn't normally give 4 stars since I've had something similar to it elsewhere.... but +1 star for being by USC. Thank you for giving us a pastry place that is not Spudnuts.. yeesh. Located in the shopping center before the row on Fig, madeleine is like a ruby in the rough (it's not quite a diamond). I did not try any of their drinks yet but my roommate brought back a box of rotibuns and let's just say.... I had more than my fill of them :( They also can cater for events if you are planning something, btw. So bottom line, do yourself a favor and get those rotibuns! They are only $1.50 each and are pretty hearty!", "business_id": "VdTPn_EwEquKWMpm9r-rRQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-27", "type": "review"}
