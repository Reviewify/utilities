Anywhere.\n\nYou'd think with two other Starbuck's within whiffle ball distance would deter the establishments of a 3rd. Alas, I'm glad they did. Right as you leave the Harvard Square T, you encounter this coffee-house monstrosity. It's just like any other Starbucks with one key exception.\n\nThe 2nd floor is one huge, wood-decorated, cozy, power-outlet heavy, wifi-enabled, work / chill / meeting area with a fantastic view of Harvard Square through it's array of floor to ceiling windows.\n\nYou can also get non espresso drinks with no line at the upstairs bar.\n\nThe internet on busy days is shit. I get faster speeds through my phone. At least it's free.\n\nThis is the genre at its finest.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6uc5h32bXZ7dQQ5xOeurnA"}
