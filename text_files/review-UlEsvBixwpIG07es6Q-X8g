I like the basement location and the ~mood lighting~ that's not too dark.\n\nWater glasses were always full.\nWhen we ordered, though, we asked the waiter about the Golden Bags (I think that's what they were called), but he didn't even know where it was on the menu and he wasn't able to explain it without looking at the menu o_o He was friendly though ...\nAnyways, we ordered the Pad See Ew (tofu) and Pineapple Fried Rice. Both were decent. Our waiter actually first gave us Mango Fried Rice by mistake. I had already placed a spoonful on my plate, but he took the plate of mango fried rice AND my plate with the spoon of it to bring back the original order of PFR. That was pretty upsetting because I actually wanted to taste the MFR, haha. There was nothing too memorable about either plate, and I feel like the PSE had a tad bit more soy sauce than necessary.\n\nBoth plates were okay and the service was okay. Okay.\n\nOh yeah. And I think they were too expensive for the amount of food given.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1dGQF0sqCghhOntdkcyycw"}
