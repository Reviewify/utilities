This Starbucks location gets a \"fan\" rating not because of the coffee, but the great service. This Starbucks is a well oiled machine. They've cleared out most of their floor space knowing the majority of their clientele are pick up and go customers. From the many times I've ordered here, it seems they have a good system in place to deal with the heavy traffic that happens sporadically throughout the day. Don't be deceived by the long lines; this Starbucks knows how to handle it. On top of the speedy service, the baristas are also really pleasant. They're nice without being too sugary. I would not recommend going here if you plan on staying a while to study. Finding an empty table is very hit and miss and there's just a lot of traffic. It can get distracting. Overall, a great experience. Props to this Starbucks for knowing how to handle their flow!", "business_id": "dWV41BVCxC30m6HTgRqQZQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-07", "type": "review"}
