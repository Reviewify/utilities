I love a good veggie sub from Subway, but the sight of the shiny meat hanging out behind the sneeze guards makes me want to vomit. Here, the meat is cut fresh for your sub, the bread is freshly baked... in fact, the only thing that's not fresh-looking are the veggies, which is why I give 4 stars. I don't mind paying 6-8 bucks for a quality sandwich, but I don't think a sandwich is just bread and meat and cheese. Also, the only sauce options are oil & vinegar or a specialty sauce on a specialty sandwich - no mustard?! Really? But the meat is quality, so if I want a turkey sandwich in Westwood, this is my best option of the sub shops.", "business_id": "e9CQC0ILYwpmdFqhD6XfhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-22", "type": "review"}
