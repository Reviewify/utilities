I love the bright colors, the multi-patterned look, and the tall enormous ceilings. Also, this place is enormously popular for people looking to do baby showers/bridal showers/any type of lunch-time gathering involving presents. As for me, I took my parents here for brunch (but accidentally came on Saturday - when they don't serve brunch, but that was okay because 3 out of the 4 of us ordered their seriously awesome sirloin burger and my mom got an incredibly good flatbread pizza!) Russ and I also came here recently for Sunday Brunch after my birthday and I got a seriously awesome warm, buttered lobster roll that blew my mind completely. It's not a staple item on the menu, but I'm writing this with the hopes that they'll bring it back. Huge chunks of lobster in a crisp buttered roll with fresh greens - um, nom? Also, as a side note, the waiters here are exceptionally nice. I believe I'll be coming back here again and again because it's consistently a reliable place to go for lunch where there is no line and terrific food.", "business_id": "jI4yOYZ7nZt1Yv_9GolxYg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-22", "type": "review"}
