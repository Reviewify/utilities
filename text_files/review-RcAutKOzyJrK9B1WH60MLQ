It has several ice-cream flavor, but as usual I only eat the plain one. This one is not very tart, and is a little bit toooo plain--I mean, not much flavor. But interestingly, they have the fig topping, which I think it's rare. But it's not that tastful, a little bit dry. I think I still prefer the self-service fro-yo.
