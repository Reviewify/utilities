This is my FAVORITE food place in College Park, after spending nine years of undergraduate and graduate existence experimenting when I had a few bucks to eat with. It's the Chinese version of Marathon Deli: a little hole in the wall with absolutely fantastic food at excellent prices that are literally half what places in DC charge. \n\nI came for the daily specials, my favorite by far being Tuesday's Chicken with Black Bean Sauce. The portions are ultra-generous, and the special cost about $5. My other favorites included Kung Pao Chicken Chinese Style and Double Cooked Pork. Everything there was simply delicious, including the micro dumplings with their fantastic sauce. \n\nThe lady behind the counter, who loved watching Chinese movies on a portable DVD player, was friendly enough despite the language barrier (her English is limited), and recognized me a regular after I'd only been there about six or seven times. The only significant downfall: cash only. In this Age of Plastic, that is something of a limitation. \n\nThis is the place I miss the most about College Park, now that I no longer study or work there. A real local treasure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "S24JsVLP-xcBYKrMGMzbCg"}
