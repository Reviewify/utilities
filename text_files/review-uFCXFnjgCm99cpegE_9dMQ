We ordered Chicken Chow Mein, Orange flavored chicken and Spicy chicken curry - they all tasted the same. Bland. It was as if the food was prepared from one of those ready-made spice mixes - but they still didn't get it right. Don't think we'll be going there again. Also - not accepting credit cards was a pain in the butt! (Bathrooms weren't bad!)", "business_id": "sPd-zQtPSARMw1vx131v1w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-20", "type": "review"}
