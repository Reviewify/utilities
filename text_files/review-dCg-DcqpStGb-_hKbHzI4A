But sadly, it's not. First of all, the menu is overwhelmingly long. I would rather go to a restaurant that does a smaller variety of dishes, but does them very well. If you do go there, I would recommend one of the baked seafood pasta dishes. They stay hot even when you're eating outside. I'd like to give this restaurant a high rating because I am all about supporting local restaurants that aren't chains. However, I was very turned off by the service the last time I was there. There is a very narrow walk way in between tables and I was almost plowed over 3 times by the same worker. We were ignored at the hostess stand and then seated too close to the wall. The wait staff was young and inexperienced. And I was more than a little bothered by them flirting with one another. Very unprofessional, but that's what you get when you hire high-schoolers.", "business_id": "UkHcGDxoCqo2GLcRnU7Q3A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-04-07", "type": "review"}
