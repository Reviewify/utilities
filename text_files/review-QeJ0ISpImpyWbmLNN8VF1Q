So I finally decided to try it out..andthen I came back the following week and took another friend. We all loved it!! We sat at the bar so we can see all the food coming out of the kitchen. The bar is the BEST seat in the house if you have 3 or less people. (so we can see what people were ordering and what looked good!)\n\nThe first visit was a good sampling of their vegetarian items. I was PLEASANTLY surprised as it was really good! I couldn't get enough of the Tofu Lentil Loaf with Miso Mushroom Gravy...Delicious. The texture was like a regular meatloaf and was tasty. I finished the entire dish. I tried both the mashed potatoes and the gingered mashed yams....OMG the yams were sooooo good! The mashed potatoes were good as well..but I preferred the yams! We also tried the Tofu Verde Wrap...ask for extra Tomatillo Sauce..it'll make it much tastier! YUM YUM. \n\nThat was our first meal there and the following week I returned again. The Spicy Napa Salad...wouldn't get it again...there was NO SPICE and felt the flavor lacked a little bit of flavor. However, my friend had the Turkey Burger and raved, the New Bohemia Salad was really tasty as well. \n\nThe service was wonderful! So spot on and very informed about their menu and when I was interested about the decor. Jerome our waiter gave us alot of info! Very cool that they used recycle wood/glass etc very green.\n\nI actually liked the layout of the bathroom because instead of stalls..you get your own bathroom - nice and enclosed! I haven't tried out the market yet..but it actually looked good. I'm thinking of heading there next week!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}
