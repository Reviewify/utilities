They are some of the best I've had, on par with very good patisseries in Paris. 4 Stars for the pastry alone. All of their food is generally quite good. My favorite item is the Robespierre sandwich!! Service is terrible, but I love this place anyway.", "business_id": "QUNchfxuTOOmjAXkHivYdQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}
