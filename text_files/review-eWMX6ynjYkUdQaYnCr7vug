They are some of the best I've had, on par with very good patisseries in Paris. 4 Stars for the pastry alone.\n\nAll of their food is generally quite good. My favorite item is the Robespierre sandwich!! \n\nService is terrible, but I love this place anyway.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QUNchfxuTOOmjAXkHivYdQ"}
