After dealing with all the wack, overpriced places on the drag, this jewel of a yogurt shop opened and has been popping ever since. \n\nIt is cute, clean, local, and reasonably priced. I know people who would drive all the way to the triangle to avoid the icy yogurt at swirl or the overly sweet, overpriced yogurt at yogurt spot. However there is no longer any need. Juicy tart has the best flavors (mango, peach, lychee, etc etc) that always have the best consistency. Their toppings are always fresh and have the good stuff aka mochi balls, fruit jelly, and lots and lots of fruit. \n\nThey always have fun events and sponsor philanthropies for sororities and groups. The staff is so friendly - the owner is Korean ( knows a bunch about making yummy yogurt and running a good business) and has really hired a wonderful staff that is always helpful and efficient. \n\nP.S. Its open until 2 AM! They also have a huge TV and karaoke room. My friends do homework here or just hang out on the deck on the weekends. This really is a wonderful place to get yogurt!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cqb7ACDJ4M3UHzYE-Kpg7w"}
