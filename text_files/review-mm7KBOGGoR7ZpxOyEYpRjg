Dining room area was freezing. Waiter served us water with dingy plastic mugs. That was the only disgrace. I scratched of some of the caked mildew of the plastic mugs. Mugs need to be scrubbed, or better yet they need to be thrown away. Make sure your mugs are clean before you drink. This review very generous.", "business_id": "_1itCzaA3bDVdPSwNCNPtA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-03", "type": "review"}
