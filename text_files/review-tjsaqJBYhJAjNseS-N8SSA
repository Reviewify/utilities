It's a nice, quaint place...Lovely decor: bookshelves full of books, different art pieces hanging on the wall, and a small chandelier hanging above. Oh! There's also patio seating. I really like the feel of this place. It's a great place to have lunch with friends. I loved: Mussels Proven\u00e7ale Seared Tuna Salad with Pear and Sesame Dressing Pork Belly Sandwich Cucumber Lemon Water (Yes, even their water is amazing!) Lamill Coffee I am definitely coming back!", "business_id": "R2-_hZIboGriSatS2kn7rw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-04", "type": "review"}
