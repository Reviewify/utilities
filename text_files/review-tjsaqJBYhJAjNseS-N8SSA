It's a nice, quaint place...Lovely decor: bookshelves full of books, different art pieces hanging on the wall, and a small chandelier hanging above. Oh! There's also patio seating. I really like the feel of this place. It's a great place to have lunch with friends.\n\nI loved:\nMussels Proven\u00e7ale\nSeared Tuna Salad with Pear and Sesame Dressing \nPork Belly Sandwich\nCucumber Lemon Water (Yes, even their water is amazing!)\nLamill Coffee\n\nI am definitely coming back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "R2-_hZIboGriSatS2kn7rw"}
