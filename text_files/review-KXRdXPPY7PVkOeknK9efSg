I saw some bedroom sets that I liked, but they seemed a little expensive for their condition and one of the legs on the couch I liked was bent. I asked the salesman if the couch could be fixed. He said probably not, but that there was another identical couch in the back.\n\nI went back to Cort a few days later. miraculously the bedroom sets were on sale and the couch's leg had been fixed. I was very excited about my new furniture. I would recommend getting furniture there. However, I absolutely recommend NOT USING THEIR DELIVERY SERVICE.\n\nThe delivery service is unprofessional and overpriced!!! I was told delivery was $75 an hour. To me this sounded like this was the price for getting my furniture from truck to my living room, which took (with all their difficulties) about 1.5 hours. The delivery service was really slow (it was basically a man and his extremely inexperienced son, who did not seem very excited about carrying furniture up the stairs in the steamy Boston summer). At the end, the delivery service charged me $200 for the time spent also wrapping and packing the furniture at Cort. If the delivery service had been professional, they probably could have done the same task in half the time.\n\nIf you choose to buy your furniture here, find you own delivery service. For the time and money their delivery service cost, I could have gotten much nicer furniture.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKOqHB5ovo19tQlROC2kjw"}
