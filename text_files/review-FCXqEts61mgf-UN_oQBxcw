We found the service wonderful and the food fresh, local and interesting. The chef is the super nice Christopher Albrecht who came from one of my favorite restaurants ever...Gramercy Tavern in NYC. Faves: Fried Baby Artichokes, Beet and Ricotta Salad, half-orders of any of their handmade pastas and a MUST is the side of mushrooms. Washed down with some good wine and voila....a great experience.", "business_id": "CiS3oaKZpfgXwPjpw-Y1gA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-28", "type": "review"}
