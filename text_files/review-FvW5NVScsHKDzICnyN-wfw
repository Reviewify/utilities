Yes, it's easy to miss if you don't live in the area. But I love it.  If you're going to The Cellar, don't go for the clothes. Go for the adorable and quaint bowls, baskets and beautiful often hand-made blankets. It's perfect if you want to find something antique but in-taste to touch-up your room and at a low price. They do mark down for items that stay around, but if you find something you like don't let it go. It won't be there for long. I resisted temptation from a gorgeous bowl there one weekend, and saw my roommate with it the following Wednesday evening.", "business_id": "lioSQlr49FhIS68nk3VtXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-18", "type": "review"}
