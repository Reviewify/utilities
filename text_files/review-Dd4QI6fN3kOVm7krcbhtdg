It's not bad, it's not incredible... it's okay. The ambiance here has always felt a little stuffy to me, but sometimes you just want a heavy Italian mean, you know? Tonight, we went for Restaurant Week, and were bummed to see that no joy or real effort had been put into their menu. Where Vinology made this creative, daring, fun menu... Gratzi's was predictable and a little boring! For the starter you either got a salad or soup. We got the salad, and it was a normal salad--some greens, one tomato slice, and some shaved parmesan cheese. I did ask for a small taste of the soup (which seemed to absolutely horrify our waitress), and that was pretty good--tomato bisque. For the main meal, I got the salmon over gnocci. Both elements were good, but it was very heavy. We finished eating three hours ago, and I'm STILL overstuffed. It wasn't some huge portion, it was just that loaded with cream. FInally, dessert, this was the biggest bummer of all. You got gelato, sorbet, or a cannoli. Boring! I got the cannoli. It was okay. Nothing to Yelp home about. I actually couldn't even figure out what flavor the filling was. It definitely wasn't ricotta. So... that was that. It's a good meal, but not great. It sure is expensive there, though.. Would I go back? Only if someone else were treating...", "business_id": "MhyCVeRdAlXaCfWlti9GDw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-15", "type": "review"}
