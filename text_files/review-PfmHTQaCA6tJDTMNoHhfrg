The first time the food was mediocre and the service was great.  The second time both the food and the service were sub-par.   On my first visit I had the veggie burger, which was under-seasoned and didn't hold together well.  But the accompanying sweet potato fries were tasty.   On my second visit I had blackened catfish, which came with several sides.  I asked the waitress what was in one of them, and when she told me it included pork, I told her that I didn't eat meat and asked if I could substitute something else.  She obliged.  But when my entree arrived, one of the other sides had large chunks of bacon.  Euw.  My friend had the sweet potato pierogies, which tasted pretty good, but had a strange sticky film covering them, which the waitress couldn't explain. Since my visit I have learned that the Blue Tractor, Cafe Habana, and Grizzly Peak have common owners.  Everything makes sense now.  All three of these places are pretty terrible.", "business_id": "NosYl_9KiDWOGT3YmNmwxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-18", "type": "review"}
