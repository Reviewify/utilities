Pro:  Organization of merchandise is virtually flawless. Con:  Too-cool employees can be a crap shoot when it comes to customer service skills. Pro:  Decently private fitting rooms. Con:  Inflated pricing of some merchandise. Pro:  Close to the Telegraph/Durant parking garage. Con:  Consistently abysmal climate control - it is always 95 effing degrees inside this place. I rarely am in the mood to deal with the whole Telegraph Avenue scene, so my visits to Mars (which in my mind will always be Wasteland) are few and far between - but they remain solid for vintage clothing options.", "business_id": "DjpsMGriV3-HM-mTH2j90g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-02", "type": "review"}
