He gave us great recommendations and was just such a great guy.  It's like we were hanging out with him.  The food is awesome.  I had scallops - amazing!  The waiter had the chef create a special meal for my husband.  He's allergic to peanuts and wanted a certain dish, but the waiter wanted to play it safe so he brought out something not even on the menu.  It was great.  It's pricey, but we thought it was worth it!  Great ambiance, too!", "business_id": "mjJH2IVATkFqWdleRc3dmg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-14", "type": "review"}
