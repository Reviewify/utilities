Maybe for college students this place is the holy grail, but if you have a car then I think you can find better food. The burgers seem to be pan fried and lack any type of grilling flavor. I had a cajun-style burger with andouille sausage. The sausage was a nice touch (first time I've had that). At a little under $5, I suppose the burgers are a good value. We also ordered fries with the ranch dressing dipping sauce. The ranch dressing tasted like the pre-made dressings you'd find in the grocery store (the kind with preservatives and a 10 year shelf life). I guess if you like burgers and fries then this place is a better choice than the local fast food chains.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3jTHc3OEwM5GSfyXzeblFw"}
