The last time I was there, my entire meal was forgotten, as in they forgot to serve me after forgetting the guacamole, reminding them twice, being served someone else's entree, and oops, you're right, we forgot.   The previous time, I had the pleasure of picking hair out of my food.  Finely chopped hair, which made me lose my appetite completely. Sad to see that this place has gone so far downhill over the past year", "business_id": "le-ggzbaqSpm_qN6R8pUoA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-06-21", "type": "review"}
