This place rocks.\n\nThe CA cheesesteak sandwich is easily the best sandwich I have eaten in Westwood, and vies for in the top 5 ever. Substantial strips of actual steak cooked to order + blue cheese = to die for. Their other specialty sandwiches are great too, or you can build your own - with plenty of succulent choices for even the most discerning of palates.\nAs for sides - their garlic curly fries are the stuff of legend and the onion rings are fantastic. Their veggies are also fresh and tasty, no wilted iceberg lettuce here!\n\nThey are a little pricey (but you get a LOT, and the quality is superb), and the atmosphere inside is not the most inviting - but the food is amazing and the outside dining area is a great place to eat and people watch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KGHrM4aF5gWJMW5S7z-xwQ"}
