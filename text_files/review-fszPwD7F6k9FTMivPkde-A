Ikki-con was moved here from the convention center and the location for it is 10 times better. Its right off of Guadalupe and MLK Area. There are resturants all around that are decently priced for food. For the people who love Anime conventions, we all know you save all year around in order to go! So being able to eat cheaply and not fine cuisine is very important.  The hotel staff did a fantastic job in taking care of everyone. With all the people and various age groups, it can get extremely crazy and out of control. It was their first year with is and they could have not done a better job. The staff was very kind and welcoming. I really loved the room set up that my friends had. They were in a corner room with a great view of the UT Tower. I do not believe it was an accessable room but they had a nice walk in shower! It is fantastic. Some of the rooms even have small balconys that look into the court yard! I LOVE the fact that half of the building is the hotel and the other half is the convention center. That have a beautiful courtyard area in the center that everyone took their photos at.  What I really enjoyed about this center that made it great for the type of the convention was the classrooms! When you have tons of people trying to watch and see panels/movies its difficult to see everything with people just have lined seating!  The seating in here was classroom seating but elevated on each step! Its fanastic and a lot of place should do this. (Than again this is part of the UT student area!) Other than all of that. The experience was great. They were wonderful to everyone that I saw and did not mind to much!", "business_id": "2pkPUKKtOkp-pnyCOEz3Og", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-17", "type": "review"}
