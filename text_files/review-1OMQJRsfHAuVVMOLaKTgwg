I am a fan :) I love this place because of their friendly service, delicious treats, and pricing. Pretty reasonable for all you receive. Every store I go to, I receive the same great upbeat service. The last time I visited, they had just closed, but gave my boyfriend and I free \" snicker version\" cup size treats!! How wonderful is that!! It was pretty tasty and I was grateful;) Come by and get your satisfying scoop of heaven!!", "business_id": "NQ_C2IR2Dm4kQZjKmgrS4Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-07", "type": "review"}
