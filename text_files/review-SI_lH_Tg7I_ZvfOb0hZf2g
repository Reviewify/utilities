Not only is this a fun bar to come and have drinks at, but the food's good too. In fact, the menu was much better than I expected. While my boyfriend went with a burger and fries, I opted for the ahi tuna salad which was tasty. I would definitely come back here whether it be for a meal, a drink, or both.", "business_id": "oIgx5AEdeBnsibH7GJc2fg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-23", "type": "review"}
