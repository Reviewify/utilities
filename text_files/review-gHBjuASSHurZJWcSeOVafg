(major boo!) i've eaten there several times, but i constantly find myself asking why i keep eating here, especially since i dont think you get as much as you pay for. i do like that they started putting up pictures of their menu items on the board, so that you can get a visual picture of what your food will look like. (granted they dont always turn out the way the picture looks) decor of the place is definitely cute! a bit fobby at times, but what do you expect? $5 min on credit cards do suck though! so make sure you bring a friend who also wants bubble tea or order food.", "business_id": "Phqwjk7x11WMAd-rVGbY0A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-03", "type": "review"}
