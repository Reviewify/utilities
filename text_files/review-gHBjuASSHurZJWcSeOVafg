Ridiculous crazy days, I wont do that now. But Cocos has won my heart over their bubble tea. Their tapioca balls are just delicious (better than tap house and other boba tea places I've gone to) and sweetened with syrup - maybe that's why. My favorite flavors are taro, blueberry, mango, almond, lychee, strawberry and passionfruit. One thing that I don't like about cocos is that their drinks are ridiculously pricey! They charge extra for boba to be in your drinks too. (Major boo!) I've eaten there several times, but I constantly find myself asking why I keep eating here, especially since I dont think you get as much as you pay for.  I do like that they started putting up pictures of their menu items on the board, so that you can get a visual picture of what your food will look like. (granted they dont always turn out the way the picture looks) Decor of the place is definitely cute! A bit fobby at times, but what do you expect?  $5 min on credit cards do suck though! So make sure you bring a friend who also wants bubble tea or order food.", "business_id": "Phqwjk7x11WMAd-rVGbY0A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-03", "type": "review"}
