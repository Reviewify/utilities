You have very few options in Claremont, let alone the village. I grew up in Claremont and have been to Walters many times. Their food is bland. Reminds me of regular American cuisine w/ a touch of Afghani flare. That being said, their breakfast is like ihop, lunch like chilis, and dinner like a classy version of TGIF. I think you are better off at Heros or the press. Too me, Walters is one of those places where you take out-of-town guests to somewhere \"nice\" in Claremont. It's a nice atmosphere and it's not a chain. But the food is average at best and the prices too high.", "business_id": "ja-xH_xUKBFawH7ZQEeCsw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-09-21", "type": "review"}
