I'll never forget that class. We had aerobics in an un-air-conditioned room in the 90+ degree weather of August and September; and then we had water aerobics at Bowman Gray during the chilly fall-to-winter months of November and December. Despite these logistics, I did enjoy getting to play in the pool some -- even if water aerobics seemed a little more for the 60-and-up crowd. The pool is big. we had one area partitioned for our class; but there are plenty of 50-meter lanes and 25-meter lanes, so you can do some serious laps. I attended an old boyfriend's sister's swim-meet here; it was an all-day affair with several competing teams, but the facility has plenty of space to accommodate that. If you're a student, you can also expect to do your swim-test requirement here (if they are indeed still enforcing that graduation stipulation). The pool is accessible to UNC students and faculty (to the latter for a fee).", "business_id": "aHllSlXi6RCpcwiGkK8UZw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-01", "type": "review"}
