As a bar, it's alright, they actually let the Guinness sit for like twenty minutes to get it right, so kudos on that one, otherwise it's just a run of the mill pub. The place was packed and the patrons were sucking up the air, making it almost a little gross, but the bartender was friendly.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-09", "type": "review"}
