I was skeptical but when I arrived, I knew why people loved their experience at Neil Dahl. Everyone at the shop is really nice and they offer a cold bottle of water while you wait which was perfect for a hot day. The service and customer service was impeccable, I got my platinum ring sized for under 45 minutes (with an appointment) and I got a discounted price! I watched the goldsmith work on my ring the entire time and he was really meticulous with my ring, he made sure that all the diamonds were intact and Neil checked my ring again before he handed to me.", "business_id": "IBz37nHTguMVvSfLQHeZZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-14", "type": "review"}
