My thought was, \"Dude, you can afford the best private chef that money can buy. Better yet, you can take personal classes from Chef Ramsey, and cook your own bombalicious meals. With a limited number of meals in life, why would you come here?\" Then I remembered dessert. So if your into banana desserts, get the fried bananas with coconut ice cream. Aside from galaktobeureko at Evvia, or Havana Bananas at La Bodeguita, it is one of the most delectable sweet concoctions known to man. More than 5 stars. As for the rest of this place: 1. The Wait: Call ahead. The wait is stinking abysmal. Even if you have a reservation, you'll end up waiting outside for a while. Negative stars. 2. The Duck. Every time I come here, someone insists on ordering the peking duck. It's always overcooked. Negative stars. 3. The Drinks. Actually, pretty good. 3 stars. 4. The Double -fried noodles. Very good. 4 stars. 5. The Appetizers. OK. 3 stars. 6. The Prices. Surprisingly good for the haute atmosphere. 4 stars. 7. The Service. Always friendly and accomodating by me. 4 stars.", "business_id": "WWyaK9oskNOpjCsO6MA7Pw", "stars": 3, "date": "2006-08-13", "type": "review"}
