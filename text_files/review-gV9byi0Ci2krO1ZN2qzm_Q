Overpriced, bad food, and to top it off? TERRIBLE service. My friend ordered some type of roll, and she asked they do something different to it. Something minor. So, take a wild guess how many times it came out? Not once, not twice, not even three times...on the FOURTH try it was correct. And every time, the waitress getting increasingly ruder. Finally, before the last time, I asked to have the owner come out, which she did and was somewhat apologetic, but still acted like it was no big deal! I ordered a scallop curry dish. It was strange to say the least, and they cut the scallops in half crosswise! Bizarre, other than they were trying to make it look like my overpriced tiny \"sea\" scallops were worth it. They were the smallest sea scallops I've ever seen. I am from New England, but I am not expecting the same seafood in Illinois, but COME ON! You aren't fooling anyone. I am amazed anyone really thinks this is a 5 star place. It was the worst restaurant experience second only to the time I ate at Miko's...that was worse.", "business_id": "NEVA0IYbawceL6kz5v5DAw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-25", "type": "review"}
