I had the tuna sushi salad and the spicy tuna rice triangle. The salad was really good specially when you put lots of the sauces they serve it with :-) If you like sushi flavor but don't like the seaweed this is the perfect option. The rice triangle is not bad at all and it's kind of big and fulfilling. The price is very decent and the service is not bad at all.....", "business_id": "aJ1iMCVwG-FNzqaGb3g8LQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-12", "type": "review"}
