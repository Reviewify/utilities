Even though I no longer live near, it's worth the trip. I have not eaten in every bagel place in NYC, so I can't say Absolute is the absolute best, but they are absolutely the best I have ever had. Enough silliness. H&H doesn't even come close. Crispy and a little chewy at the same time, and soft inside...and with excellent flavor along with the texture. If you are lucky, you might get there when your favorite variety is hot out of the oven. And that happens often since they bake relatively small batches from one oven about the size of a small pizza store oven, which may be the secret of their great texture. They have loyal employees, as well...another secret of success. One guy recognizes my daughter, now 22, from when I carried her into the store on one arm after daycare every Friday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug"}
