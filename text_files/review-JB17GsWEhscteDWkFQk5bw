Firstly, the spa was so accomodating when we called to schedule appointments for all four of us to recieve one of their spa packages (massage, body wrap, foot treatment, and facial).  When we arrived, they had set aside a small room in the back where we could relax (and have snacks!) between treatments.  The staff were so friendly and professional, and the treatments were amazing.  And to top it off, the prices were very reasonable for the services we received.  My girlfriends were equally impressed, and we're hoping to visit the spa again next year!", "business_id": "RmPofKXO-25wDUtb5TsdKw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-03", "type": "review"}
