I was the most open and 'respectable' place I have seen yet, and the 'stigma' of shady business truly doesn't exist here.\n\nThe selection of edibles was truly amazing, but PRICEY!!!  Wow, I will not make this my main source, even though it is right next to my home. But that said, the cookies I bought are absolutely fabulous tasting, which prompted me to write this review.  The woman behind the counter is an actual herbalist, and while she may not be someone I would enjoy smoking with, she makes for a good doctor.\n\n15% of for first time there.  A MAJOR bonus!\n\n$35 for 4 cookies (4x) is pretty steep, as I buy individual cookies with larger doses (Dr. Feelgood) for a mere $5 at EDEN.  That said, these cookies are much better, smoother, stronger.\n\nBut if your looking for luxury and can afford the steeper prices, this is THE PLACE to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FD0Zazv2AnhI4XzABNwR5g"}
