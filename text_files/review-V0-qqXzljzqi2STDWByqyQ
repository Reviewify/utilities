The pastry chef, when he has his act together, makes astounding desserts. His mousse cakes can be very good. Once, I purchased the most delicious mango mousse cake from him for my roommate's birthday. His tiramisu cake though, leaves much to be desired as all you can taste from it is the alcohol, nothing else. The staff is also very friendly and gracious. However, despite the chef's talent, he seems to be having a lot going on outside of his work that interferes with his job performance, and thus I don't believe I will be buying a cake from this shop anymore. Like I had mentioned before, I had gotten a superb mango mousse cake for my roommate from here and wanted to buy another one for another friend's birthday. I placed the order almost a month in advance, and even called in a week before to check that they had it in their to do list. The day comes for me to pick up the cake, and guess what? The pastry chef had started making it, but left in the middle and never came back to finish! So I had a basic cake done, but no frosting on it, no decorations, no nothing... The staff were all so apologetic but they said that this isn't the first time that he's done something like this, and if fact, this occurs often! They tried to salvage the cake and spruce it up, but they had no experience with cake decorations or whatsoever, so it was pretty much useless. I was never more disappointed and upset, but the staff were so sorry that I couldn't get angry with them. I am still very upset with the pastry chef though. If you can't do your job properly, then maybe you shouldn't be doing it at all.", "business_id": "jGHYiK17BNNQxBxMtIBbFQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-08", "type": "review"}
