I get that local things can be awesome and that we should support them, but I would much rather book it to Chipotle than Carrburritos. The meat is about the only good thing about this place and, again, sub-par to places like Chipotle. Tacos come DROWNING in lettuce... Taco Bell called, they want their recipe back. The employees are usually pretty gruff but - and I say this as someone who genuinely appreciates Carrboro's existence - I'm unsurprised considering most places in Carrboro employ generally douchey folks. In the end I think this place is totally skippable. Try and find the taco truck that wanders around Main St Carrboro or go to Chipotle on Franklin... or even Armadillo Grill is better, honestly.", "business_id": "zQ7RsnP1dWVJsUNRWE3DhA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}
