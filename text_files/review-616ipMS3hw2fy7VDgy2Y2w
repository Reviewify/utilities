The guy at the front desk was super friendly (offered us snacks!) and had no problem switching us to a room away from the street (we really really needed some quiet that night after the previous two nights of not sleeping).  The room was pretty standard, but was clean and had everything we needed.  We made use of their movie selections and enjoyed listening to the frogs at night.  Much better than listening to bar shenanigans and traffic. The next morning we enjoyed breakfast on the porch and watched the variety of birds that came to eat at the feeders.  They have an awesome bench swing which we definitely had to try before heading out for home.  A peaceful and welcoming place to stay at a good price.", "type": "review", "business_id": "iuKkj96DhHbfoAfJRt7dBA"}
