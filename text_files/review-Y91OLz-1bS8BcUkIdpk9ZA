Okay, so I really do not ever get my money's worth at any buffet (I know... I'm such a foodie too!), but I feel like this place is worth it every time I come here for lunch :) The selection is not huge, but it's good enough. They have saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, fresh buttery naan... I can go on! Service is always excellent and it's not super crowded. To me... I love coming here because I don't alway want to get a single plate at an Indian restaurant. There's so much flavor and variety that I want to taste so I feel like a buffet is always best. I love it here... they have \"patio/outdoor\" seating for nice weather days. If you park in the garage, it's validated so no worries about finding parking!", "business_id": "mAKL2FYbfsQgR0g_MhqnsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-28", "type": "review"}
