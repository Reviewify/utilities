It's a food truck so the service is quick but the bonus is the friendliness.  Gosh, I feel like they're my BFF's everytime I place an order.  Guy who owns the truck cooks all the food and really seems to enjoy what he's doing.  Never too stressed to give a shout out, say thanks for the business or crack a joke when appropriate.  That's a rare skill when the orders are rolling in at such a fast pace.   A few (very) different styles of burgers along with a BYO option.  My fave is the Roquefort which features balsamic reduction and grilled onions (licking my lips) but I've also tried the Umami which has pickled daikon.  They're all delish.  Just try them all! I think it's cool that they have one person on the street taking orders while the owner cooks in the back.  It makes for more of an experience and less transactional when the person is standing there on the sidewalk chatting with you as you order, pay, and wait.  Big plus there! They're usually on Drexel U's campus so it's a hike if you're not already in the area but it's worth it.  There's street parking right in front of the truck so no hassle there.   Best part:  All the meat is ground in the truck.  The result?  The most juicy and succulent burger your mouth has ever experienced.  Even the buns deserve a shout out (woop woop to the Conshohocken Bread Company)!  And the fries are tasty too. Spot became a quick favorite in my office when it appeared here sometime earlier this year.  We all love it!   You will too.  I just know it.", "business_id": "5N9nJbymj9JtOAEx6ZMxpg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-22", "type": "review"}
