They have a pretty good sushi and I really like the fried California rolls.  It's also at a good price for what you get.  I like the soba noodles with shrimp tempura.  They also have a big screen TV, which is a little out of place...  \n  The waitstaff is nice as well.\n  But do yourself a favor, don't make an ass out of your ignorant self and try to speak Japanese to the servers 'cause the restaurant is Korean owned and have mostly Korean servers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bzP1utyRGu6ywPric5UmGg"}
