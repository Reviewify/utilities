They have a pretty good sushi and I really like the fried California rolls. It's also at a good price for what you get. I like the soba noodles with shrimp tempura. They also have a big screen TV, which is a little out of place... The waitstaff is nice as well. But do yourself a favor, don't make an ass out of your ignorant self and try to speak Japanese to the servers 'cause the restaurant is Korean owned and have mostly Korean servers.", "business_id": "bzP1utyRGu6ywPric5UmGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2006-11-27", "type": "review"}
