It was with such an intimate group of 8 of us and everyone had something to do.\n\nVolunteers today provide, cook, and serve a meal to families of children with life-threatening illnesses. Children travel great distances to access the quality care available in the Bay Area; Ronald McDonald House provides low-cost, temporary residences for their families.\n\nThe project leader bought food and we split the cost 12 bucks each. We prepared the following for the clients.\n- Hot Dogs\n- Chips\n- Cole Slaw\n- Pasta Salad\n- Strawberry chocolate brownie shortcake\n\nMy role was to wash and chop the strawberries and then help everyone clean up.\n\nIt was really great to see all the family and children enjoy the food that we made and we kept getting thank yous. Ronald McDonald is a really special place and I am glad that people are able to take advantage of their housing.\n\nWe were so efficient at our jobs that we finished at about 7pm instead of 8pm so we were able to get a tour of the facility. My favorite part was the 8,000 origami crane. If you visit this facility you must ask about the story behind it!\n\nI had a great time and would love to sign up again. Glad to hear that Ronald McDonald events have become every month instead of 4 times a year.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2PjVQHsavqHSHYX3cS7TUw"}
