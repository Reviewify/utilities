I love the layout of the place and the feeling like I'm in a diner on The Jetsons.  Every staff member I've ever encountered has been solicitous and appeared genuinely warm.  In the past, I enjoyed a breakfast at night, and the tempeh sandwich.  I loved that actually. But tonight, ugh.  I urge you, if you are tempted to try the open faced seitan sandwich, pick ANYTHING else.  It looks like the proverbial poop on a shingle.  And it doesn't taste sp good.  Several hours later, I don't feel so good.  I ate less than half.  When the server asked me how it was, all I could muster up was, \"It's different.\"   Literally.  They way they served it was not as described on the menu.  The mustard baked beans which are listed as a side were splashed across the piles of unappetizing brown, making it unappetizinger browner.   I still feel bloated and like I ate super unhealthily prepared food.  There's another place in Central Square that steams veggies in interesting combos and their menu urges you to notice how you feel after eating a meal there.  I always leave there feeling energized and refueled. The way I am right now, I feel like I won't be back to Veggie Galaxy.", "business_id": "qw5gR8vW7mSOK4VROSwdMA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-17", "type": "review"}
