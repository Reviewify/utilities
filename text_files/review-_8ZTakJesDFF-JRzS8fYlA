We were greeted by the exceptionally welcoming staff and the fun, bright colors of the decor.  My kid was intrigued immediately.  Our stylist lead us to her station, which is complete with a TV and some jars of lollipop and crackers.  I really liked that the chairs had straps with buckles b/c toddlers tend to squirm a lot.  The haircut was a small trim in the back and a trim in the bang, and the stylist was patient though not too efficient as I have seen with other kids stylists.  The TV program was Snip-Its' own program and did not engage my kid too much though, which is too bad.    At the end of the cut, the \"customer\" would use his/her little card, insert it into a slot and get a toy.  That was kinda fun.  Finally, my only grip was that perhaps it was the grand opening, or perhaps it was just early on in the day, I felt that there were too many staff standing out front and sort of overwhelmed the little customers a little.  But I have to say the service was friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Oe8RGy4SiSavz_g6zJCYxw"}
