Everything from the spicy curries to the mild Pad Thai are expertly prepared and very fresh.  Their Thai-style sweet and sour chicken is amazing:  Hand breaded and served with fresh fruits and veggies and a light sauce, it's miles ahead of the orange glop served at most Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe staff is wonderful; warm and friendly, and they can help newbies try something different.  They make you feel more like a friend than a customer.  The space is a converted house that's been there forever, and hopefully won't be going anywhere soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TuPliHI_pmNQa9ve2iXfFA"}
