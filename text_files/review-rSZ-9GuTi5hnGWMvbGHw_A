LONG STORY SHORT....This is a pretty nice hotel. Right across the street from the Fox Theater.   We stayed in the 2 bedroom 2 bath suite and the place was awesome!  2 full baths, excess closet space and a washer and dryer.  The staff were pretty nice but this place is not without it's share of problems.  There's some queens that work the desk that like to get catty and that's one strike!  In the downtown area, parking is extermely limitied and tight on top of that.  Valet is 25 dollars a day.   That's another strike...The front desk neglected to tell us when we booked the room that is was a $75 dollar/night deposit for incidentals.  Final blow... We could've saved our money and stayed somewhere cheaper and more centrally located.  I Won't come back here from all those reasons combined.", "business_id": "IWZg1OfbxbNZ10LhOTHfww", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-24", "type": "review"}
