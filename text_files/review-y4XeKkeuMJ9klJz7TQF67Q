Of course, everyone loves the Thai Cafe Nazi lady.  Or trying to figure out how much money this much-beloved-across-campus establishment brings in a year.  And there's something very satisfying about paying exactly $5 for your lunch.  Especially in the bottom your academic building.  But especially when it's del. icio. us.   The best part, though, is just eavesdropping on all the really peculiar discussions grad students from various departments have. The food does get old, as there are only so many options (i recommend the [barbecued] pork salad) and even fewer \"daily specials\" that rotate based on the day of the week.  If you ever have a quarter where on certain days of the week you have to eat out, you WILL get sick of Thai Cafe by the end of it.  But then you'll have another quarter where you don't go once, and by the next one you're craving it again. Update: My friend tells me they've raised their prices to $6 since I last went.  The raise to $5 was fine with me, but $5 is a magical value, and , well, Thai Cafe just lost their magic. Update: Confirmed. Now only 66 cents away from being the Thai Cafe of the Beast.", "business_id": "YmupeGDFKFLPfPUAe6aarQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-09", "type": "review"}
