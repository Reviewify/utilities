I first discovered this place when I was craving for  red velvet cake.  The first time I tried it, it was great, so I came back again but was a bit disappointed.  I also tried the tiramisu, the cake was dry and I don't taste the rum at all.  So far Buca de Beppo have the best tiramisu.   I still like Dolce, it's nice to have a quiet place to have coffee and something sweet.", "business_id": "Fh2vlptKk8jyedzCDPbXbw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-25", "type": "review"}
