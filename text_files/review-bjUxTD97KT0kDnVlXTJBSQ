Whether I'm walking home from a crazy night out, or I want a quick bite in the middle of a relaxing afternoon, I always feel comfortable popping into Kirby's.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Food is great! They're the only pub in town that offers a veggie burger. Which is great, because Vegetarians like greasy bar food, too.\n\nThere is always a friendly crowd and it's worth saying \"hello\" to other patrons mingling outside for a smoke. Neighborly, comfortable, and up for anything, Kirby's is a welcome stop on the way out, or the stumble home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "o3C7dw7StU96jvJGEh1GhQ"}
