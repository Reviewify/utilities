Give me a yellow cupcake with chocolate icing any day of the week. But if you find a place that sells nothing but cupcakes, you better expect a variety of cupcakes that will probably be sweet. Otherwise you will have a store filled with yellow cupcakes with chocolate icing and that would be boring. My Mom and I went on Saturday for my birthday despite the reviews listed on this site. I have to tell you that I disagree with many of you. The cake was moist and very flavorful. Yes they were sweet, but when you add candy and icing to cake, what do you expect? I have had Crumbs cupcakes on many occasions. I would have to say that these cupcakes are better. The cupcakes here are moister than those at Crumbs, the size is more appropriate and they are not even close to as sweet as the Crumbs cupcakes. I suggest having the Boston Cream Pie cupcake and the Peanut Butter Candy Cupcake. All in all, a cold glass of milk or cup of coffee with a cupcake from the House of Cupcakes is a win for me.", "business_id": "ud1IIvhgpbZQHTQlCJkWYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-27", "type": "review"}
