I also appreciated the huge variety.  My only complaint is that the only soy sauce available (little packets) was watery and didn't taste like anything more than salt water - very unpleasant!  So I ended up not eating a lot of my rice because it had been contaminated.  Get better soy sauce please! But 4 stars anyway because it's the only place that's fast enough to provide an enjoyable meal during my 12-12:30 break. The seating outside is nice too.", "business_id": "qEBzi4gG72w2khpVM2Flig", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-13", "type": "review"}
