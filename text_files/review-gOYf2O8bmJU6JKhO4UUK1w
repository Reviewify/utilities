I'm always afraid to imagine what goes behind the kitchen curtains....... or what's in the spicy chili sauce......\n\nBut... food tastes good to me! I don't know if it's the MSG or what, but it always seems like a pretty good deal to me when I order the eggplant dish or pineapple fried rice. I've tried a ton of their dishes, some much better than others of course, and lotus house just ends up being a place I come fairly often~\n\nTheir milk tea is also pretty good, nice that it's $1 with a meal.\nService just ok, but wouldn't expect anything much anyways.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XBPMMfMchDlxZG-qSsSdtw"}
