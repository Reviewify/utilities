To be honest, the place does not look sanitary, period. I'm always afraid to imagine what goes behind the kitchen curtains....... or what's in the spicy chili sauce...... But... food tastes good to me! I don't know if it's the MSG or what, but it always seems like a pretty good deal to me when I order the eggplant dish or pineapple fried rice. I've tried a ton of their dishes, some much better than others of course, and lotus house just ends up being a place I come fairly often~ Their milk tea is also pretty good, nice that it's $1 with a meal. Service just ok, but wouldn't expect anything much anyways.", "business_id": "XBPMMfMchDlxZG-qSsSdtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-29", "type": "review"}
