I pay $27 a month (staff rate) and I am actually motivated to workout when I come here.. I enjoy the rec pool (i am actually going to do some laps in a few minutes). I have tried the personal trainers and they are cool and fun! The sauna is great! And I never feel like a fat cow when I go workout because luckily every time I've gone there's been at least one person fatter than me! .... That's important when choosing a gym.", "business_id": "nFoT4tsQiMkWjNshYFOxPg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-12-23", "type": "review"}
