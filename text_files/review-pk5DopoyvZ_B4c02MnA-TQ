Let me explain. I'm giving Tamarind Bay 4/5 stars for 2 reasons: first, they use a poor choice of fonts on their sign, so I thought it was called Tamarind Boy  for the first couple of years I lived here. Implies a whole different sort of joint. Second, they're kind of expensive. I know this because every time my wife and I go here for dinner, she ends up ordering 2 entrees. I only order 1, and I leave full, but she seems to find room.  The food is right delicious, and pretty spicy compared to some of the other Indian restaurants in town. In particular I'm a sucker for the lamb saag. The service is good, and the bathroom is tiny but charming.", "business_id": "XjHwaC53U_xSyAL5-APIVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-14", "type": "review"}
