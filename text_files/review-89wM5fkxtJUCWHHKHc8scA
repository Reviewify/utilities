Yesterday I went to buy dinner on my break and my card got declined, no problem - I'll just run around the corner and get cash since I knew there was money in the account.  Went to the ATM and all I got was a slip saying my card has been deactivated.  Okay, now I'm starting to freak out a bit so I got to my computer and checked my account online, my money was still in both accounts, safe and sound and the exact amount that should have been. Next step was to make a call to customer service. Turns out the fraud department flagged the account because  someone tried to make a $110 purchase at a Walgreen's in Colorado at 6am??? They caught it immediately and my new card is in the mail. I'm so glad the red flag went up so fast and my funds are in tact, my only wish is that they had notified me before hand (a call or email), it would have saved me a little embarrassment. Luckily I was only at a cafe' and not a nice sit down establishment, else I would have been mortified. Lesson learned! Start carrying cash and don't use the debit card so much. As for the Sq. Hill branch itself, the employees have always been friendly and helpful and you can usually get in & out pretty quickly.", "business_id": "m7YtMqcTEtsMM5zK73hvvg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-20", "type": "review"}
