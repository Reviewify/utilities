When we arrive, there were no available tables, but the super-friendly staff made sure we were comfortable waiting - asking us if we wanted drinks while we waited, wanted to look over the menus, etc.\n\nWhen we were seated, the people-watching was excellent.  It is right in the heart of Harvard Square, with big windows that let in plenty of light.  I had a fantastic mimosa and the blueberry-banana-yogurt smoothie.  My friend had the granola, fresh fruit and greek yogurt, which was also exceptional.\n\nI will definitely be back for brunch in the future! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A"}
