The buzz burrito was good but their biscuits and gravy was amazing and better than the burrito my husband says :) I had the veggie omelette and it was delicious! The ingredients tasted fresh! The service was great and friendly too! We were seated and waited on within 15 minutes and our food came in about another 10 min! And we were a part of the Sunday brunch rush! Definitely worth stopping by! :) enjoy!", "business_id": "TrJWZNa37kbv20lbvOm-rg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-15", "type": "review"}
