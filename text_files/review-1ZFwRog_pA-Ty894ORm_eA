This might be the most expensive Taqueria I've eaten at so far. $8.75 for a super burrito carne asada, with NO complimentary chips. Want chips? Pay another $1.64 My husband was craving fish tacos. So we came here since it was the closest Mexican joint at the time. He liked them, except that the tortillas kept on falling apart. So he pretty much ate them by small pieces. My burrito was good. It tasted good, but not outstanding. The chips were pretty tasty tough. What I was impressed here was the salsa bar. I think it's one that has the most varieties I've ever seen so far. I certainly had fun tasting each one of them. Most of them are really good! I'm sure glad I paid extra just for my chips so that I could enjoy all those salsas. I left the place with my mouth pipping hot!", "business_id": "tJcGrLXB0zViCoEiYgcs1w", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-13", "type": "review"}
