There are a bunch of different cuisines represented.  It's better than most cafeteria foods, but not much.  Their pizza is surprisingly good.  It's easy to spend way too much money for what you're getting.  The nice open space also makes you feel you're someplace modern and pleasant even if the food is unremarkable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "boL-6bDJjzw7okoYwIVnBA"}
