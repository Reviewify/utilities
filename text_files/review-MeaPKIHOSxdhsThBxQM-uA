The food used to be much better, but it has really turned into slop, and over-priced slop at that.  The matzoh ball soup used to be safe, but they have even managed to ruin that.  The soup now contains last week's veggies, blended into mystery broth. In fact, the broth tasted like some cheap canned liquid with old veggies added.  Waste not want not is the motto at this place. And, we would be remiss without commenting on the wait staff, all of whom seem to dislike their jobs. This once somewhat edible standby is now not worth entering.", "business_id": "olrFYjKobULoH4-ZucnpTg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-29", "type": "review"}
