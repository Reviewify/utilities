I disagree; it's been a Boston \"institution,\" if you will, since the 1800s. You can frequently find books with fading Schoenhof's stickers at places like the Brattle Book Store. Either way, though, it's a great store and an excellent place to take out-of-town visitors who want to see why Boston is cool. We may not have restaurants that stay open past 2, but by God, we have some great bookstores.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mOxkXCmdt6ohg8Y3la5JBA"}
