Although the hotel is known for it's upscale, modern look... I felt that our overall experience just didn't live up to what's expected at a \"W\".  \n\nWe have a Starwoods AMEX, so we used points to book a \"free\" stay here in one of their suites.  The room itself is really nice, with a separate office area, separate living room area, and separate bedroom.  The TV in the bedroom is small, but there is a nice flatscreen in the living room.  The couches are kind of uncomfortable (they're like long, sleek, modern IKEA type couches), but it was L-shaped, so there was plenty of space for me and my husband.\n\nPros:\n-  BLISS bath products\n-  Good water pressure in the shower\n-  Friendly, not snobby receptionists (same with all the staff here)\n-  The bed is like sleeping on a cloud!\n-  Close to tons of good food within walking distance\n-  Not a bad selection of $4.99 movie specials\n-  The movie we ordered was glitchy in a few places so they comped it.  No, it wasn't a $4.99 movie, it was one of the $16 newly released movies.  Score!\n\nCons:\n-  Expensive valet parking ($35/night)\n-  Unimpressive lobby\n-  Loud at night because of all the partying that goes on in this hotel!\n-  THIN walls\n-  Pretty dismal room service options for dinner", "type": "review", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg"}
