I hired Carlos to host a Sweet 16 party.  I hired his company over another because of his glowing reviews of how he was very friendly and that his process of making drinks was a fun experience to watch which I thought would be fun for the kids.  After our initial conversation, I realized he would not actually be the person coming to the event so I asked him whether the staff he was sending was going to be friendly and make the experience fun for the kids.  He assured me that they were just as good as him.  \n\nUnfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case.  His staff was late and was not ready at the start time.  His staff was not friendly and they did not made the experience fun for the kids.  The kids even felt that their attitude was one in which they felt the bartender did not want to be there.  I told Carlos what happened and he was very apologetic, but it was too late.  \n\nIf you use Stanford Bartender maybe you need to make sure you get Carlos directly because otherwise you might not the type of experience all the reviews are raving about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9rdigHXd49AKYopcG9-Mnw"}
