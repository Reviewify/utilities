Fried Chicken Salad with honey mustard dressing. Plus I love their Thai Chicken pizza. I've gotten that at least 10 times. If you have a group, the hot spinach artichoke cheese dip is awesome. Plus they give you fresh bread and butter right when you sit down. The store next door is the icing on the cake! So fun to shop in there while you're waiting for your food or after you've eaten. Something for everyone! Toys, Jewelry, Candy, Greeting Cards, wine, gifts, So colorful! One of my faves!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XEvLTGnZ_ZLI3CiPlzM2NA"}
