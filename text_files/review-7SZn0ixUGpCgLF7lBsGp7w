If you're a big sports fan and don't have a formidable set up to watch big games then this is the place for you. \n\nVENUE: This is the reason why I gave it five stars There are so many televisions here -some of them smaller and in booths and others just plastered on the wall - and they're HUGE. No matter where you sit you have an excellent view of any game you want to watch. We came for one of the NBA semi games when it JUST opened and it wasn't too packed but around finals, it was PACKED.\n\nFOOD: Ordered the BBQ Wings and had burger. They were pretty standard. The wings were marinated nicely on the outside which is where most of the flavor stayed but the meat on the inside wasn't as good. Burger was a good safe \"go-to\" item. The food would have lost a star or two for me but as stated above, this place is heaven for game days.\n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was friendly and helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t0Jua5Oo9247QorSQ1WzPw"}
