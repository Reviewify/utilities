The pizza cheese steak was my choice  and was more than adequate, in fact very good. \n\nIt can be a little wild with respect to lines, and I was lucky to hit between peak times.  \n\nAll in all, great for a heavy lunch, but plan on a nap afterward.  Well worth the visit for samwich fans. \n\nThere is relatively little in the way of seating, except a few park benches just outside.
