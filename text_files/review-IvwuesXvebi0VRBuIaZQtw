(overnight street parking is illegal in providence) i was assured it did. however, upon moving in, i learned we did not have 2 spots, that they had promised. i was told the person i met with was unaware they had promised the spots to another tenant. then on moving day, they did not show up to unlock the apartment or provide keys. so, i'm sitting around with a moving crew that was costing me more and more by the minute as they tried to track down the landlord. liars and cheats, stay away.. oh, i also wanted to add that when i complained about the parking spot situation, i was told by the agent the we rented from, the he \"works for the property owner and could care less what we think.\"", "business_id": "XOJlI8h1KeAgm4p7sX57hQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-12", "type": "review"}
