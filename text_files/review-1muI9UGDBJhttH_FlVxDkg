But its poor maintenance and customer service means that you risk getting mispacked items. I bought a bed here, drove it all the way home just to find out that it was obviously a previously returned item which was missing pieces as well as the assembly instruction. I called to see if I can have it exchanged in a different branch that's closer to my house, but it was impossible to get out of their infinite loop of recorded messages. So I drove it all the way back to this store, explained what had happened and all I got was a refund and an obnoxious 'have a good day'. An apology would have made my experience bearable! Incidentally, their 'swedish meatballs' are overrated. they are just plain meatballs.", "business_id": "XRo6PB-FMYDMeAMKTnQdNg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-22", "type": "review"}
