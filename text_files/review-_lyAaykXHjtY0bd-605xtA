The menu here says the minimum is $20 but when I called the woman told me it was $25. Fine. The delivery takes over an hour despite multiple attempts to confirm my address. Finally, the delivery girl comes and I go outside to look for her because she can't find my house and the person on the phone wrote down the incorrect house number DESPITE my multiple address confirmations. They also forgot my orders of rice. You need rice with Chinese food. Since I paid with a credit card, I was unable to NOT pay for the rice. However, instead of even pretending to be sorry, the delivery girl just stated rudely \"there isn't rice with this order\" and proceeded to give me a dollar for it.  First, two orders of rice is over a dollar, and second, it's not about the rice.  It's about the slow service, the failure to provide what was ordered, and then acting like it was MY fault that they were late and forgot part of my order.  When I called to talk to someone, the man, \"John\" hung up on me twice. The food was mediocre and every single person I dealt with along the way was incredibly rude.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_mv3DhRD3L3okFXYjxX_Cg"}
