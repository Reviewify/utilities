Order their one-of-a-kind Iced or Hot Caramello and you'll be thanking me later. Their Mulled Spiced Cider is a great alternative. I always look forward to ordering up a Caramello right before hitting the road to fuel my long drive back home, or just as a morning treat when I'm in town for the wknd. Their patio is nice to hang out at too!", "business_id": "Zq8I8faj8_VTDFulo8yo6w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-08", "type": "review"}
