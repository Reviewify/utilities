The decor is not early 1970 Formica. What is this place? This can't be a Washington State Liquor store... Can it? Then it hits me. Its the closest store to the University of Washington. That's when reality set in. The place was filled with frat boys and sorority girls getting their drunk on. The carpet was stained in a couple of places by an unknown fluid, but at least there was a carpet. When I got to the counter to pay I had a long wait as the two sorority girls and one frat boy in front of me had to ask a bunch of mindless questions about Yeager bombs while they chatted on their cell phones. When it came time for me to pay the booze dealer asked to see my ID. Get this... They ask to see every ones ID... God forbid that some frat boy got ahold of some cheap liquor... On the other hand, maybe that is a good thing. My parting shot: Its a bitch to get to this place. Its always busy at the intersection and sometimes it can be a ten minute wait just to get through the light.", "business_id": "04UJdYrRfigulJY6b3pn6A", "stars": 3, "date": "2006-12-07", "type": "review"}
