My BF brought home the take-out, and everything changed. I can't stop thinking about house chowmain with hand-rolled noodles -- they're like silky ribbons of delicious. The beef hunan is spicey with lots of vegetables, and the dumplings and spring rolls are also excellent. \n\nThis isn't as cheap as the $4 lunch specials you'll find south on the Ave. I have no means of knowing whether it's authentic or whatever, nor do I really care. It could be packed with MSG (though more research tells us MSG is just fine). Also, since I've only ordered take-out, I can't judge atmosphere or even cleanliness. But the woman who takes our order is super friendly, the food is ready quickly, it's no more pricey than almost any decent meal in Seattle, and I'm in love with those noodles.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bLRet5wIxuGym7AXtIHdHg"}
