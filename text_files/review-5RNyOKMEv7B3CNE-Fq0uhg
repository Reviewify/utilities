But on David's birthday, David gets to choose, so Raven Grill it was. Seating, ordering, wine, salad, entree delivery, everything was smooth as silk (except when I almost backed into that car in the too-narrow parking lot) if a bit perfunctory. I was so pleased we'd found a good place. Our entrees were great. I had the pecan-crusted chicken, two large breasts, pounded thin, with a nice coating. I would have liked to taste pecans even more, but great. With sweet potato wedges and perfectly steamed green beans. David's steak, mashed potatoes and squash were equally well received. And then it all fell apart. After the post entree delivery to check on things, we never got another visit from our waiter till what seemed like midnight. Food long since eaten, wine and water glasses long since emptied, we waited. And waited. Did we say something wrong? Our waiter was around. He visited an adjacent table twice. He talked to a table across the room for what seemed like five minutes. I suppose we should have waved our arms, but we were a bit faint with hunger at that point, and were trying to conserve our strength. Finally, he arrived, offered dessert (breakfast maybe?), we declined, got the bill, waited some more, paid our $67 (can't explain the poor service by saying we were a couple of cheapskates) and left. It's hard for me to imagine how service at a fine restaurant could be so bad. After a nearly flawless start, Raven Grill managed to really annoy us. I wish I could recommend them. Maybe if you wait a while.", "business_id": "JyOh6zIV1sGINuEnzOBckw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-05-21", "type": "review"}
