But because we were in Berkeley and because all of my friends have suggested that I try this place out, my boyfriend and I stopped by Bear's Ramen House last Friday night. My boyfriend and I ordered a Spam Kimchi Fried Rice to share ($7.50 after tax). Right after ordering, we saw the man begin to make it. The place is quite small, with a couple of counters and about 10 seats total. The guy working seemed to be friendly and my boyfriend described him as \"chill.\" Within minutes, our order was ready. The rice was very flavorful and the portion size was plenty for the two of us. Spam always goes perfectly in kimchi fried rice; but they also have chicken, beef, tofu, as options. The fried egg on top was picture perfect, until we smashed the yolk with our chopsticks. The yolk adds a nice creaminess and savoriness to the whole dish. In fact, the egg was so good, half way through eating our fried rice, we asked the man for another egg ($0.50). Delicious. This place lived up to the hype. I hope to come back! My boyfriend's parents ordered tofu ramen which they really enjoyed, also.
