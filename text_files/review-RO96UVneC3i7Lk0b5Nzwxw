I know I did. I wasn't a fan of (of all things) their business sign, so I wrote them off. But they happen to have a good selection of street gear if that's your style. I had asked someone where they got their A Life shirt, and they said Motivation. The real reason you should check this place out, however, is because they get THE best hip hop acts to come here and sign autographs after their shows. No joke. Talib Kweli, Lupe Fiasco, the list goes on. You wonder how the hell this tiny boutique gets the coolest cats to chill there, and it's because the owner is friends with them. It's awesome because the boutique is extremely accessible for students, it is right on S. University near East Quad and on the Link line.", "business_id": "lZWfbfxP2nvcV3MzC7EtzQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-24", "type": "review"}
