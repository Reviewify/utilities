It's a college bar, and it serves its purpose well. It's kind of in a league of its own, and it caters to the general public.  They have a few real specials and leagues and decent lane availability, as opposed to the laser party all the time atmosphere of other lanes.  Their section designated for billiards is good. The beer is kept in a loft with the pins to keep everything at proper humidity and temperature. It would be cool if the reviewers put pictures of the actual alley instead of some random google image of a lefty bowler in some other state.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fGawcocJqcj3wXjHj7YXAg"}
