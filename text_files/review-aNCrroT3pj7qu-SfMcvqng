You can enjoy the very romantic lights and cozy environment here when you go visit. This place showcases Austin's personality and characteristics. \nI had been here many times with my friends and I even took my family here when they came to visit me in Austin.\nThey have awesome takoyaki !!! I had it before in Taiwan but had never seen anything like this before. I was kinda skeptical at first but I loved it immediately and ever since. I told all of my friends to go and the reviews are great. \nYou can get takoyaki and their rice ball for $7 which is a great buy. Even though the takoyaki could be smaller in portion, the rice ball will definitely fill you up. I also love their rice ball with garlic soy sauce!! It makes my mouth watering just thinking about it. It's a great place to try something new and I recommend all of you to go.\nThe only downside is that the food may take a while to come out if they are busy. Otherwise, everything is great here. The owners are very nice and friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8SqxzaPVVBTIxrbJKZwDxg"}
