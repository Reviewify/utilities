The service is fun and cheeky, and the food is quite good.  \n\nTheir definition of \"cajun\" is a bit liberal at times, but it's all quite tasty.  My favorite dishes are the crab cakes and the andouille sausage etouffee.\n\nThe bar selection is excellent, and it's worth splurging on a fishbowl with a few of your friends.  \n\nThe best value is their lunch menu, where you can get a heaping ton of food for a very very reasonable price.  Go again and again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IzQSPwMVuFZEGofzhLWSkA"}
