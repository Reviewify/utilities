I was greeted with a lovely smile and I proceed to order a basic meat pizza. Within a couple of minutes, I was presented with a large warm, meaty, cheesey, and fresh looking pie.\n\nNeedless to say, I devoured it within minutes. That's how good it is.\n\nI will be back with friends next week, for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WB8mPwmJ3ZfLlZOAxAB_ww"}
