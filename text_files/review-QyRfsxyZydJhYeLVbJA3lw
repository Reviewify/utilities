As I walked in, I couldn't help but notice the nice decor of the restaurant. I was greeted with a lovely smile and I proceed to order a basic meat pizza. Within a couple of minutes, I was presented with a large warm, meaty, cheesey, and fresh looking pie. Needless to say, I devoured it within minutes. That's how good it is. I will be back with friends next week, for sure.", "business_id": "WB8mPwmJ3ZfLlZOAxAB_ww", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}
