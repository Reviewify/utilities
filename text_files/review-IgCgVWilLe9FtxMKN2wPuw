Or really, anywhere for that matter. I visited this morning at about 11:00 on a saturday and got 4 different kinds of bagels. 3 of the 4 were uncooked. Maybe a new baker was working today, but when you look at the bagels it was obvious they weren't cooked. So small and dense. They shouldn't even have sold them to me. Unfortunately I didn't look at them until i got home. The first time I went here they were out of almost everything. The second (and last) time I went was today. This bagel place is terrible. I would not go there. Make the trip to Einstein Bros in W. Lafayette. They have way more customers and hence way fresher (and cooked) bagels, not to mention more types to choose from.", "business_id": "v179TdgIVXpWiyz-J1flyg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-02-27", "type": "review"}
