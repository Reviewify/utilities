(i heard very bad things about it) the \"fancy\" rolls aren't all that cheap, but open up the menu and you get a ton of nontraditional rolls for less than $5. my bf and i got the chicken teriyaki roll, kappa maki, a korean-style roll, salmon maki, and one with deep fried shrimp and vegetables. my favorite was the last one...forgot its name. the sushi is sliced very thin, which i like cause i can actually fit the whole thing in my mouth. a downside is that the sushi took quite a while for them to prepare...and there was no complimentary miso soup, salad, or soy beans to munch on... note: the adzuki (red bean) ice cream is a must have for dessert.", "business_id": "2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-15", "type": "review"}
