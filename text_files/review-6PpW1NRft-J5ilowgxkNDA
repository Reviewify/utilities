I really missed having a chocolate cafe around when I left Champaign.. I loved the dark chocolate circles resting on the pillow of whipped cream floating on a dark chocolate heaven of delicious creamy liquidy chocolatey goodness. I also loved the times when I was able to indulge in an expensive bite of a chocolate truffle (especially loved that dark chocolate truffle shaped like a cute little dog). I had discovered there was one in San Francisco, and only got to go there once.. and now, none of the Moonstrucks exist!!!! I guess you can only truly appreciate things when they're gone.. Moonstruck, I loved you so, and I will always hold you dear in my heart.", "business_id": "6U8Yniq8cMQcedhs040ZoA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-22", "type": "review"}
