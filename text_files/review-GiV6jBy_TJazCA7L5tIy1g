So in spite of that we didn't like it last time then I said let's give it another try. The potato salad was fatty and blend in its taste.  The baked goods we stay off because the cashiers/helpers don't even know what is in it. They sell us cakes saying they are nut free and our friends child gets an allergic reaction because it turned out they were almond based - and then I look and feel horrible. When I mentioned it the following time they just didn't care \"but said oh well maybe there is nuts in those cakes\". No apology No concern! The food looks delicious but it is so overpriced and most of the times I am disappointed. And for those prices then I might as well go out and be served.", "business_id": "DiPNysYpR12bQVevbodNZQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-23", "type": "review"}
