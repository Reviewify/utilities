Hard to vetch when you are getting money off and the cocktails are this nice. Food too for that matter.\n\nThe cocktail I chose was a margarita, I know, yawn. Not so fast. This was an awesome and fresh version that made me extremely happy. Just right, not fakey or sweet and not too puckery. Smooth and chilly and making me one happy camper. My dining companion's back porch lemonade was delightful too. Citrus vodka, lemon juice, ginger syrup, cranberry juice and ginger beer melded into happiness. I was tempted to switch on round two but it's just so damn hard to find a decent margarita to be frank.\n\nFor food, bar food was the option for us. Scotch duck eggs are just fabu, we each gorged on them because they just made us that content. Try one yourself and you are sure to be hooked. The spicy fried chickpeas were very nice. Can I ever hate duck fat fries? No but these are a lovely rendition, especially with the roasted garlic mayo or the cheese curds, duck confit and duck gravy. This place clearly is not artery friendly but neither am I. The burger with the goat monterey jack was just making every one of my tastebuds sing (ask to add an egg) and my pal loved the fried egg and bacon concoction she inhaled. We wanted to try more but you can only eat so much.\n\nI can't five star it, although I am tempted, as even with the deals it runs spendy and the experience was not stellar (slow, unfriendly). I also have not tried any of the mains or any such. I will come back though and hopefully the rating will go up. Hmmmm brunch....", "type": "review", "business_id": "hlA7e9LQ4hPyohmQh4G8RA"}
