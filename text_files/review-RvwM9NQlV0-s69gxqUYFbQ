Cute interior, nice wine list, good service (surprised by some of the complaints on Yelp.)\n\nConnected to the local Slow Food Movement - some nice choices on the menu -try the Crabmeat and Avocado Salad - or the Rigatoni with Filet Mignon Tips and Gorgonzola Cheese - or the Osso Buco. Great specials too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zcNCTs5zaMeq1HyzvHQJGA"}
