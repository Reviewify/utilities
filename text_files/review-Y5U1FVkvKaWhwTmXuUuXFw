I have too much yarn already, but does that keep me from buying more?  NO because like any addict, I can't control the behavior.  Symptoms worsen whenever I am within a 3-mile radius of Weaving Works, where I am drawn in to the woolly warm center of the store.  I visit three or four times a month, inevitably leaving with a bag of something, ANYTHING--the stock of basic wools and cottons (Brown Sheep, Cascade) is strong, balanced by a regularly changing selection of more expensive/specialty yarns (Adrienne Vittadini, Debbie Bliss, Manos, Colinette, Jamieson).  The sock yarn is everywhere.  The option of purchasing yarn from a cone is relatively unique in the local market.  The roving section takes up at least 25% of the store, and even if you're not a spinner (me!), it's fun to roam the rows of roving and feel the yummies--merino batts, locks of soy silk, milk fiber!  \n\nNeedle and notion selection is broad and even includes the Brittany 4\" DPNs, a rare find these days.  The book section is huge but I find it to be somewhat difficult to find specific works, as they seem to be organized by type of project--baby knits, scarves/accessories, sweaters, lace, etc.  It's fun for browsing, but when you're looking for a book that has ALL of those types of projects, it's sometimes impossible to find.  \n\nOne thing to note:  if you're attending a book signing/author appearance, be sure to get there early and wear layers--the upstairs room where the last reading I attended was held got very crowded and VERY warm.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RJV_wjNo0o8VCka_fYIDAA"}
