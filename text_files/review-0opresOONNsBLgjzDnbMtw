Can I remind the Yelp community of the former occupant of Tory Row's new home? A moment of silence, please, for the Greenhouse Cafe -- home of really great pie, really terrible sevice, and no bathrooms. Tory Row does not have particularly large shoes to fill. We were seated right away at a little table right up next to the front windows, perfect for people-watching. Harvard Square is still the people-watching Mecca of C-bridge, so its nice to have a new dining establishment that takes advanges of its awesome views of humanity. My only beef was that the layout of the seating is a little awkward. The tables seemed super close together. I was kind of afraid that the oppressive mother / father team at the table next to us was going to start asking me about *my* summer internship plans. Also, we ordered several plates and a bottle of wine to split three ways, and the tiny cafe-table top was barely able to accomodate our spread. I guess the solution to that problem is -- stop being a fatass. Anyway -- the food itself was delish! The tomato, basil mozzarella flatbread was devine, and perfect for sharing. When we'd used up the fresh loaf of bread that came with our hummus plate, the waitress gladly offered to bring us more so we could polish off the rest of the hummus. The wide variety of brews and vinos also made for a good time. And best of all, when we'd paid our check, the waitress told us not to rush and feel free to hang out for awhile -- props for that! There's nothing I hate more than being kicked to the curb immediately upon signing my reciept. All and all -- a lovely night out. Tory Row -- I shall return!", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-08", "type": "review"}
