(doesn't matter, as it never fits or feels right anyway.) i think my odyssey to reclaim the j. crew that once was is finally coming to an end. overall, even if i could someday find something here that doesn't fit weird, i want clothing that feels good on. especially if i'm paying j. crew prices.", "business_id": "W-QA1Q8Atz1cizkfdfc24A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-29", "type": "review"}
