They even serve fresh cucumber/orange water while you're waiting. \n\nThe Zoom! whitening session wasn't the most comfortable half hour I've ever spent but the results were amazing. I jokingly said I wanted white as snow teeth thinking that it wasn't possible, but, lo and behold, my teeth turned bright white. I couldn't stop smiling all the way home. I'll definitely go back when it's time for a touch up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YvfwtJKIbfKnomSn6oBJMg"}
