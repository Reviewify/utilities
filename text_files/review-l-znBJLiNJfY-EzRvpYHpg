Went around 6:30-7 to beat the crowds and it worked! Line was out the door when we left. Loved that we could bring our own wine! Food came out soo fast, which was great cuz we were starving. Had the Avocado Salad, Shumai Soup, Sakura Roll (our favorite), yam roll, firedragon roll, shitake hand roll. Everything was AH-mazing. Food was soo good! Def be back real soon!", "business_id": "Dw88AIwVNK7hVUB6wQ45FA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-11", "type": "review"}
