At that point it didn't seem odd to hear that as this bill minimally resembles the bills of the '00's.\nShe took the bill and immediately stepped away from the window and a out of my sight-this was odd. I took 2 steps to my left and I could see her scrutinizing the bill. She then used the marker that is designed to authenticate currency, and it did. \nShe then told me, \"Hold on. I have to check this out\". I let her know that is not a problem but that I would either need to carry the bill where she was going or to at least wait there with the bill while she gets whatever she needs to confirm her choice.\nNow I started feeling a little weird as she held the bill against light and you can clearly see the strip and she marked it.\nShe walked out the door to a small hallway near us and I asked her for the bill when she said, \"I am just going to bring this upstairs to check it. I am the manager\". I told her that I will be assisting her and she told me that I could not. Now things are starting to get extremely weird.\nShe wants to walk away with someones $100 bill??? I \"can't go with her\"?? What possible reason would she have for not allowing me to escort her? This is very weird and with my 15+ years in restaurant and retail management I have never seen, or heard, of any kind of situation even remotely close to this.\nI explained to her that the bill would not leave my site and I could go elsewhere to make change for it if that would suffice but in no way, shape, or form would that bill leave my sight and then I asked for it back-AGAIN! She handed it to me and I asked what she thought made it seem strange other than the obvious fact that she claimed she had never seen one like this before and she pointed to a stain that was on the bill. I laughed and said, \"Well you chose not to accept it so now I have to go elsewhere but that's cool\".\n\nSee what was really odd was her statement that she had never seen anything like it before. I know she was very close to my age and I find it extremely unlikely that she has not seen one like that as that's how they were made. LOL I had proof in my hand LOL.\n\nIn any case she was an absolute moron and started the whole situation off with a lie. I have had my hands on dozens of these as I was in my late teens and early 20's through the 80's. I also got one of these 2 years ago.\n\nWhat was worse than anything is that she had the courage to tell me she was going somewhere I couldn't with my money. If she had walked away with it I was going to dial 911 and not do another thing until the police got there. This idiot almost got arrested for theft.\n\nIn my 15+ years of restaurant and retail management I have never, under any circumstances, been told I have the liberty of taking a customer's money ANYWHERE where they are not welcomed!! Nothing written or verbal has ever suggested this and her actions were overly shady!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bDlB0Y7D-9mpx2kvdFZRsg"}
