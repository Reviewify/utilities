A little more upscale in ambiance than BJ's or Sammy's.\n\nWhen I'm not in the mood for the BBQ chicken pizza (always a favorite no matter where I go), I can make a meal out of the creamy, flavorful tortilla soup and hummus with flatbread, which I really order just for the flatbread. It is damn good.\n\nThe BBQ chicken chopped salad is another favorite (there's a trend here), along with the original chopped.\n\nThe service is usually pretty good, even with large parties. The last few times my bf and I have gone, we've had the same bubbly blonde waitress, who was good about giving us time to eat and talk. I hate \"hovering\" servers.\n\nOverall, good food at a reasonable price. I like this for dates with the significant other, but I often take my parents here when they visit too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mg1CS5aRT_eV4qaGpEvnIQ"}
