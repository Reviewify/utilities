Favorites don't come easily for me, but in this case, I had to call it! The musakaa wrap is fan-worthy alone. The menu description says it melts in your mouth and that is so wonderfully true. The falafel wrap is good too, but it's not worth passing up the musakaa for. I haven't been able to bring myself to try any of the other veggie wraps because I'm always craving the musakaa. I also have not yet sampled their hummus or baba. The lentil spinach lemon soup is another star of the Taza 21 menu. With a nice balance of earthy and tangy flavors, it's much more flavorful than the average lentil soup. And I find the cauliflower irresistible, as it sits in the case, looking perfectly browned, right by the cash register - impulse buy! But not at all the sort one regrets! The stuffed grape leaves are average and skippable, unless you're really in the mood for grape leaves. I enjoy the service dynamic of the husband and wife duo and even though the space is geared toward take-out, it's not a bad place to take a seat in. Of all that I've tried, the only thing I cannot recommend is a fruit smoothie - tasted weirdly artificial to me. Also, don't get chips, get sauce. The cucumber sauce is yogurt based, but you can ask for tahini sauce instead for a vegan option. Bottom line is, the food is fresh and prepared with care and I'd go out of my way to eat here.", "business_id": "wUrnir4yQj4Lnta-jdqqxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-13", "type": "review"}
