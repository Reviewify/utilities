It was nothing really to write about.  I'm typing this a month later and can't even remember what I ate, except that it was just ok.  Prices are a little on the higher side, but at least the service is still good.  Updated to 3 stars. Came here on a saturday night to check out the dessert.  My gf and I shared the \"Chocolate soup\".  All I have to say is \"wow\"...I mean...in manly terms...holy sh*t its good.  Probably one of the best souffles I've ever had.  If you are a chocolate lover, you'll prolly swoon over it.  My girlfriend had a nice riesling while I had a Flying Dog Old Scratch Amber (yeah im a beerman).  Tasty beer, little bit of fruity hops and LOTS of malt with excellent character.   Staff was very nice and courteous.  Our waiter was cool, claimed this was a wine place but he was a beerman like me haha.  Manager greeted us in and out the door with a smile. One star will be pending as I have not tried the food yet.  However, judging by the dessert, I'm seriously licking my chops.  I can't wait to come and eat a real dinner.  I believe I may have found another gem tucked away on the backstreets of pasadena.", "business_id": "MJMTsZ0ty0RCyUjF_6XVPg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-03-09", "type": "review"}
