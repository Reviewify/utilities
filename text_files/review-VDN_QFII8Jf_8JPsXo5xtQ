Especially on a basketball game night. There were probably 30 people in line and it took about 20 minutes to get through the line. But I have been to other Chipotles during mad lunch rushes with same kind of line and have it go much faster. This one is also really small, hard to get your drinks and sit down. In a pinch, it was ok, but I wouldn't seek this one out again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TPPk2Ii3rMcBN7qylcq9gw"}
