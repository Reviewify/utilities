And boy howdy, I'm glad she did. There are a ton of delightful flavors.  The price is nice.  The boba is (almost) always perfectly chewy and sweet. (I cannot tell a lie - once in a great while, the boba is overcooked and gummy). The place is cash only so make sure to bring enough for a tea and some tasty mochi ice cream (if the mood suits you!)", "business_id": "ch1ercqwoNLpQLxpTb90KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-20", "type": "review"}
