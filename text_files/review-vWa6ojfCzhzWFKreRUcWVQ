I thought my favorite thai noodle dish was phad thai, but after discovering some of the other dishes on the menu and their unique flavors i now crave i have a really difficult time choosing. I've been to a bunch of thai restaurants in the city, and this is by far my favorite. Plus the staff is always so fun and friendly, its really easy for this place to become your new hangout. And i hear a bar is coming soon!", "business_id": "gPPIvynVCnKsvADSgszAqg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-18", "type": "review"}
