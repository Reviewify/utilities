Even though it's the exact same thing everywhere, it's still better than the other sandwich chains.  They keep it simple and that's best for this kind of thing.  For get subway with all their fads and new fangled health gimmicks they try and lure you in with.   I've tried most of their sandwiches over the years and they're all great.  Just depends on what you feel like.  \n\nand Customer Appreciation Day with $1 subs.  The place was killin it.\n\nYou gotta love that, a complete lunch for three dollars when this happens.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8q_fyg8fkMeVx69jDhJ7jw"}
