Although, I felt their menu was great and featured a lot of great dishes that are hard to come by in the DC area, the taste and quality was disappointing. I thought the selection was good as well as the service. But the actual flavor and quality was lacking. We ordered an appetizer sampler which I thought was just OK. It wasn't very fresh, and tasted cold. The breads were delicious, but the entree's were not exceptional. I had the Baingan Bharta which is one of my favorites, and here it was not that great. Additionally, our table also shared the Palak Paneer and another Paneer dish that I cannot remember the name for, but featured peas and a more thicker base. Although, I thought that was better the Palak Paneer was so bland and dull here.  I understand this place is great for those who are vegetarians because of the options they have. And if I was that would probably be enough to make me want to return, but because I am not and have enjoyed Indian food at much better places, I wouldn't return here. It just didn't float my boat like some other places have. Again, great service and variety.", "business_id": "WmEsbfEJn5WZ0D8dViYT8w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-10", "type": "review"}
