Very cute.\n\nJust had the Pollone Chicken Sandwich  for lunch and it was just what i needed. Fresh and warm chicken in a perfectly toasted bun with coleslaw that is not the mayonnaise-y type. The chicken breast is super juicy and not what you make think of when you think fried chicken breast. It's freshly done so it's not tough meat at all. \n\nI definitely want to get back and try the burger...The pictures for it look amazing", "type": "review", "business_id": "3XwVZr6Jj2DnZ8B2W3RboQ"}
