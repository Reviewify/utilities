I can tell you right now that you are very wrong. Rocks is definitely a cut above the other bars and pubs for a couple reasons. They first major thing you notice is that they, unlike most other places in the area, have ample parking and you don't have to drive around forever looking for street parking. Second, the bar has a much better atmosphere for watching the big game. Everyone tends to run to Kams or the like to watch the game, but people who know better go to Rocks. Lastly, they serve the best horseshoes anywhere near campus. My friends and I would go to Rocks just to get horseshoes. You really have to go just to try one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "831BmmuoZF8px1KhBmRB9w"}
