To get in, you walk down a set of stairs, show the bouncer your ID, and enter into an entirely new world.  On one side, there is a bar, and on the other is a bunch of tables.  As it was a busy night, we had to wait awhile to be seated.  And then comes the good part.\n\nMy order for the evening was on recommendation.  One of my co-workers recommended that in Boston, I get a lobster roll, and this is exactly what I did.  With the dish, I paired it up with Wachusetts Blueberry Beer.  In short, the absolute best decision I ever made.  The lobster roll was just phenomenal, and the beer had the fruitiest taste, and instantly made me a fruit beer fan.\n\nFor me, the experience was absolutely savory and beautiful.  I'm definitely coming here the next time I am in Boston.\n\nAs for Wachusetts, I emailed them and asked if they could distribute their beer to California.  Still waiting!", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
