The facility isn't particularly large, but it has everything you need for a fine workout. They don't necessarily have the newest machines, but they keep everything in a good state of repair. The locker room and bathrooms are kept extremely clean as well. A nice balance between quality and value.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eHyxHUig9dKHUQD98vweig"}
