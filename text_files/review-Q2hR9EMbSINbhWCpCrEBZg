Now THAT is a sweet deal!  ... So sweet that I went for the first time today... and second and third... There's quite a few flavors of ice cream to choose from, and maybe 7 or so types of cookies, too.  The cookies are very soft, warm, and delicious, and the ice cream is great.   One of my favorite cookies is the Turtle cookie, which is a chocolate cookies with caramel and macadamia nuts, if I remember correctly. Anyway, enough said, GO EAT! Note:  Hours are shorter during winter while the students are away, and since I came right before closing time on a dead Berkeley winter day, the cookies were not as fresh and not all the varieties were there. This doesn't change that this place is 5 stars, darn it!  Just plan to come at a busier time and you'll be happier, and maybe phone ahead if school's not in session to make sure you're scheduling your Cream run optimally.", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-11", "type": "review"}
