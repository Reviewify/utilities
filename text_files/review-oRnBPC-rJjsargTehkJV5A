I love spinning and I love this studio!  It is clean and well maintained.  The instructors are well trained and very helpful.  New clients are always assisted on the bikes and monitored through the class.  Every instructor is different and you will come to like different ones for different reasons.  It can be pricey but if you get on the email list, you will receive notice of specials that are very well priced.  It is a great workout and a welcome addition to the Claremont Village.", "type": "review", "business_id": "94z1jW7rizqPBpAiDv6ToA"}
