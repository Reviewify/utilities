I was just here because I was having midnight cravings. It did not satisfy my cravings at all. I am not mpressed with my pizza. You start off choosing 1 of 3 different types of pizzas I chose the pizza margherrita which comes with tomato sauce and mozarella cheese for $6 and each topping you add is $1. I ordered the margherita pizza with roasted garlic and it was nothing special. The roasted garlic was okay but for some reason the dough tasted kind weird when it was toasted. It has some infused scent that I am not used to. One side of my crust was also super burnt. I didn't eat it because I do not want to get cancer. This place is like a chipotle/subway of customized pizzas. But you end up with a pizza that doesn't taste like how you expected it to be. They will start selling alcohol on Wednesday so hopefully the pizza will taste better with some beer or wine.", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-26", "type": "review"}
