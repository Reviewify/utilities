The building is a little small and shabby, but you get huge top-notch laughs.  The prices are also reasonable.  You sit in a small stadium-seating room looking down on a small stage.  The host introduces general scenarios and ask for the audience to give ideas on how they should pan out.  The improv comics then act out the scenes.  The scenes are hilarious because some audience members come up with crazy ideas.  I believe some of the ideas are generated as a result of the bucket of beers you can buy at the bar.  You will enjoy it beginning with the introduction from the host until you leave.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4DIt9z-E4OReC_fooq1odQ"}
