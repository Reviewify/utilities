In terms of great food for the money, it can't be beat! I'm targeting this review for folks who are \"spice wimps\" like me. While I can handle \"spice\" in your regular wimpy Americanized restaurant, I don't dare order anything spicy at Mary's. So here's what I do! Want to try those awesome wontons in the Suan La Chow Show? They use the exact same dumplings in the Wonton soup... which at Mary's is merely a delivery medium for the wontons. You get just as many wontons in the soup as in suan... possibly even more. They often make a shrimp version of the wontons for use in both dishes; they're quite nice but I love the traditional pork version so much that I rarely order them. The Dun Dun noodles are really good, but REALLY spicy hot. However, the Tsar Cheng noodles are also really good (it's a ground pork sauce made with hoisin and other yummy stuff) and they're not spicy hot at all. The Peking Ravioils (knows as potstickers or pan-fried dumplings in other towns) are always great, but be careful with the dipping sauce. Depending on who is doing the cooking, it can vary from nicely sharp to call the fire department hot! My other recommendations for the non-spicy crowd are Mandarin Beef (or other proteins), pork with peking sauce, and chicken and cashews. Some folks love the orange sauce chicken, but I think the fried chicken cutlet under that nice sauce is usually over-breaded and dried out.", "business_id": "sPd-zQtPSARMw1vx131v1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-02", "type": "review"}
