Lots of families, kids' sports teams, tourists, and such.  The food is exactly what I remember - mediocre burgers and dogs, greasy fries, kickass fountain drinks, and delicious Frosted Oranges (think orange creamsicle in drinkable form).  We ate inside as we always do, but I do think I'll have to try the famous drive up one day.  You get awesome hats, get to hear them yell WHAT'LL YA HAVE!, and get to enjoy one of Atlanta's greatest and greasiest institutions.  Nothing ever changes here, so I am pretty sure when I come back in a few years it will be exactly the same.  Love that about the place.", "business_id": "sPhPI3B6tvcJIULhICr-Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}
