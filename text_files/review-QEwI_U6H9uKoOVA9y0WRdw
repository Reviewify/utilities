I have to say that I was disappointed. The chocolate frappe was nasty; far too much chocolate syrup, each sip was painfully chocolate and sweet.\n\nThe burger didn't taste right; I can't quite define it, but somehow it tasted kind of *off*. Almost as if it had gone slightly bad. Perhaps it was just a bad batch of meat.\n\nThe onion rings were on the flavorless side, and too bound together; it simply wasn't possible to eat them all. The fries were excellent, as was the pickle.\n\nThe price was godawful. $42 for dinner for three, one of whom was a kid? Not counting tip? That's insane. Bartley's loses two stars in my book!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg"}
