CHEAP.\n\nThe Alpha Sig Plate is my personal favorite. Love how they cook the Chicken Katsu here too. And DAMN do they give you a lot of food!\n\nBest cheap eat: $2.50 for the largest Hum Bow you've ever seen. MMMMM YES.\n\nHuge menu with pictures of all the plates to help you.\n\nThe food and the deals here will make you forget that it can sometimes be not so clean on the inside - it can get busy and they usually don't have more than 2 or 3 people working, but of course carry out is always an option too.\n\nGO. HERE. NOW!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cvDsVQAPUd3-9MgzskbN8g"}
