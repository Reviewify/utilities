The regular orders are cheeseburgers and the roasted chicken.  The cheeseburger seems to be good -- there are better ones around but not so many in this neighborhood.  \n\nThe chicken seems to be a whole other level of quality.  If you go there at dinner time, every seat will be filled, and almost everyone will be eating the roasted chicken dinner.  If you go to a restaurant named \"Olympian Burgers\", which is obviously an old-school L.A. Greco-American burger stand like so many others (Jim's, Cypress, Pete's, Tommy's), and the most popular dish is a Mexican-style roasted half chicken, you can guess that it's the best thing on the menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sAf2xtvoAzDAyWq3YO11Cg"}
