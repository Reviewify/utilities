The cashier seemed friendly enough. The drink itself was a whole other story. I ordered three different drinks and all three were just not appetizing. Two taro milk teas and one green milk tea and I was never going back again. The taro milk tea not only tasted powdery, but it also had too much water. It wasn't flavorful and tasted like water mixed with powder. The so called \"honey boba\" also tasted more like water boba. The boba was not sweet at all. The green milk tea was probably the worst I've ever had. It was sweet as if a not ripe fruit had been added to it, and watery. Overall, it was just downright the worst boba tea I've ever had. When it comes to food, I tend to be lenient especially towards boba, because come on, everyone loves boba regardless. But this one time was the first time I just had to say no. Not only that, but the prices are high too. While a milky boba + pudding at Half & Half or Honey Boba costs 3.75-4.25, a milk tea with only one topping at Teaboba is already 4.25. Half&Half and Honey Boba both have a wider variety and are much better. For boba, Teaboba is a place I'm going to have to miss next time.", "business_id": "VKH8b3YJ1P0sjbxqKdYBRA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-28", "type": "review"}
