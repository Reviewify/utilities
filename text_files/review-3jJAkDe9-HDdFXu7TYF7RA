I will say I liked the bulk vinegar, peanut butter, and oil section in back.  That said, while I liked the product, the service was aloof to say the least - especially compared with the ever-present smiles at WF.  While it is definitely nice to support local business, really, would it be that difficult to smile?  \n\nGreat selection - rude and uninterested service - we'll split the difference and go with 3 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4Y2CBdnmIy6-HZAfNCuh5w"}
