I used to come to this store all the time when I lived in SaMo, before the big new WF at 22nd & Wilshire was built.\nOne time I was eating salad at one of those lil tables, watching the UCLA crowd walk by, when Tyra Banks appeared out of nowhere.  That was before she had her own show, and I still liked her......\n\nI love all the huge new Whole Foods stores that are popping up, and I don't mind the older, smaller Whole Foods stores, like this location, because they have a certain charm.  In this store, you have to take a service elevator downstairs to the tiny bathroom.\nAnd the parking lot.....well, they watch it like a hawk, so don't overstay your welcome or you might get towed.\n\nThe hot & cold food bars at this store are excellent, to serve the needs of many people on the move in this neighborhood.  Without WF prepared foods, I'd surely starve.\n\nWhich brings me to my latest discovery:  Whole Kids meals.\nNow don't laugh, but I picked one up today for my dinner.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q27xEJjmTVLH4GywA1DmUg?select=XyKZT62vgT-mhdz40b5g1w\nI was poking around the cold cases, looking for something light to bring home for supper, and, for $3.65, the kids meal looked damn good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/q27xEJjmTVLH4GywA1DmUg?select=KAGVPcdP-gZpEAcyEmhRGQ\nI added a couple of WF turkey meatballs that I purchased separately, nuked it all up, and voila.....dinner is served....for 5 bucks.\n\nI'm a kid at heart, this much I already knew.  Apparently, my stomach has jumped on this bandwagon.  Next thing you know, I'll be getting visibly younger, just like Brad Pitt.......\n\nThank you Whole Foods!  \n\nAnyone for hopscotch?  Jump rope?  \nWait.  What do you mean it's past my bedtime.....", "type": "review", "business_id": "q27xEJjmTVLH4GywA1DmUg"}
