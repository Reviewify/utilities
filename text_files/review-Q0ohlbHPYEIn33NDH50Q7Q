If they ever close shop, I really would not know how I will survive. Maybe if that day ever happen, I would pack my bags and move to the Middle East. Ok, I sound a bit dramatic but it is because I am craving their garlic as I am writing this! I love Zankou's chicken tarna the best. The chicken is so flavorful, moist, and tender. D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. Their garlic is the best thing that ever was created to mankind. I usually ask for a double garlic and would get a reaction out of the worker. The worker would tell me that there is already a side of garlic with every order. I have no shame in letting them know that I usuallly consume two sides of garlic - all by myself. In my eyes, the more the better. If I can be drenched in garlic, I would do so in a heartbeat!  I always order the tarna wrapped in a pita with veggies. A bite of this with a huge scoop of garlic per bite is how I devour this wonderful creation. Nom, nom, nom!! Tip: Cash only.
