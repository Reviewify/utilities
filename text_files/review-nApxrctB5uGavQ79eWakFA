Their tom yum soup is just the right combo of spiciness and flavor. Great pad thai and pad see ew. I've also tried their ginger and scallion and eggplant delight which was also fantastic. You can tell i've been here a few times right?  And last but not least, the fried ice cream....I think i'm gonna have to make another trip there sometime soon. :-)", "business_id": "1dGQF0sqCghhOntdkcyycw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-12", "type": "review"}
