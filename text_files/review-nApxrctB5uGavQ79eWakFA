Great pad thai and pad see ew. I've also tried their ginger and scallion and eggplant delight which was also fantastic. You can tell i've been here a few times right? \n\nAnd last but not least, the fried ice cream....I think i'm gonna have to make another trip there sometime soon. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "1dGQF0sqCghhOntdkcyycw"}
