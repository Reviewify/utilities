This used to be my go-to place for cheap dining when I was a student in the Boston area.  The Thailand Cafe served as my introduction to Thai cuisine, but ironically, nothing here is authentic. It's run by a Chinese couple but the cheapness and portions are not to be dismissed.  I tried almost all the seafood and vegetable entrees.  Here are my favorites that I used to religiously rotate through on every visit:  -Pad thai with shrimp -Seafood noodle (yellow egg noodle stir-fried with shrimp, squid, scallops and vegetables) -Pattaya Squid ( tender fresh squid sauteed with fresh carrot, sweet basil, onion, mushroom & green peppers in a spicy sauce) -Fisherman's Fury (stir-fried scallops, large shrimp, mussels & squid, in our famous thai hot chili sauce with fresh mixed vegetable) -Salmon Choo Chee (grilled salmon steak in famous thai choo chee curry sauce with onion, tomato, green pepper, pineapple and sweet basil) Honestly, the place is a hole-in-the wall, and it's located in sketchy Central Square. But it never stopped me from ordering take out or hauling my @ss over there when I had a craving for some Asian cookin'!", "business_id": "1zIz2bfmX84YAYY6UTI0_w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-12", "type": "review"}
