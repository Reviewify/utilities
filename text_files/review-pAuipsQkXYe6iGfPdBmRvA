If it is cold out, I enjoy their veg gumbo otherwise I typically order their naked veggie burrito with tortilla soup.  They have a great customer rewards program too - be sure to pick one up (you just have to register the card on-line before you can use it).  Every tenth entree is free.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BU6FTbHe38g3Enbi077fVA"}
