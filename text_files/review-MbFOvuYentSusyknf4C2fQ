The place was packed. Our waiter was very nice and did a great job. But, the food was just not as I had hoped. I have heard such great things and was expecting to be wowed ~ just wasn't. Got the farm egg with celery cream not impressed at all. Got the fried grits good but maybe a tabasco butter sauce or something to go with it. The oysters small and fried just right ~ sauce way to much vinegar. Dinner we got the rabbit with the grits, the gravy was very watery and need to be reduced. Not much rabbit in the dish had trouble finding it? The grits had not been cooked enough. Did not eat any of the dish and was not even asked if I enjoyed it and if it was okay? We got the trout and it was liked by all. Had some nice wines. The coconut cake was light with a seven minute frosting was very enjoyable. It was our anniversary and this was noted on open table reservations was not acknowledged by any one at Miller's Union? Most places do acknowledge a birthday or anniversary? I am giving them a rather low mark just due to lack of interest and the food was way below what I could do at home.", "business_id": "bcx5R5pI3CLHMoMKD204Sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-07", "type": "review"}
