I think these are the best cup cakes you can get in the bay area.  The shop is SMALL, very small, but hey.. also cupcakes are small.. are they? Just drop by while shopping in Palo Alto shopping mall.. and here you go... you can sit outside under the trees and enjoy the weather. I was lucky all the time I got there... weather was always PERFECT!! Ok... you might get a queue of people outside the door, but do not get discouraged... it is moving always very fast.... and once you are inside.. .TA DAAAAAA.... gorgeous colorful and mouth watering cupcakes are waiting for you ... and your wallet :) It is not cheap but totally worth the price. Do not let yourself get annoyed by kids, it is a sweets shops, the natural playground for youngsters. WELL DONE. My MUST STOP place when I am down on the Peninsula in Palo Alto/Stanford. P.S. Keep the door closed.... the temperature inside is the perfect one for the perfect cupcakes!! :)", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-05", "type": "review"}
