It is surreal.  There always seems to be a line...Mr Bartley sits out on the street, about 40 feet away from the restaurant and hands out menus, and takes your order.  A runner takes the orders in and Mrs. Bartley processes the order.  There must have been 30 people in front of us, yet when we arrived at the front door, she greets us with our order.  Seating is communal.  You sit together with your party, but you are part of 2 or three really long tables.   The burgers themselves are fresh ground, and you can taste the quality, although I found them just to be a bit on the boring side.  I do enjoy a burger that is seasoned before being formed into patties...if it doesn't taste great on it's own (no toppings) then your burger will fall a bit short I think.  Just my preference.   Now the key to this burger is the crust.  There is a crispy, delicious crust on the burger that just sets this burger off.  Amazing.  ...I wish the one big pattie was split into 2 smaller patties instead so you could maximize the crust.   There are lots of burgers to choose from on the menu, choose what you like, and there is ketchup, pickles, mustard and a chutney I think on the table.  The fundamental burger is good and fresh so whatever you add will just make it better.  Get it cooked right though.  You have to go for a perfect medium here.  Trust me, just do it and enjoy. 3.5 Stars", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-21", "type": "review"}
