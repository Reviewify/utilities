BUT... 1) I had just finished my last class for the quarter (yipee!) 2) I had a 5-hour shift at work right after lunch (I will definitely burn some calories from constantly moving around) and 3) I had been craving a nice juicy burger for a couple of days now! I went here during the lunch time rush hour. The place was busy, but with a couple of empty tables here and there.  At the register counter, you get to customize your burger by filling out a sheet specifying what type of patty (meat), cheese, extras, veggies (free), sauce (free), and side orders/drinks you want. (Check out the photo I uploaded of the form w/ prices!) Then you hand it over to the cashier who adds up all the various prices for the add-ons. It took about 5 mins to get my food, which wasn't bad at all. I ordered a chicken breast burger, w/ american cheese, all the FREE veggies, and a side order of curly fries. I have to admit, the burger was solid! I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chicken was perfect- a bit crispy on the outside, but moist and tender in the inside. The portion size was a winner as well. As for the curly fries, they were amazing! Seasoned well, hot, crispy, and... curly? They really do give you a lot too! Other pros: free wi-fi, good service, and a big LCD TV (I was able to watch for updates on the tsunami/earthquake situation in Japan) All in all, I will DEFINITELY be coming back here the next time I have a strange, out-of-nowhere craving for burgers. But why not 5-stars? - It adds up to be a bit pricey for a poor college kid as myself. (My total was $8.25) - Doesn't beat Red Mill (my fav!) (Phew, that was a long review. But it was my very first Yelp review, so thanks for reading!)", "business_id": "NuvWsd7os1l6Pp4Map1xPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-11", "type": "review"}
