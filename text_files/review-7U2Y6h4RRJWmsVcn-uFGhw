There are looots of options. You can pay to get pre-made food by weight. Or you can order from a variety of things on their menu. I think the food here is legit and good. You can also order meat by the pound here, like gyro meat, if you can't find it at the grocery store.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rjW33uw9o5k1x5SlRaZfng"}
