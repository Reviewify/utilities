(the special) mango habanero chicken: sweet and spicy, very juicy! top dog will always have a special place in my heart. sausage of your choice grilled at command on a seasoned iron flat top, served in a toasty sesame bun, and topped to your heart's desire with onions, relish, (sauerkraut, mustard,) and ketchup... its berkeley's finest. the guys behind the grill can be moody and curse having to serve up rowdy drunk college students, but they are also witty and fun when you catch them in a good mood. i'll miss all this now that i'm gone, but i'm sure to stop back whenever i come visit!", "business_id": "qHmamQPCAKkia9X0uryA8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-30", "type": "review"}
