Pretty much everything that i have tried there has been above average, but not spectacular.  I can definitely feel confident that whatever i order there will taste pretty good.  Their specials are very intriguing and usually tasty.  The only thing i would not recommend are the filet mignon tacos....  They are not bad, but just eh, nothing special.  I am a big fan of their shrimp and sausage pasta though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ekd4p4JmygAgzoaR4jFMJQ"}
