We had seen their menu online, but didn't see any prices, so we thought we'd check it out. \n\nWe arrived around 6 pm on a Saturday and walked in the garden area. There didn't seem to be anyone greeting people so we kind of wandered around, feeling like idiots  and finally found a gentleman standing in a hallway behind a closed door. I asked if the way we came in was the wrong way, and he said no. I felt like I went through a corn maze to find someone to ask for a lousy menu. He gave us the menu, and at the same time said \"you know the wait is 2 hours\". Wow, was that a snooty response!  Well, that was good to know, but we had already eaten an excellent meal, and just wanted to check the menu and facilities out. \n\nWhile we were looking at the menu, I looked through and adjoining window to what appeared to be one of their dining rooms, which looked like a long narrow room with long tables, like something in a cafeteria.  \n\nI can't review this place for food because we would never wait for 2 hours to eat, and then according to the posts I've been reading, be given a time limit to eat, especially after waiting 2 hours to get in. Who would ever order dessert at the same time they're ordering their appetizers and entrees?   \n\nWe go out to relax and enjoy really good food. Based on my first impression, the only thing this place would give me is a headache. Anyone got any Excedrin?", "type": "review", "business_id": "fUBqSWOI5EkyXboVvov4hA"}
