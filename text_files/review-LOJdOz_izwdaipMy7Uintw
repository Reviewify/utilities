Sometimes its a bit pricey on some items and I just can't get myself to pay that much.  I always find some great things in here, they are always playing good music, and always have super good deals on scarves. They have vintage goodies from many eras I would say from the 40's and up. Sometimes the kids who work here think they are a little too cool for their own good, but what do you expect all of these stores are like this. Forsure one of the best vintage stores in this area. Thats my two cents.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjpsMGriV3-HM-mTH2j90g"}
