The first thing that struck me was: EXPENSIVE. The bowl itself was around $4 and each 1/2 cup add in (spinach, mushroom, peas, mango, etc. was $1, protein was $2). Adds up to around $8-$10 for a bowl of stir-fry. Afterwards, you chose a sauce-- the sauces looked like salad dressing, but tasted pretty good. Then they brought the food into the back and stir fried it. The speed was great, decor was fine, but the food... my brown rice/ veggies were submerged in OIL. The bubble tea was okay-- good for being one of the only places to get it.", "business_id": "rdCr5KnqfT5IsTOCfCmwfA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-03-29", "type": "review"}
