Oh yeah, and the food is good too. There are two main places to sit, upstairs in the dinning area or downstairs in the bar/patio area. Hands down the bar/patio area is better. Relieves the expectations of a restaurant like atmosphere and concentrates on the hopefully good company and care free Austin nature. I will not lie to you, it is crowded and parking is a challenge, BUT once you have claimed a spot to park and a place to sit, the mexican martini is a reward in its self. So go, be patient and enjoy.", "business_id": "fL_ilXgNUq_j9vMpZwdcLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-03", "type": "review"}
