I've been going to this place since it first opened back in 1996 at the old buckhead location. This is by far the best NY style pizza in the Atlanta area. The grilled Greek salad is awesome, the chicken is so plump and juicy its like they just cooked it. I like the midtown location cause they offer Mediterranean food, I mean who doesn't like a restaurant that serves amazing pizza with stuffed grape leaves and tabbouleh salad, ugghhhh my stomach is growling just writing this review. nough said", "business_id": "T1e6j0v42g9GElB6qbnIQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-21", "type": "review"}
