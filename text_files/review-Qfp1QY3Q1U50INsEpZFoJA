They were so good that they drove the other Italian place across the street to extinction within a few months. I also cycles through their menu as a Berkeley student and I have two favorite dishes:  - Pasta Bolonese fills the tummy and is one of the six dishes on special during their lunch hours. Perfect for the budget conscious.  - Chicken Marsala is my ultimate favorite because they give me a fat piece of chicken with angel hair-like pasta drizzled with a wine sauce and some wine-soaked mushrooms. Protein, check; carbs, check; mushroom nutrients, check. Although sometimes when the mushrooms taste too wine-y I don't eat all of them.  When they just opened, I came with a friend and they served us complimentary bruschetta. How nice! :) Alas, now they are too popular!  The ambience of the restaurant is relaxing too. The cute old Italian couple who operates the restaurant also add to the ambience. Perfect for gatherings or for casual dates (which I see all the time...)", "business_id": "QQIjsdcokFermi2ugoD6ow", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-06", "type": "review"}
