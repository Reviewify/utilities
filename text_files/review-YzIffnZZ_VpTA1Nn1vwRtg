So we check Yelp and discover this place. We shoulda tried the shakes instead.\n\nWe ordered the truffle fries and some chili to split for a starter; both were surprisingly bland, though the cornbread that came with the chili was all right for what seemed like a mix. I ordered the French dip; blaaaaand. So bland. The salad I got as the side was way better (especially with the bleu cheese dressing). My wife got the fish and chips special (red snapper!), and we agreed it was the tastiest thing on the table, though our son disagreed and spat it out. We should've listened to him: I ended up swallowing a knot of fish bones, and we all ended up riding the porcelain bus later that night.\n\nMaybe, maybe we'll be back to try the shakes or the tasty-looking desserts. But not likely. Certainly not at what we paid for a mediocre, gastrointestinal distress-inducing meal, though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KG3Y2qyrru2SZxR_c5gHyg"}
