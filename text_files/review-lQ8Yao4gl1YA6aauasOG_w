I conisder myself extremely lucky to have graduated from such a prestigious and well-respected university. \nWhenever you tell people you graduated from Cornell, they automatically think you are a genius or at the very least super smart. I was just one of those fortunate dudes from Southern California that was able to graduate from an Ivy League institution. \nAt times I questioned my decision. The weather was brutal. Being from Chula Vista, CA the cold Ithaca winters wore me down. However, the education is second to none, and you are constantly being challenged to do your best and improve upon your previous academic successes. \nBeing an alumnus opens doors for you- no doubt about it! \n \nWhat I hated:\nThe weather- TOO COLD AND DREARY! Sometimes I didn't see the sunshine for 5 days straight. The lake effect blows!\nBeing so far from California!\nThe Greek System. \nMy Harvard and Princeton-educated academic advisor- the guy was an arrogant jerk \nCut-throat attitude of most New Yorkers in my classes\n\nWhat I love(d):\nSchoellkopf Field\nWillard Straight Hall\nSage Chapel\nThe whole campus- especially the Gorges\nThe friends I made\nFriday nights\nPlaying lightweight football\nSome of my professors\nSlope Day.\nDragon Day.\nThe faculty.\nWines course- who doesn't love a buzz in the early afternoon.\nThe memories and a bunch of other stuff.\n\n\nAll in all, I am glad I went to Cornell; but I wish more than just one of my undergraduate buddies lived on the west coast .\n\nLiving and working in the SF Bay Area it most likely would have been more advantageous had I graduated from Berkeley or Stanford, but I love my alma mater nonetheless!\n\nGO BIG RED forever!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Rl2_H4wcEuts7NC_HbDOpQ"}
