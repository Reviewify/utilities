I looked around the Web a little at the major chains, and for what you get at zPizza, the prices are good. I got an XL pizza for $16, by using a coupon available on their Web site. I could also have gotten two smaller pizzas for $10. I remember paying up to $30 for similar pizzas in other, more artesanal shops, where adding an ingredient can cost you $3 each.\n\nAt zPizza I got an XL with at least 4 toppings for just $16. It was tasty, part organic, whole wheat crust and fast, and the employees were very friendly and informative.\n\nPlus, they have vegan cheese and sausage, which tells me that they care about giving their customers healthier food and also about being a pizza place for everyone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MPOLq2K771xngu7_CjXKQA"}
