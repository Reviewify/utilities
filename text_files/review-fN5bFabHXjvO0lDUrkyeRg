I always start with a meat & cheese plate, followed by a salad (most recently grilled radicchio with house smoked bacon & pickled fennel...yum). And finally one of their superb pasta dishes. My final course is usually olive oil ice cream and excellent coffee. My husband & I like to walk here when we are staying in Midtown at the Hotel Palomar. Oh & let me not forget about the mussels my daughter offered last night. She is something of a \"mussels connoisseur\" & said these were among the best she's ever had. Loved that the broth had a wonderfully savory cheese flavor.", "business_id": "rP90TP7gOMzBFTrKWEEsOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}
