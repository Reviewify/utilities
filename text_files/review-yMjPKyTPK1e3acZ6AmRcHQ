Case in point: I drove about 3 miles round trip, but when I went to place gas in the truck it took 30$ and kept sucking the petrol. I showed dude my receipts and he was nice enough to give me a 20$ credit for my next move. Fine.    I rented again. The truck was ok. I used my credit and only paid 6 bucks for a smaller truck the second time. A one ton. Thanks. Still sucked lots extra gas to get it truly full. This location sure is convenient.", "business_id": "Hx-H-CK89WF5pQDwesbVqw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-06-30", "type": "review"}
