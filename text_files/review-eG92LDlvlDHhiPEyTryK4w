The Flyers, Phillies, Sixers, and Eagles are always on and lots of fans frequent the B-Stone for beers and Philly sports talk.  The walls are covered with Philly sports memorabilia, as well as a chalkboard listing the city's four major teams and their most recent championships.  The bartenders are all extremely personable and friendly, and you can get any kind of bottled beer you can imagine.  All of this at Blarney adds up to a top-notch sports bar.\n\nAside from being a great place to watch the game, Blarney has the best Quizzo in the city every Tuesday night.  The theme of the second round is chosen by the team that scored lowest the week before, so Blarney Quizzo regulars tend to know the theme in advance.  Thursday night is Sink or Swim (50 cent drinks with a $5 cover) and Saturday is karaoke.  Every night of the week is a rockin good time at the Blarney Stone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mpVZG520RL-K1YeQi55ZPg"}
