My college years were rife with rumors of Dunkin Donuts and convenience stores buying the space, and more rumors about their being sewage issues and evil landlords. Finally, someone has pulled the renovation and opened its doors once more. Noodles & Company is vastly popular already; not sure if that's because of the legend of the venue, the newness of the restaurant, or the actual awesomeness of the food. Here's my impression. It's an order-at-the-counter joint, kind of similar to Chai's, but with less 'wow' with regards to the food. I was surprised to see the menu divided into 3 categories -- Asian, Mediterranean, and American. This gives diversity among tastes, but narrows what's available in each category. My friend and I both went the Asian route -- she got Pad Thai; I ordered an Indonesian peanut sauce noodle bowl. A size small is only $5.95 when you add your choice of meat/tofu. Service was friendly and fast, despite the crowds. They were a little negligent in cleaning off tables, but this is probably only because they're still gaging staffing needs. We sat on the patio, which is one of the nicest street patio spots on Franklin (set off from the road and fairly large). Given its location and price-point, I can see how this will be a student favorite for sure.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eSnm_YS5lBu8pC_dXKwH5A"}
