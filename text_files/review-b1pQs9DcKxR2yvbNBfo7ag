If you have that same type of commitment and love for your little one, then you will LOVE this pet boutique.  First, the shop owner puts her heart into this boutique, which is reflected in the quality of everything.  It is as if the owner wants to provide the community with the same loving opportunity that she provides for her own adorable poodle.  Second, the owner is well connected to the bay area pet community. This makes it possible to go to her for recommendations on quality trainers, products, and local vets. It is easy to tell that she really has done her research while making thoughtful connections.  Third, the items in the shop could be priced much higher due to the high quality.  Yet, the owner tries her best to keep everything affordable. You will find products for dogs of all shapes, sizes, and kinds.  There is even a small section for our feline friends.  Finally, my puppies love coming! The owner always welcomes them with treats. She is very giving! I highly recommend checking this little gem out! San Francisco has George. Now, The Peninsula now has Touleh! yay!!!", "business_id": "a3oVy0OFg_zTLs8V7UGv0Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-11", "type": "review"}
