I usually go to the one in Meyerland because it's close to work. This was the first time I had ever been to this location.  It was a Friday night and it was really crowded. Luckily they were able to seat us quickly. The service was good, although our server seemed a little frazzled. He missed out on some opportunities to make more money - if he had offered me a side salad or an additional glass of wine, I would have said yes. But since he didn't ask, I wasn't as tempted. The seating was a little cramped and they sat us next to the patio door. Every time the pizza delivery guy went in and out I got a burst of cold air. That wasn't pleasant, but it's not really the restaurant's fault - they're doing their best with a very small sized restaurant.  The food was delicious as always. I adore the complimentary bread. I had the manicotti and it was great. As was the red wine. Prices were right too. I always leave Gugliani's full and satisfied.", "business_id": "Ws5jW7K4OgADEly5cCmsXg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}
