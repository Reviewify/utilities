I went here a few weeks ago where i met my current employers who offered me my current job so Westegg Cafe has good memories for me.  I had the benedict georgia breakfast i believe it was called.  It was the first time i had ever had poached eggs.  They were on top of fluffy biscuits which were smothered with sawmill gravy.  The breakfast was very tasty and velvety.  Service was good.  Go eat here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4NtLqqnDPJjeCbrys1zpdw"}
