There's some interesting Texas style things going on with the walls. Seating is tight inside and you will be surrounded by people standing in line. It's a little hot and outside area is usually hot too. It's Houston. Be prepared for that. The BBQ is good. Nothing I crave though. The jalapeno bread isn't much. It's better than a slice of Mrs. Bairds or something but it's not awesome by any means. As with all BBQ places I've tried, they usually don't have clue how to make any decent sides. The sides here are so-so. Not completely as bad as other BBQ places but still so-so. Now, I do have to say there's a story behind eating sides at this Goode Company BBQ. One night we went there and I had the Austin baked beans. The beans went to work quickly. Shortly after leaving I farted in the car while driving up Kirby. It smelled like pure hell I won't lie! So bad in fact my wife threw open the car door and barfed on the road. She doesn't think Goode Co. is all that good. lol!", "type": "review", "business_id": "F-CnLwWvidsZqR9pLUrcBw"}
