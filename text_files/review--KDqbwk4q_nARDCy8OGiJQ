That said, this is one of the smallest Yogurtland locations I have seen. All of the seating is outside (not different from Sawtelle), but here, there were only three tables. I dispensed myself a cup of lemon lime tart and mango tart. Both were just as I imagined. The lemon lime did have some bite to it. The consistency wasn't abnormal in any way, but I know that is something that tends to be a problem at Yogurtlands. I'm guessing it's more an issue of negligent machine maintenance than being stingy with flavor concentrate. I'm no expert, however. I've always been intrigued by their water dispensers. With strawberries floating around inside, you'd think that the water might have a slight strawberry twinge to it. Rather, it didn't taste anything like strawberry. In fact, it tasted more like unfiltered tap water. -1.", "business_id": "NxmRPUDi2UGnj6moH0mKAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-07", "type": "review"}
