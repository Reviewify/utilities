I'll never forget the time I visited the ER at this hospital. The lady who drew my blood was ON HER CELL PHONE, while preparing to take my blood. When I tried to tell her where people who drew blood in the past have been more successful (while she was still on the phone) she says \"I know what I'm doing sir, I've been doing this for a while now.\" Well, I guess she was too much of a pro to find the vein because she had to call in another person to find the vein. ASIDE from this ONE employee, the rest of the staff were wonderful. So please don't let the issue I had with one \"DA\" form your opinion for the Hospital as a whole. Her incompetence and inconsiderate behavior is why I say, this is an OK hospital.", "business_id": "ohf5OHwTrXcStQ5Vn1wbEQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-29", "type": "review"}
