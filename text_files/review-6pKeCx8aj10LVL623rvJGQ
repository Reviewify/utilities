A nice addition to the dining scene. The sauces were each unique and delicious. They are not afraid to spice it up so order the heat as you'd really like it. The Nan was very good as well. Service was very attentive. We had three servers waiting on us. They were very sweet with our four year old. We had Chicken Sagwala, Chicken Vindaloo, Shrimp Curry and Pindi Chana Masala. The Vegetarian combination appetizer platter was ok if a bit too much fried stuff. Mango Kulfi for dessert was surprisingly good. They told me the buffet at lunch is fantastic. I look forward to trying it. Lacking wine and beer right now but working on it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oidBvZouxEal1NWe5ARrVw"}
