I love love love the White Pizza! The basil & ricotta cheese has such a simple, yet rich, flavor that pleases my taste buds, finished off with the CRUNCH of the crispy crust. I could probably eat 2 or 3 slices of that thing, & these are huge NY style slices I'm talking about! The deep dish slices are also very yummy, I really like how the crust has a good flavor too, so once you get to it you don't feel like you're just eating a thick piece of plain bread, but rather a tasty bread stick! You'd think that a deep dish slice of pizza would be dripping in grease due to all the cheese & toppings, but the slices here actually aren't too bad, so you don't finish your meal with shiny fingers. Single slices are big & relatively inexpensive, $3 +/- $0.50 per slice. You can buy whole pizzas, pastas, calzones, salads, & sandwiches  here too. They also serve Ale Smith beer, bonus points!  Nice indoor seating area, some tables outside for nicer days. Not too spacious given their plaza location, so I wouldn't recommend big parties. Order at the counter, they bring the food out to you. Overall, a great place to chill with your buds while enjoying some good eats.", "business_id": "XqKhC29UQ1ya1Py3bTzvAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-18", "type": "review"}
