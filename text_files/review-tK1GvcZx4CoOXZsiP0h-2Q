Here's why: My friends and I arrived at around 10:30 on Saturday, January 8th for a night of drinks and dancing.  From the back of the line to the door, it took us about 30-45 minutes, but we were determined to get in and felt committed after having waited so long.  While we waited, we noticed several people allowed to cut the line and walk in ahead of us.  These were not smokers either, they had just arrived.  We thought nothing of it until we thought our group was about to be let in and then suddenly a group of about 15 people showed up.  The people at the door told us this crew had made a reservation and therefore would be entering before us.  As one might imagine, we were quite pissed at this point.  I will never go back to Zuzu again and neither should you.  They do not care about their business coming off the street at all and clearly see their friends as more important than paying customers who have waited an hour to get in at this point.  Also, places that small shouldn't take reservations FOR DANCING, certainly not for that many people (they have one room!).  We finally gave up and went to another bar.  Screw Zuzu.", "business_id": "GLP0_Rs2y4Q0Gxk7r1dddQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}
