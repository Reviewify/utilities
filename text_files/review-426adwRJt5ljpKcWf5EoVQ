The food & service was absolutely superb and it was a brilliant value AND I don't have a single negative thing to say, I have to give them five stars!!! What we ordered: Lamb Empanadas - dough was cripsy & crunchy & the lamb was flavourful & moist Costa Patagonia (Flat grilled pacific prawns, scallops and calamari in a paprika-garlic sauce) - shrimp were delicious! calamari, a little chewy & scallops were just really small.  Did have to put a light shower of salt on the dish Entrana al Chimichurri (Skirt steak basted with a traditional Argentinean light chimichurri sauce served with fresh grilled vegetables ) - D I V I N E!!!  Steak was tender & succulent Sorrentinos (Traditional Argentinean ravioli stuffed with imported italian ham, smoked mozzarella and asparagus, served in a light pink sauce with mushrooms) - Sooooooooooooo good!!!  The sauce was oh so yum, I kept stealing spoonfuls to ladle over my steak, mmmmmmm The service was REALLY great too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-19", "type": "review"}
