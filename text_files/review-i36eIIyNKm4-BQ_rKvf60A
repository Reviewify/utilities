In my opinion, one of the best sandwiches because it comes with cream cheese, tomatoes, red onions and capers. I got the sandwich on a jalapeno cheese bagel (extra $0.30), with extra tomatoes and red onions (another extra $0.30). I didn't know the veggies would've been extra, but it was a good amount of extra for just a lil more than a quarter. BUT, I got my sandwich, and I definitely got the extra veggies, but was missing the capers! The capers are the best part of the sandwich (in my opinion!) and they definitely forgot them :(((( super sad face I also got a medium hazelnut coffee to go with my brunch. I don't think they have anything on Dunkin Donuts, just saying. Overall, I'd come back to Bruegger's when I need my smoked salmon fixed (making sure they put the capers!) because it's a nice clean spot with a lot of seats and free wifi.", "business_id": "A0e-tQr8h6nZ7a9VzZMgCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-12", "type": "review"}
