My husband and I recently spent a  month in Australia and since we were going to hang out at the beach all day and every day, I decided to get my eyebrows done before I left.   I'm terrified of needles and any type of pain but Lauren made me feel at ease by explaining all of her tools and reassuring me that she will be using an anesthetic.  You can tell she is a perfectionist and she spent a lot of time making sure that my eyebrows were the same shape and aligned.     I love my new eyebrows and I can't wait to go back to her on February when she's running the special on permanent eyeliner.  Her prices are very reasonable and procedures also include 2 free touch-ups!", "business_id": "Ak5tpkoX3bJ9O6sagvay5w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-06", "type": "review"}
