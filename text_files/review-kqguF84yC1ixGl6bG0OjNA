They have menu's;  I feel it's cheating to use them.\n\nWhat you have to do is check out all the food and order individual items by the pound.  It's difficult to remember all the names and turn them into quantities that are appropriate for 2 or 3 people. \n\nAlways buy a bag of the fresh pita bread and half a pound of one of several hummus.  Then, sardines, moussaka, eggplant stew (great), stuffed grape leaves,  lentils, cauliflower - it's all good!  You order at the counter, take a number and wait for it.  Nothing fancy, just good.\n\nFinally, if you have room choose a dessert.  I think it's the halva that I like.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rjW33uw9o5k1x5SlRaZfng"}
