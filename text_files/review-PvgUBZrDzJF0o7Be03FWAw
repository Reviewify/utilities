Cafe Intermezzo is the type of restaurant that will make you go out of your way if you are craving it. The bread is hearty and freshly baked. They have a sandwich menu that will satisfy the pickiest hippy/vegan diner and enough quality meat to keep a New Yorker happy! Yes they are mostly a sandwich shop but their salads are nothing to scoff at either. The greatest thing about this spot is that everything is always incredibly fresh. The flavors on their dressings and sauces are unique and flavorful! Everything is made from scratch and nothing is left to chance. They even have soups, blended teas and an espresso bar! The service has a bit of that snobby, I'm better than you vibe, that seems to spew from the younger residents of Berkley because they believe they are saving Mother Earth and you are not, but it moves along and they are quick and helpful! Extra bonus is an easy access toilet! These are hard to come by on Telegraph street. Just remember to buy something first!", "business_id": "j0C1t08TLW_iPPdC-8P_vQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}
