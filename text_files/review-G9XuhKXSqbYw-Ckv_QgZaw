I had the grilled salmon with some fresh vegetables and garlic mash and all of it was tasty, but my favorite was the chicken empanada.  Didn't have enough room for dessert but want to try the crepes with dulce de leche and fruit with vanilla icecream!!!", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-24", "type": "review"}
