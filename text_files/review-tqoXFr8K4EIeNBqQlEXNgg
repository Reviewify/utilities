I am actually surprised that this IS the only affordable clothing boutique in Westwood!!! As a student, I can't buy designer clothes like \"Bebe\" and this store always has everything what I have been looking for! For a wide variety of events: from a wedding I had to attend, a summer pool party, a birthday party in Hollywood to a theatrical production, I found and bought all the necessary accessories and three of my favorite dresses! The owner of the store is very friendly and kind and she has always found a way to make me feel comfortable and welcome. I got great deals and I know that these dresses cost a lot more anywhere else. I highly recommend this store to students and thank you, because I have been saved for the past three years! My friends always ask me where I get my dresses from and all comment how great they look on me. :)", "business_id": "kYVx-v_e50aa_lHt5HflhQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-01", "type": "review"}
