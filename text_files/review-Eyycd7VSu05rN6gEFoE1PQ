KSPC is firmly committed to bringing you music you will not hear elsewhere on the radio, and it delivers.  Plus, unlike other college stations which don't properly train their DJs so every time they talk on the air you feel like you're slowly being tortured, KSPC DJs are well-trained and don't say \"um\" ten times in every sentence.  Do you like indie rock?  Jazz?  Classical?  Blues?  Polka?  Classic rock?  Children's music?  Video game music?  It's all here, plus much, much more.  You can listen on the radio at 88.7fm or via the webcast at kspc.org.  Sorry if this sounds like an ad, but if ever I felt a business deserved all five stars, this is it.  I love this radio station.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DrJ4cTp7CiWKI83dpDlt4w"}
