I've eaten the chocolate chip waffles, whole wheat pancakes and the lancaster omelette. All of these were pretty excellent, but I have to say that the lancaster omelette was reaaaaal heavy on the goat cheese which would be my only complaint. However, the waffles and the pancakes have really wonderful combinations of flavors that just make them perfect. My mouth waters every time I think about the lemon curd and blood orange syrup on those pancakes! Although this place is a little pricey, you can't beat unlimited $10 mimosas/bloody marys/greyhounds with brunch. I definitely get my moneys worth every time :)", "business_id": "ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-22", "type": "review"}
