The food has been consistently pretty decent with so-so service. I believe the best way to enjoy this place is probably for your lunch break, if you work or study in the area. Not super-cheap, but reasonable enough, and you're likely to walk away with some leftovers for later.", "business_id": "hKQsbxqTWumRK8OPk3uoEQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-10", "type": "review"}
