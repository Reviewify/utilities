My french dip was really good, and I enjoyed the coffee. However, their tiny bottomless cups of coffee are slow to be refilled. I constantly had to ask our waitress to pour more. Plus, my girlfriend's hot chocolate was watery and bland. I'll probably return again, especially for the happy hour food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
