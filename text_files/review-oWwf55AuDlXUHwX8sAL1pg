I'm a big In 'n Out fan, but I'll take Pie 'n Burger over it any day.  Fries vary -- sometimes they are excellent, sometimes merely acceptable.  But, as the sign says, you're there for the Pie and Burger, not fries.  Rhubarb pie is a must and boysenberry pie is the best I've had outside of the Pacific NW.  Love the decor -- wood paneling and mostly counter-eating.  I dream about this place.  If you have a friend in from the NW, be sure to take them here -- it's a sure thing.", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-06-17", "type": "review"}
