The stuff's not even steam-table food, it's all stone cold and if you get it heated it'll be in a microwave, generally with uneven results (hence the volcanic-to-chilly temperature range of the goat curry I had last week).  It's all adequately tasty for what it is, though.  Prices for entrees aren't spectacular -- there are a lot of steam-table places charging about the same or a little more for the same dishes, only adequately heated -- but the appetizers are a win: better than average quality at lower than average prices.  All in all, I think twice about sitting down to eat here, but it's a great place to get some samosas or pakoras if you're eating on the run.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B4iO8_F6rRe4i9efdfXstQ"}
