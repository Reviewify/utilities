I LOVE cookies, but $4.00 for a cookie the size of the ones offered at Levain seemed out of controls. Surely one can find better cookies elsewhere. Boy was I wrong. Perhaps (and I emphasize my conjecture here) one might be able to find bigger---or dare I say \"better\"---cookies elsewhere, but I doubt one can find a cookie in the city to rival Levain when it comes to the combined factors of size and freshness. As for the cookies, while I was a little upset that the chocolate chip cookie only came with walnuts, it didn't disappoint. The cookie was warm with an ideal \"crunchy-chewy ratio.\" The real gem, though, was the dark chocolate chocolate chip cookie (with extra dark French cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate chips). This cookie is not for the faint at heart. It was rich, chewy, with a pleasantly crispy \"shell\" and is guaranteed to leave you teetering on the edge of a food coma. Thank the lord I was smart enough to order milk instead of coffee. I fear what may happen if I go back and order the dark chocolate peanut butter chip. In short, Levain is a top-notch cookie bakery. Some may complain it's decision to remain simple and include only four types of cookies and a small selection of other pastries, but they've made a conscious decision to keep it simple and do the simple well. For that, I cannot fault them. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer a place that makes a few types of things very well than a place that makes a plethora of things of mediocre quality. If you share that sentiment, this is the place for you.", "business_id": "QHYqNQhQ8NVK0RX68Y4PuQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-30", "type": "review"}
