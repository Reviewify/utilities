Was told that it couldn't be done on that day so I made an appointment for today, Nov 1, 2010, at 10:00 a.m.  The counter guy was nice enough and seemed pretty friendly. I arrived for my scheduled oil change at 9:45.  It was raining a LOT this morning and I had my very well-behaved short-haired dog with me.  We got out of our car, went directly into the waiting room before getting soaked and sat at the end of the row of four seats.  My dog was leashed and sat at my feet for the few seconds we were there.  While the same guy from Saturday was checking in someone at the counter, he says: \"Can you take your dog outside?\"   It was pouring and about 54 degrees.  I said: \"He's just going to sit here at my feet, and he's on a leash.  Is that OK?\"  He says: \"We like to keep dogs outside, especially when it's raining\".  I thought to myself: \"This is an auto repair and tire shop, not a hospital.\"    Anyways, I got up, took my dog to the door and informed the guy to cancel my 10:00 appointment.  I'll find some other shop to change my oil, thank you very much.  That's pretty much it.", "business_id": "AY1DPKBe3pYpPF-j2boFgw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-11-01", "type": "review"}
