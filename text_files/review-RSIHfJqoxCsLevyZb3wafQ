I never think to come to Harvard Sq. yet it's practically in my back pocket. I'm glad I crossed the river the other weekend. The area is a cheap cab ride away, and it's a mecca for thirsty bar hoppers.  Started off with Grendel's Den. Chill place, very relaxed. Great for a starting off point. Great selection of beers that don't include the regulars. I ordered a Dark and Stormy, which totally did the trick. A round of drinks for 4 was incredibly reasonable, too. Toto, we're not in Boston anymore.  Overall, a great place to hit up for a beverage or two before moving on, or to camp out at with a few friends.", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-19", "type": "review"}
