Sad to say, I caved within a few weeks... The heightened standard of sandwiches after experiencing Milano's grandness has got to be a major problem in our area. It really just isn't fair!\n\nThey have a great variety of veggie sandwiches, which I really appreciate. My favorite are any of the ones with brie and/or pesto. They are not stingy with the brie, which I really appreciate!\n\nPlease Milano, be sympathetic to us poor college students--give student discounts, take part in various Groupon-esque deals! Anything before I spend all my student loans on your sandwiches alone!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JY576sTpB3ljay2IAajZ2w"}
