They no longer serve the dressing that I raved about in my previous review. So I take it all back -- do NOT get the salad and do NOT order the bottle of dressing. You will think I'm crazy because it's this icky, mayonnaisey, sweet, watery yuck; not the savory, gingery, sesame deliciousness of yesteryear. I've called a couple times to ask if they've brought back the original stuff yet, but no. They have not. Until then, there are better places in the hood to get sushi.", "business_id": "ezgJKW02TGymRkmLb8zzwQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}
