The other 1.5 is for providing sustenance in a presentable way. The pad thai was the best dish on our table, and while the noodles were alright, there wasn't that *pop* that it usually has.  The chicken was pretty dry. The beef panang was really dry and tough.  The sauce needed more heat.  Likewise, the beef in the beef salad was really dry and tough as well.  it's like they precooked a batch of beef, then just added it to whatever dish was ordered. The chicken fried wontons were ok, not bad for a snack. Service was friendly, and I feel bad that their food isn't so great.", "business_id": "Ubwb1bPFDMCfILgL2e1Mfw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-18", "type": "review"}
