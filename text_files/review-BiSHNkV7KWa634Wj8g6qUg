Deadwood Saloon is one of those I tried and came back to. I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon just in time to catch some college football on the TVs behind the bar. I ordered up a beer and a burger and had a great conversation with the bartender about football. The food was good for it being a bar. But what got me to come back, and what I'll go back for again, is the way the staff made me feel. I couldn't even pretend to live close to downtown if I tried, but the staff made me feel like I lived around the corner and that they saw me every Thursday and Saturday. Everybody was casual, friendly and funny. Definitely a keeper in midtown.", "business_id": "2D1p8n5iISodQ8LN9kZU2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-08", "type": "review"}
