There is one women (who wears wigs herself!) who is awesome -- so is so nice and really enjoys her job. If my only interaction had been with her, I would give this place 5 stars. The other woman who works there is very grumpy (she didn't want to get any wigs out for me to try on -- it was too much work for her, she also complained the whole time about her arthritis -- to a cancer patient!!). The manager isn't any nicer. It always seems like you are bothering her.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y9WmxqQB-HWCBCC3EMC3pg"}
