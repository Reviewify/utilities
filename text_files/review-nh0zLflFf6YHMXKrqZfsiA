There's a parking lot next to the restaurant.  Still felt a little snug with parking spaces/availability.  The menu had lots of options but not overloaded or skimpy. They had a daily lunch special with 3 options.  I tried the Chicken Cobb Salad.  I didn't look great but it tasted yummy.  I loved the jalapeno vinaigrette.  It wasn't too spicy or too bland.  Had the ice tea w/ mint.  The waiter said the mint it infused.  It was tasty!  Had to get one to go. Was seated very quickly, food came out in a snap, waiter checked on us and while juggling his station.  Manager or someone came to help and room our plates and she got out to go tea.  She was very approachable and friendly. Overall it was a good experience and good food.  I peeked at the drink menu and will definitely be back to try their flight or strawberry mojito (I saw the strawberry mojito on display in the entrance and it grabbed my attention).", "business_id": "OlknnWVWwtdSYkHSWCXmqg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-08", "type": "review"}
