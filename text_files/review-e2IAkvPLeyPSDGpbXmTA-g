Food is quite good with both traditional Mexican dishes and a few with Tex-Mex or Cajun influence.  Try the enchiladas, Tortilla Flats has one of the best tomatillo sauces in the greater Providence area. Expect to wait for a table on weekend nights, though they have a largish bar area and an extensive list of tequilas to make it worth your while.  I believe they take reservations for larger parties.", "business_id": "MGOt6JSu0NPI-DKhWRTTeA", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-02-06", "type": "review"}
