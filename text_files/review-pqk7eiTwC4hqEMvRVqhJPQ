The dosa itself was huge, but too thick and very soggy. The masala filling was okay but not good enough to make up for the poorly made dosa. The sambar was tangy, an absolute NO, and the coconut chutney tasted sweet - as if it had been made from dried sweetened coconut, not fresh ground coconut as it should be.\n\nNorth Indian restaurants just shouldn't put South Indian items on the menu at all. The sambar was terrible, it tasted more like rasam - clearly the cook didn't know what he/she was doing. Places like Caf\u00e9 of India should stick to Mughali/Punjabi fare and save their customers the disappointment of inauthentic food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "INaAXfbIXtXTB3sSDX8Wow"}
