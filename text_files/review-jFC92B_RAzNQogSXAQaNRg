It is authentically Italian in its simplicity and ease of comfort. Anyone can just walk right in this place, not knowing a thing about Italian wine, and enjoy a reasonably priced glass of something great. If one of the two owners are there, they are really knowledgeable about the wines and the waitstaff is pretty friendly and helpful as well. The ambiance is great. There are a handful of small, hardwood tables that can easily be squished together for larger groups and the menu is cleverly written on their chalkboard wall. Take a look up at the ceiling next time you're there and check out the awesome wine-bottle-light-fixtures.  Their brunch is banging. The selection is wide from braised beef cheek to a burger or just plain ol' grits. The last two times I went they offered sangria and a blood orange mimosa as the morning libation. Both were outstanding. Also, be sure to visit the restaurant when they do Beefsteak Sunday. It's an all-you-can-eat-and-drink of wine/beer and steak and potatoes for $25. Does life get any better than that?!", "business_id": "8polKN4I6fJx1t8pPxogVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-29", "type": "review"}
