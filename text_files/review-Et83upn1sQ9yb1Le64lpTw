In the same plaza as Imperial Bakery, there's a Flame Broiler, a teriyaki joint, pizza, and Popeyes chicken. They take cash only. Tres Leches Cake is $1.50 and the Coffee Tres Leches Cake is $2.50 and I liked the latter the best. It's a little lighter than most and it isn't over-soaked with milk. They have other cakes, but I'd go for the tres leches. They also have whole cakes that are reasonably priced. I tried their almond cookies (I think it was 5 for $1.50) and their butter cookies and they're what I expected and weren't too sweet. The extent of their pastry selection is just the Apple Turnover and it was just okay for $1.25. They have other stuff, too. They also serve ice cream. The women who work here are nice. I'd come back because I like to support local businesses and also because I enjoy their light and not-to-sweet desserts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5fHRx5_Zi6CJM0MFlOvH1g"}
