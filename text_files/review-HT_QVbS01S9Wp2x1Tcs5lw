Snarky receptionist... small rooms... Ground floor room to open to the public and the 2 parties (wedding was one) that went on in the court yard in front of our room. No movies in the room, just cable. Very good room service. Location is weird... 20 block walk to dancing/music area on 6th.", "business_id": "DAY7bx_a3mAtwb2yrlvyKg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-27", "type": "review"}
