The flavor is fantastic even while  the sauce, bread and cheese are so light and understated.  You know how you leave a restaurant and the taste of the food lingers for hours afterward? Doesn't happen here. You have a full sensation in your gut but no after taste in your mouth  - I'm talking about fresh ingredients!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ"}
