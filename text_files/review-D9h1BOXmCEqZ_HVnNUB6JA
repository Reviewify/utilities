Each time I was disappointed by the service, prices, and food. I got sandwiches both times, so I can say nothing of their bakery that people seem to think highly of. During my most recent visit, I waited 15 minutes for only an egg sandwich with ham and cheese just to be told that they were out of ham and \"would bacon be okay?\" I waited another 5 minutes for my sandwich. While waiting, I watched the order window where a young man with long hair, probably a cook, stuck his head out the window to tell someone something, allowing his hair to drag in someone's salad. He didn't notice, neither did she. Ew. Also, there was a hair in my sandwich. Had there not been, I would have still been disappointed by the relatively bland and small amount of food I got for the price I paid. I wasn't the only one waiting this long, either. I won't be going here again.", "business_id": "e3JYTYbYQlLTpzRhtkZr2A", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-04-11", "type": "review"}
