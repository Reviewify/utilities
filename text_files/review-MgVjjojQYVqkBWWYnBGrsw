I'm a supporter of Bobby Flay, so I wanted to give his burger palace a try and I wasn't disappointed. Keep in mind though, Bobby Flay is not the one on the grill. The burger was great. The fries were great. The dipping sauce for the fries was tasty. They have several different types of ketchup(sauces) to put on your burger, but I didn't need to use any of them. The Bobby Blue Burger was just right as is.  The only negatives were the server never brought my lemonade. After 10 minutes,I had to go up to the counter and ask for it. Secondly, for a burger joint, I thought it was a little pricey. $23 for 2 burgers fries and a drink. For the record, I'd pay it again.", "business_id": "csS_UrBujOvjASbX3gLW7w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-30", "type": "review"}
