You get a breeze off the water, you get to sit in the sun, and everyone is having a good time.\n\n--$2 Gansett and reasonably-priced everything else.\n\n--Free Popcorn\n\n--Laid back beachy vibe\n\n--Vegetarians can order a grilled zucchini and it actually tastes good\n\n--Friendly staff, and owners who actually seem to appreciate keeping their customers happy.  A while ago, I inquired on Hot Club's facebook page what time their trivia started.  I was told 8 o'clock.  I showed up at 8 with three friends only to find that it didn't start til 9:30.  Since we all had to work early the next day, and the game went on til almost midnight, we were a little annoyed.  I mentioned again on the facebook page that I was really disappointed, got a sincere apology from the owner AND a GC for $20.  I would have been content with just the apology.\n\nOnly complaint: when the deck is full or too cold and we sit inside, the music is always blasting far, far too loud. This is a great place to chill out and have a conversation--turn it down!!  I'll still think you're cool!", "type": "review", "business_id": "oMy_UrvOsjcRw0rb3pGAtg"}
