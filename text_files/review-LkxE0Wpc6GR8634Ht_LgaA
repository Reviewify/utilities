There are only a handful of restaurants in Ann Arbor that have the space, ambiance, and food quality where you can host a a fun but semi-professional event without having to rent the entire restaurant, and I've happily found that Raven's Club is one of them. We had the entire back of the restaurant, which has a nice mix of seating, from cushy booths to tables that can be configured in many ways. The manager Ashley was amazingly accommodating throughout the process, from agreeing to host a party of 45 within a week's notice--and during restaurant week no less!--and adjusting the menu to fit our budget. We were able to do appetizers, a 3-course meal, and drinks, including one of their fun cocktails, at a very reasonable price. I even stopped by the Saturday before to discuss all the details. We had two dedicated servers who were friendly and professional throughout the evening. Most importantly, the food was delicious. Everyone at my table enjoyed the stuffed chicken breast with root vegetables and kale--enough to order another plate when we saw that we had a little money left in the budget! The lavender infused creme caramel was a hit; others enjoyed the chocolate mouse, but I guess I'm partial to all things flan-related. For the sake of credibility, I'll say I wasn't a huge fan of the bruschetta--could use a lighter touch. That small point aside, everyone in the party had a great time; several said they'd come back on their own. I would certainly recommend Raven's Club for regular dining and especially for a group event. I'll certainly be back to try another one of their cocktails and something new from the kitchen!", "business_id": "93afWhCcHLuJsC4Jf4sQPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-21", "type": "review"}
