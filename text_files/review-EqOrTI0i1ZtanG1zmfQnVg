Anyways, there was no one in the restaurant (surprise surprise) and the hostess/waitress let us sit wherever we wanted. Korean music was blaring and ESPN sports center was on the huge TV behind the sushi bar....but whatevs, I was there to eat. We ordered the Philadelphia roll ($7.50), spider roll ($7.95) and pork katsu bowl ($7.95). The sushi was surprisingly good and pretty cheap. I didn't really like the pork katsu bowl (check out Hayato if you want good ton katsu don). Compared to Hayato, King Kong has a wider selection (including bulgogi and kalbi lol) and the prices are a little cheaper. But I think Hayato has better quality food. I also like the huge, laminated menus they have at King Kong, the pictures kind of help with making a decision about what to get from the huge selection.", "business_id": "RlSnnS3SkjVumfu7kzPLCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-06", "type": "review"}
