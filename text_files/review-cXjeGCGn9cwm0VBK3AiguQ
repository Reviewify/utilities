I don't log a lot of miles on my shoes, but I was desperately in need of a new pair. The knowledgeable salesperson set me up with a set of entry-level kicks and encouraged me to walk around in them and try them out on the treadmill. He brought out four almost identical pairs from different brands to ensure the best possible fit. Everything went perfectly smoothly, and I would definitely come here again for my next pair.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JK6a5IRnPg1tQA3FruwaQw"}
