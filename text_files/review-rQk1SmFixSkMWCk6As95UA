While being incredibly professional, they are so fun and make sure you're extremely comfortable. While I have yet to do a shoot with them, they've done a lot of work with my friends and i've seen quite a few examples of their work. Every time I see a new batch of pictures, I'm more impressed with how their work turns out. If I ever get married, Day 7 will definitely be one of my top options! (does that get me a discount??)", "business_id": "cj8USkLRiQmS_p62r3v4KA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-19", "type": "review"}
