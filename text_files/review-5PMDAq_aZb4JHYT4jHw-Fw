I am not sure about your taste buds but this is truly the best ice cream around. The burnt caramel has been my favorite since I was six years old (yes I am a Cambridge lifer). I have tried some of the newer flavors (B3, bourbon gingersnap, salty caramel) and each one has been an ice cream masterpiece. Also If you want to make someone's birthday, try the ice cream cakes. I got the Vienna finger version last summer and it was amazing.", "business_id": "u1Xq93R4LQ2VV2hK8MK5Wg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-10", "type": "review"}
