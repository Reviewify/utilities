The staff is really nice, helpful and friendly! My surgery went well and was fast.  I have already been back an additional time, since my kiddo poked me in the eye already, OUCH! However, Dr. Hamilton fixed me right up in no time at all. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants quality, precise, cutting edge eye care.", "business_id": "kuwKLz24FPpwiyoJKc7fYg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-27", "type": "review"}
