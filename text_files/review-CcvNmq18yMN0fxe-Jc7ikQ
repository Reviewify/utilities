Wouldn't call any aspect of the experience 'spectacular' but would definitely recommend this spot if you feel like eating Italian in a relaxed, uncrowded environment. Service was great. \n\nIf you want to eat spectacular Italian in this area, pisticci's is definitely the best (although you will probably have to wait 20-30 minutes to get a table and they don't take reservations).", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w"}
