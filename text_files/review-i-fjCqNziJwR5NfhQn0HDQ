Apparently the vegetation-filled back area connects to a UNC-affiliated trail; I would've looked for it were it not nighttime. \n\nWe both ordered soy chai lattes, which were delicious without sweetener. However, the baristas were standoffish and unappreciative of our business, oozing too-cool vibes. I don't know why, since they pour coffee for a living. \n\nDespite the unwelcoming attitudes, we found a table out front, where a Latin band played songs like \"Chan Chan\" and Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Wagon Wheel.\"\n\nCaff\u00e9 Driade's whimsical setting compensates for the huffy staff, I suppose.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6au_opmlfDOzN6sE_ugmHA"}
