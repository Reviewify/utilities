The patio is the perfect place to dine in good weather (and the red chairs are comfortable).  I usually stick to the specials menu but on this last visit I tried the pastrami sandwich and duck confit crepes. They were both great and I have been craving the pastrami sandwich ever since.", "business_id": "A6p0E-nFupEjDKpKx45CIQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-07", "type": "review"}
