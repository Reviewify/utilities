My friend and I decided to stop in on a Sunday evening to have a couple of cheap beers (PBR was on special) and hang out for a little while. When we walked in, the place was empty. There were about 3 or 4 people in a group outside, but they were the only other people there. No problem, I thought, just a Sunday night and everyone's getting ready for a busy week. We weren't really looking for a party scene anyway, so we bellied up and ordered a couple of beers. We took the beers outside, where I took my first sip of PBR... You know that PBR sign that you've seen at many a bar that says \"What'll you have? COLD BEER\"? Well, apparently I forgot to mention that, because mine was warm. Not cool, not slightly chilled, but WARM. I was extremely annoyed and my friend went back to the bar to ask about the warm beer. The bartender told him the refrigeration system was busted - apparently he didn't feel that was necessary information BEFORE he served us warm beer. No offer to take the beer back, nothing. As I really wasn't in the mood to argue over something like that (and the beer was really cheap), I simply left the beer, walked down the street to OCSC, and had a wonderful time.", "business_id": "fls_PaY91L-AKVnoanfOAg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-11-25", "type": "review"}
