We started going here a few months ago, and it's a great place. Some of these reviews are old, so let me start by saying, Zog's is under new ownership, and Mandy has made a lot of great improvements. They have a great drink selection, and great beer choices. We love the free pool on Sundays, along with the movie night. James(Mandy's brother) picks a lot of fun movies and with drinks you get free popcorn, cajun style :D I love the chupacabra(spicy bloody mary) and the white nihilist(white russian, but BETTER!) I also like the apple drink on their specialty drink menu. The drinks have amusing names :D If you haven't been in awhile, I recommend trying out the place again. You will enjoy the improvements.", "business_id": "0AuFYe6Ia-FQ1vXwS5gshQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-27", "type": "review"}
