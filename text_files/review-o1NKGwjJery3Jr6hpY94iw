Really good. In fact, I can think of only a few that are better. The nachos are also top notch. Too bad the service borders on hostile. It was bad. When I had the audacity to try to order, the guy just walked away. When he finally got back, he just stared at me til I ordered. If I got it wrong, would he hit me? Declare a blood feud? \nInstead, he grunted 'nine', took my cash, and walked away. A real treat, that one. \n\nMinutes later, the food came. It was wrong. When I corrected him, he said nothing and walked away. \n\nHe eventually returned, dropping off the rest of the order, then left. \n\nDelicious tacos, but me not feeling threatened is kinda important when I'm ordering food. There was probably a language barrier there. But you know what? I don't care. He could have at least smiled.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PfbyinPLMGAfSrYGia5Jvg"}
