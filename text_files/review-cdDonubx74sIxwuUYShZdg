Also, one of my favorites. Reminds me of good old homecooking. Nothing posh or fancy just simple and delicious. The owners are wonderful and they cook up a storm.\n\nI always order their kalbi ribs or their mini loco moco meal. Worth the stop in!", "type": "review", "business_id": "cvDsVQAPUd3-9MgzskbN8g"}
