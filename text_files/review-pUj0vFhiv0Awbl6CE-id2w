Kitchenette is nothing if not adorable - the pink decor, tables made out of reconstructed doors, and recycled jars used as glasses are all very charming.  The food is hearty and made with high quality ingredients.   My standard brunch is the Lumberjack - 2 scrambled eggs, whole wheat pancakes, and sausage (although I ask them to replace the sausage with cheese on the eggs).  The portions are huge!  One pancake is the equivalent of 2-3 pancakes anywhere else.  They are very thick, and complimented nicely by the strawberry butter they give you.  The hot chocolate is also delicious, and served in a very large mug.  I can also recommend any of the beautiful desserts you will see to your right as you walk in. What's not so adorable is the wait.  On a typical weekend morning during the school year, you might wait 30-45 minutes for a table at brunch.  Since there's not a lot of space inside to wait, you're generally being pushed around by more people coming in to put their names on the list.  I suppose that's to be expected for a place with good food, but it's definitely annoying.  I've also had mixed experiences with the staff, but overall everyone's pretty friendly. I'm not so crazy about the lunch & dinner menus, as they're not particularly vegetarian-friendly, but the brunch and desserts are terrific.", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-23", "type": "review"}
