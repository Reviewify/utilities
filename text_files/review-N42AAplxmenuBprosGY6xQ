The hot cakes are what brought me back. The first time, I got the strawberry ones. Fresh, cold strawberries smothered with brown sugar and freshly made whipped cream wrapped in a buttery, fluffy, and slightly salty hot cake. So. Freaking. Good. Round 2: Fresh bananas smothered in chocolate and wrapped in a buttery, fluffy, and slightly salty hot cake. So. Freaking. Good. It was a bit hectic going in the morning -- they have an early bird special which has really good deals until like 8am or something. But the second time I went, I went at around 2pm and it was super empty. The service at 2pm was good though -- super friendly people. Highly recommended!", "business_id": "YO8sWa0wYChH6DQWnE6NFg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-27", "type": "review"}
