There's fancy music, fancy floor, fancy prices and even some fancy nuts and chocolates and salts and dried veggies.\n\nThat's pretty much where it's then like a selectively stocked Harris Teeter with higher prices. \n\nWhat it does have going for it is just a few more things than a generic grocery like bulk nuts and such. But it's no Whole Foods or A Southern Season. \n\nI just wish more people would shop there so it would be more \"fresh.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "-GAzHziC8HAbjpJxLoir1w"}
