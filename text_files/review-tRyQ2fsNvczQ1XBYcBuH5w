It's good to come here for specific things, but it seems inconvenient for every day shopping. I was looking to restock on breakfast fixins and they didn't have packaged ham and cheese. I instead got cheese and ham sliced fresh, which is usually good, but it was sliced way too thin, and due to its freshly sliced nature the slices aren't separated by pieces of paper. Not only that, they only had Tropicana OJ and Simply Orange (which isn't simply orange, to me...)\n\nSeems counterintuitive to pursue a packaged product in favor of a fresh product, but in this case it makes a lot of sense for my situation, IMHO.\n\nThe produce didn't look that amazing either. It seems that maybe you want to come here for their deli, oils, sauces, etc. It is not a great general purpose grocery store and maybe they should refocus their offerings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MF8l_0vWjjNgv5dOuf3w0g"}
