He seems to like it so far...I was a little surprised that parents are sent away for the duration of class, but hey, I get to read for 45 minutes or grab a coffee.  So my reportage of what goes on in class may be limited to my 4-year old's reports--i.e. \"I danced and danced and then danced twenty times!\"  But his teacher seems very friendly.  Parking around here stinks, though.  I make sure to have enough quarters to get an hour-only spot, as they are all I can find.\n\nEDIT, 7/26/07_______________________________\n\nOk guys, you need to put up a sign on the brick paved driveway-like area out front that tells people in no uncertain words not to park there.  We have been happily attending classes for weeks now, and every time I go, I see cars parked right out front.  So, after seeing the grandmother of two of my son's classmates park there, I decided to pull up next to her.  When I get out of class 45 minutes later some guys from B&B's towing are jimmying open this grandmother's car and hoisting it up onto the tow truck.  Unbelievable.  You administrative staff at the school should just tell the waiting parents/guardians about an imminent towing of any cars parked out front before simply making a call and hugely inconveniencing the people who pay good money to send their kids/grandkids/whoever to lessons there.  Or just, I REITERATE, put up a sign, and save everyone some trouble!  The tow-truck guys would not detach themselves from this poor lady's car unless she gave them 75 dollars in cash, on the spot.  This is just awful and simply extortionary.  I had to go to an ATM to get these guys to unhook from her car (she was short on cash) and allow her drive her crying twin grandkids home from class.  How shitty of you guys, both B&B towing and Jose Mateo.  Get some tape, put up a sign, and apologize.  Now.  Mean, mean, mean.  Bad karma for you.
