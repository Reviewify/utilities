Everywhere was packed, so we ducked into this small place because there seemed to be room. There is some bar-like seating on the bottom floor and six or so tables in a loft upstairs.  We ordered a single cheeseburger and a pulled pork sandwich with the idea of splitting both. We got onion rings on the side. The food was ready pretty quickly. Very self-serve type of place.  The pulled pork (after college in NC, I'm spoiled on Carolina BBQ which is vinegar based and I haven't found anything like it outside of central NC) was sort of tasteless but on the sweeter side rather than the spicy side and the slaw which was on top of the pork (where it should be) was watery. The single cheeseburger had a somewhat sugary tasting bun, similar to the pulled pork, but I noticed it more on the savory cheeseburger. The cheese wasn't present as an active taste just too diffuse. The burger was just eh, but greasy. Maybe I could've used ketchup? Didn't find the house sauce compelling.  Onion rings were good to me, but Ross thought they were a little salty.  I don't think I'll go back!", "business_id": "_gMudADHrACVPC9rnnmuzg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-10-24", "type": "review"}
