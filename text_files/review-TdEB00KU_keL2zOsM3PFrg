The waitress was super nice, I told her I had no idea what to order, but that I wanted something \"with lots of veggies + no garlic\" (to spare the hubby having to smell it on my all week) she immediately recommended the Cashew Delight. Hubby said he wanted a spicy soup - she recommended Tom Yum - it was delicious. Loads of mushrooms, tofu, onion. & The Cashew Delight? FABULOUS! A little heavy on the oily-ness, but the veggies were cooked just right (not too long, but nice + tender) and the tofu was AMAZING! I fell in love. Food: Fantastico, but greasy-ish. C'mon, chill out with my veggies, don't drown 'em! Service: friendly, happy to help when you don't know what to order Price: very reasonable, not too pricey + not dirt cheap Decor: buddha buddha (Can we tell people about Jesus in that place? We should have) Return? nah, we prefer Cafe Flora and their wholesome, less \"yo I'm all covered in oil\" eats. But hey, maybe Araya's had some bomb salads I missed out on. Who knows. :) PS: Cashew Delight could've easily been split between 2 people, as the soup, and my hubby's thai fried rice.
