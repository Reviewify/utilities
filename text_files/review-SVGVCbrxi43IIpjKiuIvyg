The prices are very, very reasonable (cheap), the food is usually pretty good.  Tuesdays are my favorite, goulash is the special of the day.  Their egg salad is pretty good as well as their breakfast foods.  Portions are very generous as well. The staff is pretty good there and some have quite a sense of humor. I had hot chocolate one winter day and after \"drinking\" all the whipped cream I asked the waitress for more whipped cream.  Next time she walked by she dropped off the can of whipped cream and said \"Go nuts\" without breaking stride. Overall, I'd recommend checking it out if you're hungry, want a good amount of decent food but don't want to spend too much.", "business_id": "n9KSfii0GCOJOhDJLAXJ7Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-27", "type": "review"}
