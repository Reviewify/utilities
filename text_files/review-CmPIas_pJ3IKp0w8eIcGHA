Ed's Sauce - hot being especially good - although it usually wasn't hot enough, but if you ask them, they'll mix it with the regular hot sauce to make it a bit spicier.  I probably ordered from there 9/10 Sundays during football season.  The pizza was pretty good, too.  I can't really say about the rest of the menu, because I haven't had it. The downside to Ed's is that the delivery speed is VERY slow.  I lived a few blocks away and it could take over an hour, even at non-peak times.", "business_id": "lXVJLzBNEd5qWuoX1d1okQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-16", "type": "review"}
