They have great specials the 7.99 rolls and the hip hop and r&b music. I mean what can go wrong? I love the staff, one time the staff gave us free edamame as an appetizer and green tea ice cream as a dessert. If you had bad service before come back again maybe it was your bad day, because this place really rocks!", "type": "review", "business_id": "NgwqZNamI-NyBMfiIadWCA"}
