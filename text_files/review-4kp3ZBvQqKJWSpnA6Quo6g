Some are absolutely delicious and some are really bland. I recommend ordering off the Brazilian side of the menu, not the Tex Mex. The Brazillian Paella is delicious. All the portions are huge so considering you get two meals out of it I think this place is a deal! Also, check out the gluten-free menu - you get lots of options! Also, the happy hour is a great deal and the margaritas delicious.", "business_id": "4_Z2QGkLj5QICAaSv94gnQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-14", "type": "review"}
