They serve up some good Mexican food! The fajita burritos are really tasty and I love their rice, beans, and salsa. However, Lulu's is overpriced (what can you expect, it's Palo Alto!). I used to go here all the time when I worked at Jamba Juice in Town & Country and I got to know some of the employees. Almost all of them were extremely nice and hard working so I'm surprised to see so many negative comments about service on here! I had the lunchtime hook-up because I got them to give me one order of 1/2 rice, 1/2 beans for the price of one side! They also have Jarritos here (which is always good) and they give free soda refills. Unfortunately, they charge for chips, which I find extremely irritating. No indoor seating, but plenty of outdoor seating (both covered and uncovered). You definitely have to try this place!", "business_id": "tJcGrLXB0zViCoEiYgcs1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-16", "type": "review"}
