In general at Pitt, all the students would go here for half off food since it was cheap ok indian food.\n\nSlowly they cut their hours back and closed earlier and earlier. They got rid of their tv's with the music videos and have made sure to higher even ruder, slower waiters. (aka as it was said before they have no clue what a water pitcher is...) Everything u read about the bad reviews is so true (rushing customers, not putting in right orders, skimping on the rice and then charging u extra for a lil more, and blank angry stares)\n\nOn my most recent experience, I did not even get to eat. I made sure to find out their hours and rushed over after work getting there a half hour before they closed at 10. I barely walked thru the door when they exclaimed they were closed. I then asked if I could get carryout and they said no. What is the point of having hours of business (that keep getting smaller) when you are not going to keep them?\n\n*on a side note my friend was actually already eating in there, and she said that after I left some people came in and ordered take out* \n\nDidn't think it was true, but guess only their fellow Indian friend's get the good service...", "type": "review", "business_id": "PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q"}
