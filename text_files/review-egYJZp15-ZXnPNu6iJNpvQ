Until yesterday, I really loved the flavor and variety of the food. Until yesterday, I truly enjoyed the cuteness of the staff, and didn't mind the slightly slow service where you're expected to order everything (drinks and food) all at once. Until yesterday, I had never, in my life, gotten a cockroach in my food. My friends and people who know my well, know that I go well beyond the normal dislike of cockroaches.  I see one on the sidewalk and I will freak out.  To find one in the soup that I have already consumed half of, and I started crying.  I threw up and didn't stop crying for a full half an hour.  I was nauseous for the entire day. We did call the health department.", "business_id": "P_7A5Ztw4Pwizpdqfx-G-Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-03-12", "type": "review"}
