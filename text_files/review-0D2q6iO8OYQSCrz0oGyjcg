They have such a huge selection that I was completely overwhelmed the first time I went there. But now I'm addicted and make a monthly run for my titles. Staff is very friendly; they greet you when you come in the door. Again there's a huge selection, though I buy single issues there instead of TPB since you can get those cheaper online. Plus, on Free Comic Book Day they let you take 7 comics, more than what I've seen other comic book stores allow. Their parking in the back is weird and really hard to get out of. So...park on the street or secretly park in the McDonald's lot next door.", "business_id": "rKuwoSiXmbpVTHRkgYfn2Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-12", "type": "review"}
