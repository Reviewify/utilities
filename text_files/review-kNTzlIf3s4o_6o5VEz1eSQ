I had the lamb burger, served with cucumber relish, mint sauce, and a side of Afghan fries (potato wedges with a beer batter type crust). It was really good, but definitely needed some fat (mayo or greek yogurt) because the lamb was so lean. The price seem high, until I saw the size of the ground lamb patty. Definitely worth the price. I like that their dinner menu said right in the front \"Lunch items can be made upon request.\" I don't know why more restaurants don't do that. The waiter was nice, if a little relaxed. But, I never felt ignored. There were so many things that looked good on the menu. I'm looking forward to our next trip to Claremont so I can try a couple of other things. There's a \"Taste of India: Pasta\" that really sounded good. It was a too early for cocktails. But, they have a great looking full bar. Always a plus in my book.", "business_id": "ja-xH_xUKBFawH7ZQEeCsw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-21", "type": "review"}
