(they cut 20% off my bill.) you are accosted with a blast attack of kiss 108 music as soon as you enter, which is a huge turn off in my book. i do not want to hear call me maybe and advertisements blaring out of the ceiling while i eat. there are two bars (one with flat screened tvs) and assorted seating areas. a big bowl of candy sits at the hostess stand. service was distracted and aloof. no one asked me how my meal was or came over to check on my water. i had to wait for ten minutes after finishing for my waitress to show up. i was so eager to pay the bill that i had my cash in hand and was tapping my toe to lady gaga.. when my change arrived, i dropped a couple of coins, so i was able to get a close up view of the floor which was not so pretty. i paid about $10 and that was the best part of the meal. that and the ice water. it's hard to write reviews like this. sorry about reporting in with disappointing sushi news out of central square, but we will not be back.", "business_id": "PEv6gtuj01IMkVS_1hiCuw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-12", "type": "review"}
