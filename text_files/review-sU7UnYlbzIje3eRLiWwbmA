I would have to disagree. The food is consistently good. Their fried rice is amazing and their curries. Now you should know Im a curry fiend. I would die if I didn't get my weekly Thai fix. I generally just cook my own b/c homemade is always superior, but when i go out this is my top pick. Their curries are all good, but would be considered \"american spicy.\" they have kick, but by no means are spicy. My favorite part about this place has little to do with the food though. The staff plays along when I'm there with my crazy guy friends who've been drinking. They'll crack jokes with us rather than just getting upset at our noise level. Great atmosphere for an outing with friends, and one of the waiters there will tell you what you're ordering before the words come out of your mouth. That guy just makes me happy.", "business_id": "DreD6wAqGxb9EHRmRhVG8w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-18", "type": "review"}
