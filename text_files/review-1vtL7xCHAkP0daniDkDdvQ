I went with some friends to the restaurant base on the yelp review.\n\nFood: I ordered the chicken biryaki. It came with rice, chicken, onions, and some seasoning. The taste was pretty good with the seasoning and the rice. Though I got to say the onion had a strong taste if you're eating it plain. It probably would be better mixed in with the food. The meal also came with a soup (potato soup I believe), and that had a good taste to it.\n\nEnvironment: The restaurant itself was somewhat small, and the environment was not bad. I wouldn't say it is complete authentic, but is about what I would expect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M8P96GmGImU0KOrFMfVCKw"}
