They combine friendly, relaxed service with excellent, creative food and phenomenal beers. Generally speaking their rotating specials are better than their standard line-up, but this is not surprising: those are the fun ones to come up with, after all. Their sweeter, boozier Belgian-style beers are particularly scrumptious, but they have been doing a great job of getting me to branch out into other genres. The Red God IPA is particularly worthwhile, for example, and the release of their seasonal barleywine has long been an annual event for me. Also, they occasionally do Brewer's Dinners that are particularly noteworthy: they will serve locally grown vegetables and humanely raised meats in creative preparations and match these with a stock of limited-run beers. When you see that one of these is happening, you should definitely take advantage of it.", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-24", "type": "review"}
