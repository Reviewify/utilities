The 'OPEN' sign was on and clearly blinking 'OPEN'. They appeared to be slow but had several tables with guests in the dining room and two tables of guests at the grill.  \n\nWe asked to be seated at the grill.  We were refused service and told they were getting ready to close.  I cannot image turning away business in a poor economy.  We generally spend at lest $50.00 a person there..which I think is significant for the Champaign-Urbana market. \n\nThe hostess repeatedly said, we cannot serve you because the staff would have to wait on you to finish your meal. I will never go back.  If they had been completely empty I would have had a better understanding of their position. And if they stop serving at a specific time before they close, perhaps they should turn off the 'OPEN' sign.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l1Pr4SbYrmf-8Gi8e2WRIg"}
