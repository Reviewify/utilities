A few bucks in exchange for caffeine and sugar to keep me going during midterms and finals.  Atmosphere: light classical/jazz music is always in the background. I don't mind hearing the buzz of conversation in the background as I do light reading. If I need to pound out a research paper, that's when ear plugs come in handy. Around lunchtime or afternoon is when the cafe is constantly buzzing with people. I love the abundance of seating and tables and if you grab a seat by the windows you can usually score an outlet. It is also handy for them to provide heat lamps outside when the weather gets chilly.  Downsides: unreliable internet, but you can usually log into Bancroft Hotel's wireless since it's right next door. Airbears sometimes works here. There is also no bathroom here so you'd have to run across the street to campus or to Unit 1. This is a problem if you're not studying here with people b/c I would not trust a stranger to look after my laptop if I needed to step away.  GET: mocha, apple cloud, hot apple cider.", "business_id": "_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-12", "type": "review"}
