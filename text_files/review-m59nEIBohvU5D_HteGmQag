But I'm cheating on my boyfriend. I have a secret crush on this dude named JJ who makes these awesome sandwiches. I told my boyfriend that I was cheating on him with JJ. He couldn't believe his ears. He knows JJ and actually dislikes him. He then told me he was having an affair with someone too. He's been seeing my best friend, Ms. T Cloud. I couldn't believe that I've been betrayed!! So, for the past few weeks I've sworn to my boyfriend that I wouldn't go see JJ. I lied. I love the sandwiches. They are the yummiest sandies in town. My faves are the Vito and the slim 6. They remind me of the sandwiches that my uncle would make. JJ, I like you a lot. You're the fastest sandwich maker in the world. You'll even do a drive by and deliver my sandwich to my office. But, I will have to dump you in order to keep my relationship with my boyfriend. Psst... See you next week.. same time, maybe different location so I don't get caught!", "business_id": "dqux3WWVy2Gtyr3UwHL1wQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-02", "type": "review"}
