Not okay. Finally, after a month on campus, I decided to pay a visit to The Coffee Bar in Stamp Student Union on the way back from class.\n\n...Correction: two visits. Within 3 hours. \n\nFirst visit: Iced Caramel Macchiato - as good as I remember it from Starbucks. \n\nSecond visit: Sweetened Iced Black Tea - yummm! And healthy :) I think. Does the syrup make it unhealthy? :(\n\nService is fairly fast and you can use your TerpBucks! It's the next best thing to having an actual Starbucks on campus in an accessible location. There's ample seating space both inside and outside, and they sell pastries too. \n\nGrande size only, limited selection of drinks (obviously).", "type": "review", "business_id": "cNq0UgS7biGPSx39cxWd-Q"}
