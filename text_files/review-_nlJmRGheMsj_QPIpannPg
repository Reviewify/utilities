We made reservations, as recommended, and went for a Friday evening dinner. The place is small and inviting with indoor and romantic outdoor seating with a lovely water fountain and candles. Noire Food and Wine is conveniently located right next to the Pasadena Ice House, which I'm sure helps business and would make it an ideal spot for pre-comedy date night.. They have an extensive wine bar, which is no surprise because wine is in the title, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the menu is based on seasonal availability. I ordered sea bass and the Bf ordered steak we both decided that we would enjoy a side of shishito peppers, all of which were delectable. The portions for the meat were not large but satisfying and filling. The drawback was not in the flavor but in the timing. We ordered our peppers at the same time as the meal however they did not come until much later, once we were practically done with our plates. Other then that the other bummer was no free parking. The lot across the street charges $5 after a certain time but paid parking is what is to be expected in Pasadena. In conclusion our experience was very pleasant and I would recommend it to anyone with a sophisticated pallet.", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-27", "type": "review"}
