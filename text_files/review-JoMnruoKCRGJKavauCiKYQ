I loved that the windows opened, and that the shuttered view was immensely green and lush -- and that my room was filled with the sound of the fountain (and some freeway noise, which I don't mind). I slept like a baby. The bed was super comfy and the desk in the room was a good workspace. \n\nThe hotel is within walking distance of your standard SoCal strip mall -- Whole Foods, Jamba Juice, Beauty Supply, etc. -- and includes room-key access through a shortcut if you don't want to walk the hill. \n\nHad the same oddities that others experienced -- sticky remote control for the tv, super tight bathroom. Not a big deal. I was a little surprised at the towels though. Face towels and bath towels might as well have been bath matts. Ow. \n\nNevertheless, staff is friendly, rooms are clean and include fridge, microwave, and Starbucks singles, and everything was comfy. I'd stay here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EevD53rg1YVe9TwWqHihHA"}
