GENIUS CONCEPT. I'm kicking myself thinking, \"why the heck didn't I think of that?!\".\n\nParking is a pain. Apparently there is a parking structure (after 6PM) near the place that is $3 of $6..don't remember. I got lucky and found street parking $1.75 for 2 hours.\n\nIt's first come, first serve, and self seating. You basically get in line, tell them what you want and what toppings you want, then pay. Then you find a seat.\n\nGot the burrata plate, 2 pizzas, and a caesar salad for 3 people. The food is good, fresh, and the toppings are high class. It's lower end compared to Pizzera Mozza (but amazing because the ingredients are only $1 each), and is more like the place in DTLA everyone goes to...the name escapes me at the moment...the one that sells macarons and takes forever to get a seat.\n\nI am definitely a fan of this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw"}
