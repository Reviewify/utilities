The other day, while we were at 4th St in Berkekey, I saw a big line leading to a food truck. Right away I had a feeling it was Cupkates because I saw a lot of people walking around with little boxes and I saw many little kids asking their parents for money for some treats. And what a treat it was, these were some of the best cupcakes around the East Bay. Although the line was long, I had to try these bad boys. So my two boys got the double vanilla, while my wife, daughter, and I got the red velvet (I wanted the salted caramel, but they quickly ran out, must be in high demand). They were absolutely delicious. The cream on top was rich and creamy, not over the top sweet like most cupcakes. I really like the red velvet, but I can go without the double vanilla. It was just too . . . . too vanilla for me!", "business_id": "zqvFNZq8q86V7QOcpURcSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-18", "type": "review"}
