These guys are understaffed and the whole place has a generally disorganized feel to it. There was only one person working on shipping things and the average wait seems to be between 20-30 minutes before getting helped. This also meant there was no one to ask questions about shipping options without interrupting another customer. The two staff I interacted with directly were very friendly (shift change while I was shipping my stuff). And there isn't another option for printing and shipping as convenient as this. So there it is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Qcxfy7UPBlofyv_DnE4AGQ"}
