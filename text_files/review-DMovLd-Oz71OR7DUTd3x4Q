Pizza tastes great, thickness is perfect. I think the best part is the variety they have on the menu. In particular, the create your own salad option is amazing. So many choices and you get a huge custom salad (can easily be shared between 4 people). Wings were also very good as was the blue cheese dressing that came with it.\n\nWish there was free delivery instead of a charge, but it's only $1.75, so not too bad. Prices are very reasonable and quality is great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u-8sFq05DQ6PYCR5HiKZ2w"}
