However, I've done this on about 10 occasions, so I feel as though I can comment on this place. The buns are $2, and best heated in the microwave for 30 seconds. Nothing special, but I don't know where else you can get a BBQ bun in Ann Arbor. So if you're ever craving one, this is the place to go! The staff is always very nice. And it's a great place to read a book or study. I went yesterday and there was a group of senior citizens, one middle aged woman, and one hipster. So basically, it's a place for everyone!", "business_id": "AztY39QdGAkoKrLy9Di2yw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-24", "type": "review"}
