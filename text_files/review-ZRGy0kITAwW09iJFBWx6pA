Seriously, what do you want?  I mean hotel food is hotel food, just like hospital food is hospital food.  Dinner was ok even for a hotel restaurant.  \n\nWe had the truffled fries, caesar salad and 2 orders of the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and veggies and it was quite good, but a bit too much food (I'm only saying that because our room doesn't have a microwave to reheat the leftovers).\n\nThe pear and cranberry tart with whipped mascarpone cheese was underwhelming to say the least.  The \"tart\" (purposeful quotation marks) was not so much a tart as pears and cranberries in batter, baked then smothered in way too much mascarpone (which was very bitter and un-pallatable).  \n\nThe staff was attentive and polite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RaUWW06DPd7WJ3U5mtFZRQ"}
