Unfortunately, it lived up to my expectations. \nFirst of all, it looks like a dump, outside and in. Several tables were not yet cleared, and was frankly disgusting. Inside, there a whole lot of tables, though I can't think of how they would ever get even half of them filled at once. \nThere was one server, and while he generally did a good job (besides speaking almost inaudibly softly) he did forget who ordered what. Really? There were 3 of us, and only 2 other tables were filled.\nThe food was either bland or bad. My French Toast was edible, though the strawberries on top were definitely from a can. I even saw the waiter pouring my mother's cranberry juice from a can. I don't know why we left a tip.\nBottom line: If you're ever in Philly, skip this joint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J2fh7F5wZ9BwjfKbxqQWiw"}
