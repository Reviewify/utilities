I've been here quite a few times, and every time I get the crunchy roll. Okay, I guess I'm not the biggest risk taker, but when the portions are pretty filling and the taste is decent, why not?  I guess it helps that I usually come here with friends that take the check, but still..I like it! It's close to campus (UCSD) and the seating outdoors is good for a late lunch on a warm day. Service was always good for me...I guess I've been lucky? phew.", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-05", "type": "review"}
