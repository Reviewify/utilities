Okay, I guess I'm not the biggest risk taker, but when the portions are pretty filling and the taste is decent, why not? \n\nI guess it helps that I usually come here with friends that take the check, but still..I like it! It's close to campus (UCSD) and the seating outdoors is good for a late lunch on a warm day. Service was always good for me...I guess I've been lucky? phew.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SijUAKpEjanhVghyhr46XQ"}
