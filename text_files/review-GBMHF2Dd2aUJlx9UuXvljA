It was terrible. In the L. A. area you can go to Costco and get a hot dog or polish dog plus a soda for 1.65. And there is no comparison. I can name 10 to 15 places in the L. A. area that are very good. Franks is the worst hot dog I have ever had. I only gave them one star because it was clean and the waiter was polite", "type": "review", "business_id": "fLZdfz0-YXyV2yhLxocaaQ"}
