They have a wide variety of soups which are labeled vegan, vegetarian, low fat, spicy, and more. You also get a choice of bread with your soup. Be sure to try the chicken tortilla. They put cheese and tortilla strips on top of it. mmm mmm.\n\nI also LOVE their salads. They're huge and so good! I got the chipotle chicken salad and it was awesome and lasted me 2 days. Great value.", "type": "review", "business_id": "elt6nbq4fRcCn7Enk6e7Tw"}
