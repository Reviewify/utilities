I ordered the lamb kebob, which came with rice, salad, and naan.\n\nThe good: the naan was terrific: warm,soft and chewy.  \n\nThe bad: the lamb was of poor quality and cooked unevenly.  I should have known the kebob was bad when I had to saw for around 20 seconds with my plastic utensils to cut the meat.  When I popped the piece in my mouth, it was tough and grisly and I popped it back out.  I haven't done that in public since I was a kid.  Four other pieces were also tough.  One was just about raw.  The one good piece, which was cooked well done, was at least free of cartilage and fat.  The rice was bland and flavorless.  Even the juices from the meat couldn't give it any taste.\n\nThe saving grace was the naan and the grape soda (which seems to be a DC area thing). \n\nThe Greenbelt/College Park area seems loaded with small ethnic restaurants.  This one was a miss.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j4PVNCpxS_U9rw0yn-Tiwg"}
