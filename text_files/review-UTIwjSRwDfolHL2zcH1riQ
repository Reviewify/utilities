I have a contract for UNLIMITED NATIONWIDE LONG DISTANCE CALLING and yet I can't call San Diego, CA! Apparently there is something in the fine print which says that there are,indeed, places in the contiguous United States where I can't call.  The snippy Customer Service person said \"I would advise you to read your contract:\" You can bet I'll be signing on with someone else TOMORROW.  BUYERS BEWARE METROPCS  Oh.. If you phone Customer Service, when you get the voice asking questions, just keep shouting \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" and you will eventually connect to them. Just don't expect too much. You can pay by credit card, but they charge you an extra $3-$4.!!!!!", "business_id": "2VEml2_-LYFmzxIcxwy8Mw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}
