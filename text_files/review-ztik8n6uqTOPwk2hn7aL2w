Okay, a few. \n-It takes a long time to get your food so call ahead or just don't go in starving like I usually do. (I understand quality takes times but I'm sooo impatient.  waaaah!)\n-It's pretty pricey but once in awhile I think it's worth it. \n -The first couple times I was here, they served my food with Doritos. uh?\nThe last time it came with awful veggie stick chip things.  \nYuck.  If you're going to go the easy route, at least hit me with some stacy's pita chips.  \n\nIf you're into this sort of food, it's definitely worth a try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C1OLx5RjPgBM4j9q7sg12Q"}
