We were on vacation and they were close to each other so we thought, \"why not?\" I didn't love this place, I didn't hate it, but it definitely wasn't my favorite. When we walked in we were told that all mini's were $1. Yay. We got six so we could take a bite of each and decide what we liked. Well the guy behind that counter wasn't that friendly so we hurried and made out choices. When he boxed them they were already falling over and sticking to each other. We took them to the car and by that point they were a mess. The only reason I'm giving this place three stars is because the Vanilla Latte cupcake was really tasty and the cake part of the cupcakes I could piece together and try was baked really well. I might try them again if I go back for vacation, but then again, I could very easily forget about this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_4CuwHPcNkGgqVp8fbFNdQ"}
