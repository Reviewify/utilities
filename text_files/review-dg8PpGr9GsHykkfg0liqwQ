I've been a fan of this restaurant even back in Dallas (it's one of the few mass franchises I that I'd willingly patron).  It's AYCE salad bar is $7.59 and includes fresh-cut vegetables, select organics, homemade potato and pasta salads, gingerbread muffins, garlic toast.  For $7.59 that's cheaper than most pay-by-the-pound hot food & salad bars in downtown DC.  Personally, I always get an extra serving of the egg salad as well as the pasta salad.  Like Jeffrey D. said, \"no matter what you order, you get free soft-serve ice cream.\"  That's right, even if you got the cup of soup for $2.79 you can stuff yourself with complimentary muffins and soft serve.  And this is no ordinary soft-serve ... it's thick and creamy yet light and airy.  As far as salad bars, it's second only to the Sweet Tomato franchise (assuming you have the buy-one-get-one-free coupon).
