Furthermore, considering I adore Hungarian and virtually all central European treats, this place hit the motherload. \n\nPoints taken off, however, for bored, lazy service. \n\nI decided upon a napoleon, something which I think I might have had once in my life previously. It was $3.50, and made up almost entirely of a stiff, yellow and delicious custard. Sandwiching this delightful filling were two puff pastries covered in powdered sugar. Though they were tasty, I had to pick them up and bite into them, as a knife wouldn't suffice. Be sure to turn the pastries right side up when consuming, or else you'll be covered in a shower of baby powder.\n\nWhen I get another hankering, I'll venture back over here and give you guys a more thorough review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Qe6g3Dv5NXN1Zq-egJk9w"}
