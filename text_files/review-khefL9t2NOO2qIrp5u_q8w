This time I went for the \"Silk Road\" exhibit and it was mobbed. Unfortunately, the museum does not handle crowds easily and the layout, which incorporates multiple buildings leaves quite a bit to be desired. The exhibit and much of the museum were not particularly friendly for people with disabilities. A disagreement with China cut short the \"Silk Road\" exhibit which may explain why the museum (with timed tickets to control crowding) really permitted too many people for the size of the exhibition. The staff are friendly but a little clueless--e.g., they didn't know if there was a coat check (there is at the entrance for people w/o exhibit tickets). Men's rooms are rather difficult to find, but things are easier for women. Signposts are sometimes misleading.Some very good exhibits from the past seem to have gone into storage. The Asian collection includes a beautiful space, but seems much reduced from the past. Still, there is much worth seeing, particularly in the Egyptian artifacts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hnXA1m5_6ogFvuvPDEP0Aw"}
