It's awesome. When my friend suggested this place for dinner, I was hesitant -- it was usually just a \"let's go here before the movies\" kind of place. I can't overstate how much the menu has improved.  Whereas before I expected their trumped-up bar food, I now find a menu that is properly varied in it's offerings and locally-sourced in it's ingredients (but isn't all in your face and Cambridge-y about it).  In addition to nachos, fries, pizzas and burgers, there is a beer and cheese pairing, a cranberry maple glazed salmon, an Asian duck confit salad, and beer-braised lamb shank.  I had the Roasted half chicken, which was good, but I was jealous of my friend's roasted duck breast with pork belly, which was downright fabulous. I have always enjoyed the CBC's regular brews, but I was especially impressed with the specials we ordered.  The sour beer was a totally new experience for me.  I also had the Barleywine, which I loved.  The sampler beer order was a perfect choice, and I highly recommend it. Additionally, the wait staff was very, very pleasant.  We were there on a busy Saturday night.  We were accidentally served the wrong appetizer.  The waitress and manager both came over to immediately apologize, and gave us both the incorrect app and our correct app for free.  When dinner arrived, she apologized for it's tardiness -- frankly, we hadn't noticed.  When our bill came, several drinks and an entree were comped for our \"trouble,\" though we hadn't felt troubled at all.  The waitress was knowledgeable about the beers and about pairings.  Overall, I had an excellent, excellent night.", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-27", "type": "review"}
