Today I ate a tomato/basil pizza and a side of the tomato and asiago soup. What are the differences from then til now? \n\n1. The crust was perfectly crispy on the bottom and along the crust. Crispy in the outside and hot and doughy on the inside. \n2. Sauce was flavorful, not too salty for me. To me, it's overkill if the sauce is salty and then you have a salty cheese over top. \n3. The crust was definitely not doughy. Thin, but not razor thin. Right where you want it to be. \n4. They used toasted sesame seeds along the crust/outside of the pizza. I don't remember this before and I thought it was a really nice touch. Added a nice flavor. Of course, that may be an allergy issue for some. \n\nThe soup was just ever-so-slightly salty and had an awful lot of black pepper. It was noticably spicy/smokey. It was good, but not memorable. I  would probably stick to the pizza next time. \n\nThe had a very enticing feta/eggplant pizza that I will be trying next time I go back. \n\nOverall, the 2 things that stick out in my head as I remember the pizza are the crispiness of the crust and the sesame seeds. I will be going back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "U4eJae433Tto-UpRAzdojA"}
