(but that means you're dropping like $11 for a 2 egg omelette with a piece of cheese in it, and the side portions are miniature.) don't be surprised if brunch hits you you for at least $15. it's also hella small inside, so have fun brunching 6 inches away from a dude and his girlfriend whining about exams or being on some 'bro, i got majorly trashed last nite, bro.' the tables are rickety, too, which gives a cool down home element to it, but can also be kinda tricky if you're an elbow on the tables type of dude. lines will be a good 45 minutes on weekends...so...bring that coat in the winter. there's zero room to lounge inside while waiting for a table.", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-09-17", "type": "review"}
