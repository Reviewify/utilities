The food in this neighborhood kinda sucks in general, so by comparison it's rather good and sorta reasonably priced. \n(But that means you're dropping like $11 for a 2 egg omelette with a piece of cheese in it, and the side portions are miniature.) Don't be surprised if brunch hits you you for at least $15.\nIt's also hella small inside, so have fun brunching 6 inches away from a dude and his girlfriend whining about exams or being on some 'bro, I got majorly trashed last nite, bro.' The tables are rickety, too, which gives a cool down home element to it, but can also be kinda tricky if you're an elbow on the tables type of dude.\nLines will be a good 45 minutes on weekends...so...bring that coat in the winter. There's ZERO room to lounge inside while waiting for a table.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg"}
