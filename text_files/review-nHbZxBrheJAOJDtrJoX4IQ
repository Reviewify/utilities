Was in Ann Arbor with a group of friends and we were told to go to Blimpie burger. I got a triple with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle and american cheese, went traditional on it. It was F*cking awesome. I am smacking my lips typing this and I at here over a month a go. The onion rings are also great. This place is a must eat if you are in Ann Arbor.
