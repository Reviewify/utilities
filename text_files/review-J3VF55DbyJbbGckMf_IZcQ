I had a cup of tortilla soup and a chicken taco,. The taco was perfectly seasoned, and the soup was phenomenal. Drinks were not that great, but they were reasonably priced. My friend and I had playa martinis, and while they tasted great they were very weak. The service left a lot to be desired. It was over ten minutes before somebody came by to get my drink order, and our server had no personality. I also hate sitting with an empty drink waiting for somebody to notice, and I did a lot of that here. However, we were there a long time and did not feel rushed and as I said, the food was great. I will definitely be back.", "business_id": "jylGZBet5C2CwJ-X0odhsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-13", "type": "review"}
