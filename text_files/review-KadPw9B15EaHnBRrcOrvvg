Hell, I have a flapper tattooed on my back! But I just can't bring myself to give the Fox five.\n\nThe architecture is beautiful, the decorations are gloriously fabulous, Mighty Mo (the organ) is spectacular, and the event spaces are incredible. But the Fox has a flaw that I can't really get over: the acoustics.\n\nI've seen everything from Indiana Jones to the Marriage of Figaro here. I've seen musicals; I've seen Dolly Parton; I've seen Alison Krauss.\n\nI love the nostalgia and the history of the place, but it's big and echoey and sometimes it can be hard to hear. The rock shows, operas and musicals I've attended have come out okay. \n\nThe movies are tough, though. We went to see Raiders of the Lost Ark with a friend a couple of summers ago, were seated in the balcony, and we couldn't hear the dialogue. Luckily, we knew what was happening so we could follow along, but it was kind of lacking.\n\nYesterday, we went to see Ben-Hur on the big screen and everything was great--the organ music, the sing-a-long, the ambiance. But the sound was harsh. I'm not sure if it was too loud or there was too much treble, but everytime a character in the film raised a voice, it kind of hurt my ears.\n\nI can totally forgive this because the Fox is awesome. And also because I got in to see this movie for free, but I think it's important to be aware of, at least.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SxtcekmS_EvKhOXWNAA3Mw"}
