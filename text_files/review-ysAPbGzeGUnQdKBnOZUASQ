They had great food, awesome decor, and good service. My only qualm was that they put all my tempura (for my tempura udon noodle dish) directly into the broth before serving... so I couldn't pick and choose when/what I wanted to put in which items! That aside, would really try again. Good service, decent prices for student-style budget constraints, and convenient location next to my fave, the Record Exchange.", "business_id": "Svho0F2hk_LzqYxKEUB7AA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-10", "type": "review"}
