I wasn't even expecting much; I just wanted some hot chocolate and fell upon this place with some friends while we were spending a weekend in Boston. It seriously tastes like they took a giant dark chocolate bar from Godiva and melted it and served it to you. It's soooo rich and sooooooo good. When I got my cup I was disappointed because the cup was so small for $3 worth of hot chocolate. But then I realized why. I barely finished it because it was so thick. definitely worth it. And their pastries aren't bad either. :]", "business_id": "gctbL0lDIYIHM6yDn99V-g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-19", "type": "review"}
