Located right next to Capriccio, the parking is can be tricky if you get here too late in the morning.  But once inside, the place is huge, but cozy.  Prices are rock-bottom for the location and the coffee is always spot on!  They always have several flavors of coffee and each one is as good as the last one I tried!  Service is also fast and friendly. Really, what more can you ask for?", "business_id": "SebzGPx68D3cMaLcoHSfUA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-27", "type": "review"}
