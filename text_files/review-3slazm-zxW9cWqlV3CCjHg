They shut down Higuera street from about 6-9ish. I usually dont go to farmers for the fresh produce, but for the atmosphere and culture that it has to offer. Being a college town, you generally always see college students, but at farmers, that all changes. Families come out and you see people of all ages.  There's always a variety of vendors that sell goods. My favorites are McClintocks bbq, the almond people, and Cowboy Cookie. Be sure to get there early to find parking. Usually around 8, McClintocks is sold out or their lines are enormously long.", "business_id": "nW230zy-Tnp_DyamfXRg8g", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-04", "type": "review"}
