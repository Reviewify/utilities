You can blame it on my hometown, Portland, OR; it's either rainy or cloudy 10 months out of a year so you can imagine what an exhilarating experience shopping at the outdoor malls there would be. Anyhoo. I thought the Stanford Shopping Center was very nice and enjoyable even though today was kind of chilly. We didn't know it was an outdoor mall until we got there. \n\nThere were lots of big, pretty flowers everywhere. Plenty of outdoor seating if you feel like taking a break and enjoy a latte or something. Almost kind of classy. There's no \"food court\" here (I guess that would ruin the classiness) but they do have several cafes like o'famous Starbucks...wait, California Pizza Kitchen, Pinkberry...mm, yeah. There were lots of doggies. They seem to enjoy window shopping as much as their owners enjoy shopping at the SSC. \n\nOh, and ladies. They have a 3-floor Nordstrom here (in its separate building) that's almost entirely dedicated for women. ;) The gentlemen and kiddie sections are located on the first floor; though not as extensive, still have a good selection. Inside there's also a really nice and bustling cafe.\n\nThere's a market here, too. White corn 4 for $0.99. *thumbs up* And there's a meat shop next to it. Interesting, huh? \n\nThere wasn't a whole lot of people, none of that mall rustling bustling, when we went. Too early? The parking lot was very full though but we didn't have trouble finding parking at all. \n\nMm. Nice mall. \"Too baller for me to buy anything.\" (quote Daniel H.)
