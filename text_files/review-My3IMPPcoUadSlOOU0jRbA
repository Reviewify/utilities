My friends and I were here the first night they were open, and I've had a few meals and market shopping visits since then. Chef Ayers is a super nice guy and always takes time to say hi to you when he's there. I like that he also offers things like quinoa pasta for my friends who have glutten allergies. Chicken sausage and eggs, duck dumplings, drumettes, shirt ribs and steak are some of our goto's. It's been a while, I think it's time for a revisit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}
