When you get there and you look at GSG from the outside you wonder if that really is the place you are going to. But then you enter, and it's a really nice ambience, normally packed with people at the bar, lively but not excessively noise! The cocktail selection is good (the spritz is great as an aperitivo), I got the hanger steak with broccoli and potatoes and it's good... but the ricotta fritters are by far my favourite part of the menu now! In the area there are a number of alternative places (Central Kitchen, Rangzen...). I now go to GSG when I am looking for something informal, relaxed, and quality food!", "business_id": "JdWplSS3RfBFamm4FshtcA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-08", "type": "review"}
