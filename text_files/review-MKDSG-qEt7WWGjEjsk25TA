I decided to give it another chance because I noticed the calories wasn't as bad as expected. The food is good and seemed to have improved because they now make claims about how their meat is raised and blah blah.  The thing about this specific Chipotle that bothers me is the interior decor. Something about the metallic seating reminds me too much of like nasty downtown locations, metro buses, and beach restrooms. It just looks disgusting and dirty no matter how you maintain it. I know this is the look all Chipotles are going for but it seriously bothers me. Otherwise food is O-K.", "business_id": "JtQI62zBQWmXOIUT2_RoIg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-16", "type": "review"}
