They have some interesting choices on the menu, and there is a lot to choose from. I enjoy their tostada bowls from time to time. They also have a pretty good breakfast burrito. Both are of a good size. Not too big and not too small. The quality of ingredients is decent, and they tastes pretty good. The restaurant has a fair amount of seating. If you've had good Mexican food before, this isn't going to cut it, but because they deliver and are open late, it's a decent option in Westwood.", "business_id": "Jb7TuFTJJuyde5IIJHUa5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-12", "type": "review"}
