With its prime waterfront location and chic fish taco pink hued decor, this could have been Providence's Senor Frogs or a throwback to 1980's Miami. Instead, you get a so called \"tequila bar\"  specializing in water flavored tequila that liberally dilutes the fruity drinki-mix heavy cocktails the place offers. As if destroying that part of the concept wasn't enough, the food's nothing great either. The menu is standard mexican fare, with varying proportions of beans, meat and cheese thrown together to mildly approximate what mexican food should be like. I could taste the freezer burn on my tamales and the mediocrity of the tostada. Although they offer a variety of salsas to go with your meal, the difference between each feels nonexistent. Whatever this place could be....it isn't.", "business_id": "7H5fb4BnnaX3IT4DPb724Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-10", "type": "review"}
