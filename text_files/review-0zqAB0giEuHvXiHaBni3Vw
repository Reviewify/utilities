Daedalus has great food and great drinks--you have clearly read that in other reviews, yet I'm not here to tell you about that. If you're excited about the (beautiful) rooftop BEWARE!  Here's why: Once you climb the top of the stairs, you will encounter a SURPRISING HILL that is NOT MARKED nor noticeable because the place is SO dark.  My friends and I were leaving the rooftop and one of our friends took a huge stumble down the unmarked hill and luckily only dropped her sweater.  Had we been irresponsible and full of liquor, this stumble could have been so much worse. BEWARE OF THE HILL AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS--you will thank me later.", "business_id": "E_vKoJ0zvpfAcEkQGS4d2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-02", "type": "review"}
