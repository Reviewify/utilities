She is an amazingly sweet person, she listened to my needs and produced a product I love. My color was spot on and my cut was the best I've had in years. I plan to go back to the salon to have my hair both cut and colored by Elise on a regular basis. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the A.C. was not working when I was in (It was the beginning of Aug. in NYC - UM HELLO!?!). I was okay for most of the appointment and was offered water often, but during the end of my appointment (blow drying) I was sweating a lot and that is not something I want to do while having my hair done. I consider the times when I go to the salon as periods of relaxation and sweating so much that I left thigh imprints in the chair thus resulting in an awkward attempt at a joke about not peeing myself ;-) was not relaxing. This is not a stylist problem, but owner/mgmt. My comment is for them: if your AC is out, close shop and fix it! For future clients, AMAZING and SUPER staff, call ahead on the day of if it is sweltering outside....", "business_id": "Pt5lXkpGD1LRv0zLpCn0KA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-03", "type": "review"}
