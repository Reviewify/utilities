So what's a carnivore to do when they crave meat, but have a vegetarian friend in tow? The answer: Ruby's. Here they have an excellent assortment of natural grass fed brisket and hormone free sausage and all sorts of other smoked meats from humanely treated livestock. They got this guy \"T-bone\" who works the smoke room and man since he hit the scene the flavor has never been richer. And their sides are just amazing! I like most their collard greens and the cole slaw myself, but you will find your own delight as you talk it out with the counterpeople and discuss your side cravings. And of course they have the best selection of vegetarian items of any BBQ I've been to. They serve RC cola and brew their own Iced Tea never from concentrate.", "business_id": "odf4UIHxEsyEfSsa9vKXDQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-11-29", "type": "review"}
