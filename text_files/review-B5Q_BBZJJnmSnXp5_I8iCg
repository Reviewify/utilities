I stumbled upon this place right when it opened (the place before it used to sell woofle waffles? whatever) and the owners are so friendly, they're the reason why I keep coming back. The mama in the front is very sociable and can strike up a conversation about nearly anything (the weather, the importance of wearing your retainers, why students should carry chump change with them more often, etc). She's the best! The papa in the back takes his time making the panini, but he does it with love. And they're very generous with their coffee. I ordered a small latte to pour in my thermos and the guy ended up making me a large so I could fill it up. :) People usually take their orders to go. Don't do that. \"If you stay, I'll give you a fruit cup!\" I stayed.", "business_id": "yNW1FXy0mSMBipgCA6Pmhg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-12", "type": "review"}
