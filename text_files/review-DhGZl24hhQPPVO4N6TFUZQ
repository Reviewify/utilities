I have not been here for lunch or dinner yet, but their breakfast is exceptional. I have eaten breakfast here several times, and each time the food is divine, the service is good, and the ambiance is likeable. Highly recommended for breakfast! Especially their Eggs Sardou (Eggs Benedict with artichoke bottoms in place of the English muffin...with a side of delicious creamed spinach)...YUM!!", "business_id": "g3xfHVpKPQPL5NrZIqx6qg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-04", "type": "review"}
