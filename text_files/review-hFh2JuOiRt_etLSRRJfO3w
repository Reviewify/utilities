I went to Craigie on a Friday night and they were packed. We were told we could not have a table in the bar area because they were reserved, but after a half hour and a few drinks we asked a server passing by. He reported back to us that the tables indeed were not reserved but just that the kitchen couldn't handle any more traffic at the moment. Nevertheless he invited us to sit at a table and promised to come by and take our order as soon as he could. Maybe this situation waiting for the table would have seemed annoying if I had a specific timeline, but I like to enjoy my drinks, and I like to enjoy my food and thus, I was happy to have a long and leisurely meal - particularly in the name of serving quality food. In any case I am not a pork person ever- really - but for some reason I felt inspired by the pork dish on the menu that night - I believe it was pork served three ways. Absolutely phenomenal, you may be reading the words of the converted when it comes to pig. I also recall the oysters being particularly fresh and my drink made with organic Rain vodka and sage to be strikingly refreshing. I therefore wholeheartedly recommend Craigie on Main to anyone who appreciates good food and drink, AND who importantly has the time to wait at this very busy Cambridge spot.", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-18", "type": "review"}
