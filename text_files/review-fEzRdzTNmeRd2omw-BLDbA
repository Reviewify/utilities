I think this place has a lot of potential but is rough around the edges. I went with my wife and son so we sampled a lot of things; I got both a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant (which they should have labeled \"pain au chocolat\"!). The plain one was good but the chocolate one had the bread all wrong. My son got a cheese omelete but it was kind of hard on the outside and he didn't like it. My wife got the chicken pesto crepe, which she said was good. We also had some samples of a brownie they had out on the table. You order at the counter and they give you a number to put on the table and then bring out the food to you when it's ready. The location is nice (and there's an outdoor part out back). Bathroom was clean. Prices are a little high but there are some less expensive items on the menu. Nothing really wrong with this place, I feel like there's more on the menu to try and I'll probably find a favorite. I will probably end up checking it out again if I am in the area after I have tried a few other places on my list first. A 3-star type establishment.", "business_id": "PTQVaWA-I5ZLzwy5oBbVMg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-18", "type": "review"}
