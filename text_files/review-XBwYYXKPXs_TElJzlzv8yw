There was one person ahead of me in line. The place was well staffed, but not terribly busy. The man in front of me orders. Then I order my small dry cappuccino, for here. He gets his drink. And I wait. And wait. And wait. And I start to wonder, what is going on? Why is it taking so long for my small drink? I hear the barista working. I hear the machine frothing. I hear her spooning. I hear the machine frothing some more. I start to think, maybe she overheated the foam a few times and had to start again from scratch. But then, the truth is revealed http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=PipGc4TdxurGizJ6CKmU7Q&select=_7c0yQsC6o66LJqmR7u-fA&start=0 The ridiculous cups at STB require the poor barista to create about 1 1/2 cups of foam for a single shot of espresso. That poor poor woman. Diligently scooping foam, and then having to make more and more to fill up the bottomless pit of the \"small\" glasses. Tragically, all of that foam, made for a terribly unbalanced cappuccino. And most of it went back into the bus-tub. The dimensions of the glass also made the cap next-to-impossible to drink. 2* for the coffee + 1* for sheer force of will and determination.", "business_id": "AZqsal3nzTkwQqxUol_UjA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-17", "type": "review"}
