If I'm paying $7.50 for a hotdog its gotta be really tasty, not the luke-warm plate of garbage we received.  The pepperjack burger was awesome but everything was overpriced. The management handled the moldy hotdog situation in a very friendly and professional way although we felt sick for the rest of the day. Outside of all that the service wasn't great. We waited a really long time for the waitress to stop back and the hostess wasn't any help claiming our waitress was just busy, in a dismissive way.", "business_id": "ZKPrXH_GNW_AtZ31tP3NmA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-28", "type": "review"}
