I definitely recommend checking out ValleyVacations.net if you're planning to stay anywhere in the Northampton/Amherst area.  We wanted to do Northampton area Saturday and go up to Yankee Candle Sunday.  Rates for this place online were $120.  Through ValleyVacations we got the place for $105 and it included a $25 Yankee gift certificate.  Pretty sweet.\n\nAnyways, this place was way nicer than I was expecting.  The only weird thing was the pool was off the lobby ... so you had to walk through the lobby dripping wet after the pool.  Weird.\n\nThe continental breakfast was fairly standard but better than I was expecting (I was expecting coffee & stale donuts), frozen waffles, cereal, oatmeal, english muffins, hard boiled eggs, juice, etc.\n\nThe room was nice, and clean.  You could tell the whole place was either fairly new or newly redone.  Stone tile in the bathroom, nice furniture, nicely decorated.  Big enough, and the bed was comfy!  \n\nHighly recommended!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rgnLzeRSrEUsB_9F9sBxSQ"}
