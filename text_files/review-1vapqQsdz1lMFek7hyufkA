This is what we ordered for our italian night out. Pappa al Pomodoro - soup and my guest said it was good Mushrooms Souffl\u00e9 with Fontana cheese sauce and black truffles. It was ok but I guess I was expecting more since Im a huge mushroom fan. Wide Fettuccine with pheasant and Morels Mushrooms-my dish and it was delicious. Freshly made pasta with morel mushroom. Spiral Pasta with Rapini and sausage=my friend said it was ok. I barely saw any sausage in his dish. The bread they served prior to our meals was fresh. The ambiance of the place is very nice inside. Since it was a beautiful evening we opt for the street patio seating. This place is a bit nicer than your typical Italian restaurant. To experience this meal, you should plan at least 2 hours enjoying it. We were in a hurry to see a movie so our meal was a bit rushed. I will definately be back to try some more of their dishes.", "business_id": "wlbTsPLxHom0lYdROsngsA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-03", "type": "review"}
