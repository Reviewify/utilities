This is what we ordered for our italian night out.\nPappa al Pomodoro - soup and my guest said it was good\nMushrooms Souffl\u00e9 with Fontana cheese sauce and black truffles. It was ok but I guess I was expecting more  since Im a huge mushroom fan.\nWide Fettuccine with pheasant and Morels Mushrooms-my dish and it was delicious.  Freshly made pasta with morel mushroom.\nSpiral Pasta with Rapini and sausage=my friend said it was ok.  I barely saw any sausage in his dish.\nThe bread they served prior to our meals was fresh.\nThe ambiance of the place is very nice inside.  Since it was a beautiful evening we opt for the street patio seating.  This place is a bit nicer than your typical Italian restaurant.   To experience this meal, you should plan at least 2 hours enjoying it.  We were in a hurry to see a movie so our meal was a bit rushed.  I will definately be back to try some more of their dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wlbTsPLxHom0lYdROsngsA"}
