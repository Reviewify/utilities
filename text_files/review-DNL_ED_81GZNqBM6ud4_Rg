The acoustics transcend the crisp and clear notes from the band/singer to the ears of the audience.  Singers/bands with great vocalists really do well here (I saw John Legend and Corinne Bailey Rae here and it was jaw-dropping).  Additionally, no seat is a bad seat as the entire place is very intimate, even the lawn area in the back is awesome.\n\nTips: \n- Even on warm summer nights, it can get chilly due to how the venue is sloped and situated on a hill.  But on cold spring/fall/winter nights, it can get VERY cold.  Dress in layers during those times to avoid getting sick\n- Bathroom lines can be very long, be advised on how much beer you decide to drink\n- Get there early, find street parking, and take a nice stroll to the theater to avoid the mad rush right before show time", "type": "review", "business_id": "ywXXDU2qDrJt7RshO-NN7Q"}
