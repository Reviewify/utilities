Hmmmmm.... I wonder if there's a connection....  Meanwhile, quality and quantity of ingredients has declined substantially.  What was once my favorite place to grab a sandwich isn't even on my list anymore.  Kinda sad. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who complained about the avocado.  The most insulting part of it is that they charge something ridiculous like $1.00 (a huge amount when compared to the total cost of the sandwich) to add extra avocado.  In my experience, even if you pay for extra, there's still not enough on there to actually taste it. Paradiso is located in the same building as the JJ's on Lincoln, and is a MUCH better sandwich for about the same price.  I'd recommend going there instead.", "business_id": "EZOoB2D8uQHV_gJoGCMTxQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}
