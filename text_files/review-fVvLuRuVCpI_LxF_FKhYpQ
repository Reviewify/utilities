Getting a cup for water and really filling up with lemonade Cons: 1. Unfriendly service (mostly by their macho he-man staff) 2. Waiting, in full view, for at least 10 minutes for food that had been prepared and sat on the baker's rack because the two incompetent men behind the counter stood and stared at us instead of serving us our already paid for food. 3. Being told, \"Can't you see that this line is closed? You have to go into the other line!\" by one of the cashiers whose line was obviously not closed, but he would rather lie to a customer rather than provide reliable service. 4. The sickening feeling that my boyfriend and I were being treated badly because we're QUEER (maybe I'm wrong, but I'm probably right - have you ever been to SLO before?)", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-12", "type": "review"}
