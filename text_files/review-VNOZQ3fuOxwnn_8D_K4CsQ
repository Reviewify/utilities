I got mine with the caprese salad + chicken noodle soup. The caprese salad was pretty good and tasted very fresh. The chicken noodle soup was a little odd. It tasted a little different than I was expecting and what I was used to. Nonetheless, the combo was very reasonably priced, my salad was fresh, I just chose to go with the wrong soup.", "business_id": "LLqd2BL-na6fQbIPks4-Cg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-21", "type": "review"}
