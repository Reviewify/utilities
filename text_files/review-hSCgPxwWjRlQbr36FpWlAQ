It seemed like a cool place to go since they stated belly dancers on Friday nights plus the hookah for those who like it. I made the reservations in advance. We showed up and our waiter didn't bother introducing himself until 10-15 min. We were left alone without any request for beverages or bread at least being made. The food is what redeemed this place. Their steak kabob was delicious, very juicy and tender. After a few drinks I decided to put the horrible beginning behind us and enjoy the rest of the night.", "business_id": "6v31gzvJ0A_8-JVPjgcF_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-08", "type": "review"}
