He is pricey. And he might just make YOU look like a million bucks! I have been to Richard at Dean of Shadyside twice for cuts. I am the sort who sits down and says, \"I don't care what you do, just give me a great haircut.\" Before cutting, Richard administers a sort-of consultation during which you have the chance to express your preferences until he gets a wild look in his eyes, indicating he has decided what he is going to do and seductively explains it in such a way that you can't refuse. He has a wildly ambitious passion that will make you wonder about taking him to bed, though no doubt about it, it's going to be all about him. The first cut was probably the best I've ever had. It was the sort of style that warranted countless compliments from friends and strangers alike. My most recent cut included a lap dance to the entirety of Estefan's \"Turn the Beat Around.\" Inviting eye contact, check. Suggestive pelvic motions, oh yes. Risky jump onto rotating chair, tip increase. Flips of the hair (mine), obviously. Clipping all the while! What more could I have asked for other than for him to \"take it all off!?\" Luckily, I maintained composure and did walk out with a decent mid-length haircut. So, between the two experiences, I do feel that I got great bangs for my bucks. Bangs on my head, expert blow jobs and a comic fantasy for a fuck. My only real issue with this salon is the atmosphere. It has about as much character as Super Cuts and operates like a busy factory, each master stylist having his own minions to order about. The music, though occasionally a turn on for the stylists, is generally bad.", "business_id": "3BBkhChwKTEx9l83bIl1ng", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-24", "type": "review"}
