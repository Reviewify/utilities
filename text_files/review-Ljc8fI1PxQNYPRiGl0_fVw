This apartment's management is absolutely, unbelievably horrible.  Not only is the management unresponsive( Our front door was broken for the first six months of our lease, and even after filing multiple maintenance requests there was no attempt to fix it.), the management is extremely rude as well.  They seemingly randomly have construction with no warning, turn the water on and off with same-day or no notice at all, and are just a general pain to deal with. The icing on the cake and reason I am leaving this review is because my car was broken into while it was parked inside one of the parking structures.  My car window was smashed and everything  inside taken, and not only did the management make no effort to help nor investigate the issues, it took days to even contact the management to let them know of the situation.  When I finally got in touch with the management, they were not willing to meet on my time, and I had to come in during their 'office hours' and basically had to wait outside the office while she talked to a prospective client. It's been a week now and the broken glass in the parking structure has still not been cleaned up and no response to the fact that a burglary happened has been taken. The apartment is fine, the management is complete trash.", "business_id": "NgSQYOfPP34imBcr8IXbVg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-05-30", "type": "review"}
