The manager/host was extremely rude to my family from the minute we set foot inside. I've never been treated so poorly at a restaurant. While this place has a kid's menu it is NOT kid friendly. The waitress did not give us a second to breath before she was asking us what we wanted to drink. In addition, their food is nothing to write home about. I will never be returning to this restaurant again and neither should you.", "business_id": "fqglBnvsDzii6hxQ5a78cQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-05-08", "type": "review"}
