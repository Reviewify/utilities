It is a beautiful room for casual dining. There is a salad bar, a grill, and a sandwich station for your eating pleasure. They have waffle-cut fries that are to die for.\nThe times I have been to the Kerr formal dining room (by reservation), the food was blah and the service was inconsistent.\nI have had to book a few events there since it is so close to work. Their event planning staff was not personable, but I understand that there has been some turnover, so maybe now things are better. The serving staff was unprofessional.\nBasically, I like going there to get a sandwich or a burger, but not for much else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uFSNQ_zQa2xCEcrkDFOH3w"}
