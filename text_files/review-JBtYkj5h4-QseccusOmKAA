They have the best ice cream sundae in town.. THE MISPRINT.. Its small and the perfect size for desert--(And its under $4) I feel this is a great date place or conversation place because you could just order shakes and nothing else and stay for hours without being rushed out by wait staff. They also have incredible shakes, and rueben sandwiches.", "business_id": "o13eH93qmWVNFZogkjhd9w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-26", "type": "review"}
