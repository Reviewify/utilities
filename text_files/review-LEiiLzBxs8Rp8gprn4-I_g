Nothing spectacular.  But it'll get your tummy fed.  Isn't that the point when its rainy and you don't wanna cook?\n\nRama garden is sparce.\nPad Thai is a bit salty.\nSweet rice is good.\n\nStay away from the massaman curry.  You can do better.  \nThe coconut curry is heavy as usual but not as oily as other places do....\n\nI'd say that if theres one thing to always get here -- drunken noodles.  You order it expecting the oil to coat your throat, right? It won't disappoint.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aRKDmJRynUacchS2_3yFKQ"}
