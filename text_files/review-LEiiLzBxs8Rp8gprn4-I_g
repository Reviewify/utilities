But it'll get your tummy fed. Isn't that the point when its rainy and you don't wanna cook? Rama garden is sparce. Pad Thai is a bit salty. Sweet rice is good. Stay away from the massaman curry. You can do better. The coconut curry is heavy as usual but not as oily as other places do.... I'd say that if theres one thing to always get here -- drunken noodles. You order it expecting the oil to coat your throat, right? It won't disappoint.", "business_id": "aRKDmJRynUacchS2_3yFKQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-19", "type": "review"}
