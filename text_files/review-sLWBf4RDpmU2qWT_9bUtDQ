It was a set menu of $35. I expected golden eggs for that price...sad to say that I didn't get any:) I think I'm too price sensitive for a $35 dollars..with my student budget and all. I know it's me...not them. It's a nice place to bring your parents to if they will pay for it. Just give them a fair warning- NO GOLDEN EGGS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uSM_sCp22BJWeatTDl6ODA"}
