I've gone to Douglas J eXchange numerous times over the past 2 years, and I have become a great fan. Here's why: 1.  The head massage! Before they wash your hair, they let you pick your favorite aromatherapy oils and they give you a head massage. It's awesome! I didn't think I'd be into pampering, but it's a very relaxing way to start a hair cut. Plus, sometimes there's another staff member who walks around and offers (free) hand massages while you're getting your hair cut. Talk about service! 2.  The \"no-tip\" policy! I don't know about you, but I always get nervous when it comes time to pay the stylist. How much do you tip? 10%? 20%? What if he/she just gave you an amazing head massage and another staff person massaged your hands? Well, here they don't allow tipping, so you never have to worry about it! If they say the price of a haircut is $35, then it really IS $35. Well done, Douglas J, well done. 3.  Each time I've come here, I've had a different stylist cut my hair. Some have been better than others, but all of them would be rated 3 or more stars. So I'd say you're safe with any stylist (fyi - I usually go with the less experienced stylists since they're less expensive). All of them have been super nice and friendly. In short, this is by far the best value for your money out of any salon in Ann Arbor. Highly recommended!", "business_id": "ovB6zaO3xopgrY0hsVzzTw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-20", "type": "review"}
