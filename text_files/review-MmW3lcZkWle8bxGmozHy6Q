MM: Well, let's see. I guess I would say that I'm unique, kind of weird, and a little bit creepy. You: Okay, I'm all about creepy. Tell me more about yourself. What makes you so unique? MM: I possess specimens that you won't see anywhere else. I have everything from shrunken heads to tumors in jars. I have a mummified woman whose adipose tissue has turned to soap, fetal skeletons at every stage of prenatal development, and my personal favorite, a giant colon. You: I'm sold on the giant colon. But before I hire you, can you tell me what sort of an effect you'll have on my wallet? MM: I like to think that my pricing is fair. I ask only 10 bones from students, 14 from the general public. I may or may not accept real bones. You: Great! You're hired. I look forward to being creeped out by you at my earliest convenience.", "business_id": "giUvelDX9OPw7aiF7grvEA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-11", "type": "review"}
