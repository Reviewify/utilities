I guess I would say that I'm unique, kind of weird, and a little bit creepy.\nYou: Okay, I'm all about creepy. Tell me more about yourself. What makes you so unique?\nMM: I possess specimens that you won't see anywhere else. I have everything from shrunken heads to tumors in jars. I have a mummified woman whose adipose tissue has turned to soap, fetal skeletons at every stage of prenatal development, and my personal favorite, a giant colon. \nYou: I'm sold on the giant colon. But before I hire you, can you tell me what sort of an effect you'll have on my wallet? \nMM: I like to think that my pricing is fair. I ask only 10 bones from students, 14 from the general public. I may or may not accept real bones. \nYou: Great! You're hired. I look forward to being creeped out by you at my earliest convenience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "giUvelDX9OPw7aiF7grvEA"}
