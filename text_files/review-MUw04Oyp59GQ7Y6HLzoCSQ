Then you get a bowl and a tray and go to town. They have a selection of beef, pork, chicken, a lot of veggies, tofu, pineapple, etc. They say not to pack your bowl, but it's hard not to. Once you're done creating your mini food mountain, you hand over the bowl to the Wok Master and he cooks it all up with noodles and adds a side of rice if you want. The meal is tasty, and I always leave very full. This is the spot i love to got to when I'm making the six hour trip from So-Cal to San Francisco. Flame Bay may have a questionable name, but the food is good and they have a nice selection of domestic and imported beer that keeps me coming back.", "business_id": "beQTssrbPuz2Rr_OjDMyfQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-02", "type": "review"}
