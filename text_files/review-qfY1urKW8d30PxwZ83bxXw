Good, not great, but a tasty and fun spot for higher-end Mexican and margs.\n\nWe tried:\n-Guac and chips: like most higher-end Mexican places, this was completely overpriced...but pretty necessary to kick off the meal\n-Camarones (shrimp) ceviche: just ok, tasted like shrimp in spicy cocktail sauce\n-Costillas (short rib) huaraches: Similar to a flatbread - really tasty, good portion size for sharing b/w two people, great flavors\n-Carne kobe tacos: Tasty but drowning in truffle oil. Comes with three per serving\n\nAll in all, seems like a good spot for margs and small bites, but not sure I would come here for a full meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g"}
