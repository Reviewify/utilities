Good, not great, but a tasty and fun spot for higher-end Mexican and margs. We tried: -Guac and chips: like most higher-end Mexican places, this was completely overpriced...but pretty necessary to kick off the meal -Camarones (shrimp) ceviche: just ok, tasted like shrimp in spicy cocktail sauce -Costillas (short rib) huaraches: Similar to a flatbread - really tasty, good portion size for sharing b/w two people, great flavors -Carne kobe tacos: Tasty but drowning in truffle oil. Comes with three per serving All in all, seems like a good spot for margs and small bites, but not sure I would come here for a full meal.", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}
