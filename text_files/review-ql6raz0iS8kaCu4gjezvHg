The wait can be a quite a while though when there are people there. Don't be afraid of the exterior of this place because the interior is pretty warm.  I usually go with the Pad See Eew when I dine in. When I take food to go I go with the same or with Pad Kee Mao with a Red Curry and I make some rice at home. They often mess up your orders (give you different kind of meat that you ask for).. so make sure you have what you ordered. Check this place out if you're in the area but not a place to go out of your way for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "93sW9Y_3rJQn305_n8epng"}
