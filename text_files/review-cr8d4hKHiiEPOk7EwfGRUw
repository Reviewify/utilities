I honestly didn't realize that the standard I'd been okay with was sub-par. But I know now. Because I've seen Dr. Chan.  First off, their office. I want to kick them out and move in *immediately*. High Ceilings, all wood floors, amazing windows.  Only one exam room means the focus is on your animal and *only* your animal for the duration of the visit. And that exam room is pretty awesome. How awesome? An old steel doctor's cabinet, filled with useful items, is topped by a cat skeleton looking quite happy in his black cape and round wire spectacles. Yes, there is a cat skeleton dressed like Harry Potter in the exam room. I knew then there was no room in my heart for any other vet. And this was all before Dr. Chan walked in the room.  She is knowledgeable, efficient, friendly, gave me options, has a true love for her work, flexible and kind. Bonus: She has experience with my breed of dog, which isn't common AT ALL.  My little guy has had an ongoing problem with allergies in his life and no other vet, ever, has offered any sort of treatment beyond 'make him take this pill'. Dr. Chan had a plethora of ideas, starting with 'very affordable' and only working up to 'something I haven't even done for myself' as a last resort.    The woman working the front desk was unbelievably helpful. I'd asked my dog's previous vet(s) to fax in all his information and they hadn't. She smiled, and began calling them herself. ALL OFFICE STAFF IN AUSTIN TAKE NOTE: THIS IS HOW YOU OPERATE.  I really can't think of a single bad thing to say. As long as I live in Austin, my pup will be in Dr. Chan's care.", "business_id": "sKkpR5IKqn5lptVk_G1MXQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-10", "type": "review"}
