My bf couldn't stop raving about the attention to detail: the dimmer on the lit-up table, the mix CD that came in the CD player (and they apparently have a whole CD and DVD library you can rent from), the extra toilet paper roll in a little bag labeled \"the backup plan,\" the doorbell so you actually hear when the cleaning service is going to come in, the punch at the front desk, etc.  The pool was a little small, and the bouncer at the bar downstairs wouldn't let in my friend in a collared shirt because he was wearing flip flops, but otherwise our stay was fantastic and I'd definitely come back if I had the cash!", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-22", "type": "review"}
