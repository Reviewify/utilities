They offer breakfast and snacks but there are eateries within short driving distance.  The rooms were comfortable and clean but we still saw a crawling critter.  The workout facility is very small but you can still get it in.  I doubt I would stay here again, but it was ok for a short trip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "V9bsN3Y0vSH85xaAt5nyxQ"}
