I was there wednesday night and the bartender made the guy next to me this rosemary maple syrup Bourbon drink that he thought was great, so I had to try one as well. It was really, really good! We were just having drinks, but the food looked, and smelled, great, and I'm planning on taking my wife back for a nice dinner on saturday. As I understand, this place has just barely opened, and if its this good already, it must be a winner!", "business_id": "PSL_ln24XidWdTjnXgmkNQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-06", "type": "review"}
