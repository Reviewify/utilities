The lady at the counter was very friendly and asked if I had been there before. When I said no, she quickly gave me a run down of what they offer.\n\nI chose the two beef stick plate with rice. The flavor of the meat was delicious. Nicely seasoned and just the right amount of char from the grill. I had barbecue sauce to go with it, but didn't even use it, because I really liked the meat as it was. The rice was also very good.\n\nThey also had these really good looking cupcakes on display, but I resisted.\n\nOverall it was a good meal for a good price and definitely a satisfying and reasonably healthy option in Dobie. I will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5eFcQAl8BkWB6gtrZN3NKQ"}
