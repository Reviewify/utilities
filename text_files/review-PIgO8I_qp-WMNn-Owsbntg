As I stood in line to get in the door, slowly loosing the ability to feel my fingers, I felt a blast of warmth blow over me from above. As I was whisked away by the current of heat flowing from their outdoor heater, I realized that they gave even half a shit about people standing outside. Yes the heater was truly there for the smokers, and I myself being part of this animated bunch appreciated it as such.  Once we were inside, the bar itself is a little crowded, but the crowd was decent and everyone seemed to be having a good time. While there was a line to get to the bar, the bartenders handled the crowd pretty easily which is always plus when you've been waiting in line to get in for a half an hour.  The DJ on Saturday night was cool, playing everything from top forty to old school....yes there was a Bell Biv Devoe came on and if you cant have fun dancing to Poison, its official that you just suck at life. While I was outside smoking a butt shooting the shit with the bouncer about some of the absolutely terrible dancing inside, he informed me that its usually like that on Saturday nights and as he broke into an Elaine reference from Seinfeld, I almost passed out as what I saw on the floor was damn close. I was a good dancer there and I dance like I've been hit in the ankles with hammers.  Overall the bar was cool, I definitely check it out again. There was a lot of pretentious people there, but you cant have everything in life. I definitely recommend Saturday nights as bad dancing is probably one of my favorite things in the world!", "business_id": "JKLdvBm0AblJmyEgJaa56A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-03-02", "type": "review"}
