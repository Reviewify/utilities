Gotta get the seafood soup with lemon grass and their calamari for appetizer, then go with fried rice with crab meat and mango juice, really delicious.. Even though their mango juice isn't pure but it was okay, since i love mango. :D Price is average and they serve the food pretty fast so, i really highly recommended to whoever love Thai cuisine, worth to try!", "business_id": "IcLm9Z1zphLnzUvrFK6aiA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-12", "type": "review"}
