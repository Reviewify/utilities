The kind of good where you can't eat one fry at a time. You have to fork at least 5 or 6 fries with all the toppings and stuff it in your mouth as if you were playing the chubby bunny marshmallow game. The meat (beef or pork, your choice), combined with the sauce, sriracha, and kim chi complement each other really well. I do not have any complaints. Their quesadillas are really good. Needs more filling, but other than that, the flavor is all there. I have a cousin who is an extremely picky eater. EXTREMELY. Well, she happens to LOVE Oh My Gogi! I'd use another term, but I'm not sure what's bigger than \"love\"..obsessed? I don't know, but she loves it enough to scream that she wants it any time she drinks, make a shout out to Oh My Gogi! at her own wedding, go there AFTER her wedding to grub, and leave her bubble in Cy-Fair (which she rarely ever does) to travel to the Village just for some quesadillas and kimchi fries. This may not really sound like much, but for this girl, this tells you a lot about how delish Oh My Gogi! is. If it's good enough for her to crave 24/7, it's more than good enough for the rest of the world.", "business_id": "p7SZnq-msIbO5oElxyuIxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-18", "type": "review"}
