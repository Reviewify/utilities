I never understood why it was always so empty. This is probably one of the many hidden gems around campus. Tired of dining hall food? Need a break between classes? Drop in for a quick beer. They also have great food and daily specials. They have delicious sandwiches - I particularly fancied the ham grenade. Yesterday, I stopped by for the first time in a while for Taco Tuesday. While their fish tacos aren't $1, they are still surprisingly good. I even think it beats out Rubio's fish tacos. I also tried their carne asada burrito. Somewhat thin and not as good as your average California burrito, but it sure beats other campus food. This place is also connected to a stage and an outdoor patio to entertain your musical side with bands and open mic nights. The pub has also been renovated within the past year so now they actually have a real bar and also flat screens mounted on the walls!", "business_id": "0IUM6jZ-i5eVYO6WgGqA3w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-13", "type": "review"}
