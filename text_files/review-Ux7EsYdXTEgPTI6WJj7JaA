Due to the massive growth of its signature event (over 30,000 participants each year), Bike New York has evolved into a hybrid sort of organization:  part event management, part advocacy, and part urban cycling education resource for both children and adults. But it's hallmark is clearly the five boro tour (it really only kisses the Bronx, so the name's a glamorous technicality).  To many a New Yorker and tri-state resident, this is a spring ritual.  To many others who live nowhere near the city of cities, it's a must-do-before-you-die kind of thing.  It is utter splendid mayhem on two wheels. How many people who live in NYC really venture out of their own, or immediate neighboring borough?  Really?  An event like this is significant in that it gives New Yorkers and and devotees of the Big Apple the chance to see so much of the metropolis in a day... on their own power, and with the privilege of full road closure.  Imagine riding your bike on car-free FDR, 59th Street Bridge, BQE, Gowanus, Verazzano bridge.  Then witness the same bad habits drivers espouse on these roadways in their cars... only on their bikes this time.  Specific examples: Erratic lane and direction changing Infuriating speed variation and gridlock Opportunists drafting in the wake of emergency vehicles Chronic weaving in and out of traffic (the only way you'll get to travel faster than 15mph, I think) But ya gotta love it.  Even if, time after time, you'd swear they ought to just name this thing WALK YOUR BIKE, NEW YORK.  And even if you have to maintain your alert and sense ALL.  THE.  TIME.  As you never know when the next idiot surrounded by at least 50 moving bikes is gonna decide with fleeting judgment of a squirrel to stop and take a picture of the skyline. Many repeat participants have devised their own methods of getting clear of the crowds during this event.  I'd share some, if not for the fear of being lynched by the event organizers, the City fo New York, and the folks who've developed their genius plans (pssst, it's no secret, fellas).  But really, I think anybody who experiences this for the first time ought to see it in its messy whole.
