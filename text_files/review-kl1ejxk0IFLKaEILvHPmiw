Big and obnoxious! Growing up in an all Gentile neighborhood the kids in my elementary school just didn't get it. I remember one girl used to get a hard boiled egg, a slice of bread and an apple. So I'd always give her the other half.  Well me and my stacked meat sandwiches were a revelation compared to the PB J's and 1 Slice of cheese sandwiches that I witnessed all around me in the cafeteria during lunchtime! oh yeah, back to the review. I had the whitefish platter and finally tried out the Cel-Ray soda that my boyfriend had been raving about. The amount of food I received on my platter made 4 sandwiches. So there was plenty of take home. Which I tentatively hid in the back of the fridge so my bo wouldn't find it. (he's such a foodie) This place is a little heaven and the service was great. Jill was my waitress and a real doll. She said the tips weren't great which i was hard pressed to believe but I still slipped her a 40% tip. I recommend this place highly. Food was fresh, mounds and mounds, even the Q-tips at the Early birds in Florida would be jealous! * Q-Tips are Seniors with white hair.. get it :)", "business_id": "Zqd_DHAtrdzRJ8u3zwrvEA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-03", "type": "review"}
