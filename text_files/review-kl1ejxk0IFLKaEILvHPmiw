(he's such a foodie) this place is a little heaven and the service was great. jill was my waitress and a real doll. she said the tips weren't great which i was hard pressed to believe but i still slipped her a 40% tip. i recommend this place highly. food was fresh, mounds and mounds, even the q-tips at the early birds in florida would be jealous! * q-tips are seniors with white hair.. get it :)", "business_id": "Zqd_DHAtrdzRJ8u3zwrvEA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-03", "type": "review"}
