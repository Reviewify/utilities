The service was great and the waitresses were very quick to supply our whole table with drinks and appetizers, also very friendly. However, most of us ordered the $17.99 New York Strip and $25+ Fillet Minion.  I was excited to order a rare NY strip as the menu advertised a beautifully seasoned cut.  Although I was let down when I received a fully gray, overly well done piece of meat.    Talk about getting it wrong. . . Most of our steaks were cooked no where near what we ordered, mashed potatoes were also slightly cold.  Would have enjoyed a steak from OUTBACK or BLACK ANGUS much better and for half the price.  Could tell the meat used was quality and had good flavor, but if your looking for an incredible steak dinner experience, dont even consider spending the extra cash. Not sure what the cooks were thinking back there besides cranking out plates of food on the assembly line.  In the end I felt bad for our waitress when she caught what the cooks had done without any of us saying a word. Good service, but poor execution in the kitchen...", "business_id": "oIgx5AEdeBnsibH7GJc2fg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-20", "type": "review"}
