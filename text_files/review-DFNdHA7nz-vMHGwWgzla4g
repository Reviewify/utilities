My best friend swears by the falafel and I would have to agree. If you have a sweet tooth I would recommend you try their baklava, it is light and and not overly sweet like alot of others I have had in the past. The owners are great as well. Everything here is fresh and healthy for you. Also the prices are very reasonable. This place is a must have even if you aren't from the area, trust me I have seen plenty of people come from out of town to get a taste of Saca's again because they miss it. As far as the new sandwich is concerned the spicy chicken sandwich, it is the fricking bomb! it is the same chicken they use for the shawerma only it has been marinated in their own blend of herbs and spices. Tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice. This is my new favorite....:P", "business_id": "H92b_Ikez92uf7CQ-pjoXQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-10", "type": "review"}
