HAPPY HOUR: blood orange margaritas $6, try it...you will love it! Goat cheese cakes $6...they come out warm and with flat crackers...I hate sharing them. DINNER: seared ahi tuna & crunchy chicken are my all time favorites both come out cooked to perfection BRUNCH: crunchy french toast & chicken and waffles...buy them both and don't share. You will be fat but you will be HAPPY. Service never fails to be the best & all the waitstaff know their stuff. They recently updated the decor at this original location & they did a great job of keeping it chic & classy. I prefer this Benjy's over the Washington location because it is cozier & the drinks taste way better.", "business_id": "YDD0n84xkd_nHmkmPorG5Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-31", "type": "review"}
