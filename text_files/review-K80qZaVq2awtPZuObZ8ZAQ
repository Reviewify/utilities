My tenure at Michigan brought my first sushi experience, among other things. Sadly, as freshmen we didn't know any better so my first sushi was not at Sadako. But I'm pretty sure we made up for it by living next door to Sadako our junior year (1329 1/2 South U... whaddup). There is no other better sushi place out there. I crave this sushi. I would give up my first born to be able to eat a Johnny Boy roll on a daily basis. Sometimes I contemplate making the 6 hour round trip drive to Ann Arbor just to indulge in Sadako. Since graduating college, I've tried many other sushi joints across the country and nothing compares to Sadako - the quality of ingredients, the prices, the stuffed to the brim rolls, the fact that the crack-laced miso soup and salad comes free w/ your meal (even for take out). I thought all specialty rolls did not exceed $10 because I was so spoiled from Sadako. This isn't a fine dining joint and don't expect razzle dazzle service. They're always packed so sometimes you might be waiting a little longer than you like for your food but it's worth it. If you don't want to experience mediocre service, just get take out or delivery. Note: I am basing this review off visiting Sadako from 2004-2008. Last I had Sadako was November 2010 and everything was still the same as I had remembered. Prices and the whole soup and salad thing may no longer be the case.", "business_id": "3D7cU-oTIyeI18UPuT1LQQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-03", "type": "review"}
