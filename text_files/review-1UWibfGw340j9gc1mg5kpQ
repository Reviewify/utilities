It's a sizable teppan grill restaurant with a sushi bar on the side.  I've never tried the sushi so can't comment on it. I always get the same thing at Tokyo Kitchen -- the Tokyo Special Dinner -- steak and chicken, with the fried mixed veggies and shrimp and mushrooms on the side.  Comes with a salad (so-so) and soup (very basic, delicate broth-style soup but very tasty) and a side of fried rice.  Their fried rice is most excellent!  I have never had a bad piece of steak or chicken here and they grill it to your liking -- I like mine medium well, others in my party range from medium rare to well and no one has ever complained about what they got. The staff come around several times during the meal to refill waters or iced tea or any other drinks you want to order, and to bus the soup and salad bowls off the table while the chef is performing his combination cooking-entertainment.  I like that everything is cooked right there in front of you and enjoy the show almost as much as the food.  I come every year with the Entertainment card for half price (or two-for-one) and it's well worth it at that price.  Might be a tad expensive otherwise, but you won't go home hungry, that's for sure!", "business_id": "XRMlDR9xjIHE6RVzP3HctQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-15", "type": "review"}
