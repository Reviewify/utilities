I just like food that's made with quality ingredients and tastes great. Labels alone, such as \"raw\" or \"vegan\" don't impress or draw me to a place (especially since I am neither), but sometimes the food can.  Muse's raw lasagna is really delightful and packed with savory, fresh flavors disbursed between alternating layers of zucchini and portobello mushrooms. I especially appreciate this dish in the summer, but it was pretty yummy on a recent crisp January day. I have been here a lot over the past couple of years and the staff are efficient and friendly without fail. Muse earns an extra star for producing quality for amazingly low prices, with many generous sized entrees at about $6.50. Muse attracts a pretty diverse crowd with a range of cooked, non-vegan items too. I sure hope more people discover and support this quality food option near the Berkeley campus.", "business_id": "WdgVF9ppt926xDLfDoZE0g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-29", "type": "review"}
