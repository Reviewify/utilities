Had to wait a VERY long time because the place is TINY (like the size of my living room). We finally were seated, it was very loud and jam packed. The food was AMAZING!!!!!!!!! and dirt cheap my goodness! The sangria....oh my gosh, so freaking great! and soooo inexpensive. I thought I had died and gone to a really crowded garlic scented heaven. If you don't mind the crowds and the wait... give this place a try. it's kinda hidden inside a building but still very good and sooo cheap! DON'T GO WITH A GROUP THOUGH!!!!!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ynhSJscAI1aumkgEBUsO4A"}
