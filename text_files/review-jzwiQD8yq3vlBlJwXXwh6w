Located on Broxton just off the hustle and bustle of Westwood Village, Le Pain Quotidien is a great brunch / lunch place. It was a beautiful summer afternoon in LA so we sat outside and enjoyed our meal al fresco.\n\nI ordered a salad off the seasonal menu - Roasted Peach, Watermelon & Mozzarella di Bufala Salad. The peaches were farmer's market fresh, nicely charred, and served over a bed of mixed greens. Topped with cubes of watermelon, dollops of fresh mozzarella, toasted almonds, and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette, this salad was the epitome of summer and tasted amazing.\n\nMartin had a tartine recommended by our server - Grilled Chicken & Smoked Mozzarella with arugula and basil pesto. Essentially an open faced sandwich, the tartine tasted fresh and well-composed (ie: it didn't fall apart or get soggy). I really liked it and Martin seemed to enjoy it as well.\n\nI will definitely be back, and I love how conveniently located it is - just across the street from the Broxton lot (free parking for 3 hours before 6pm!).", "type": "review", "business_id": "rbc9eyODP68T_DFzIYuNNQ"}
