We had the blood orange margarita and lemonades (without the blueberry) for $6 a piece.  While the drinks were good, the glasses were SMALL.  I wonder if the regular drink comes in such a small glass as they cost $9.50 and would really be a rip-off.   Now I know you are wondering why on earth did she put 4 stars? Well, let me tell you....the roasted pork crepes with portobello mushroom and lemon grass and the pork and vegetable dumplings.  YUMMY.  I was so impressed with the appetizers, which coincidentally were also $6 per, that I am really looking forward to eating a full dinner here.  I would definitely return for more Happy Hour appetizers, but may just order a beer as I know that comes with 12 oz.", "business_id": "YDD0n84xkd_nHmkmPorG5Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-15", "type": "review"}
