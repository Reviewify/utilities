My bff and I wanted something peanut butter and chocolate and voila! She suggests the daily special which is a chocolate chip peanut butter banana cinnamon roll and mmmm~ It was delicious! Although I wish I had heated it up because it's not as enjoyable when it's at room temp.  I also wish that the insides were a bit more gooey-er and cinnamony. \n\nI do love how you can customize your own cinnamon roll and all the different flavors that they offer!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA"}
