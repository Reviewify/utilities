What more can one ask for? Good jukebox upstairs filled with punk and rock. Popular with the tatooed rockers late at night and the weekends. Bands play for a small cover charge on Monday nights. Double cheeseburgers are advertised on the signs outside, and they are a good and cheap, but the various lobster dishes are what I would reccommend. Melts, rolls, or just plain steamed, and at reasonable prices to boot. The double lobster roll special is a good deal for around $10. (I just paid $10.50 for one lobster roll in Maine last weekend). Wash it down with one of their quality draft beers. Doesn't get much better than this.", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA", "stars": 4, "date": "2005-08-26", "type": "review"}
