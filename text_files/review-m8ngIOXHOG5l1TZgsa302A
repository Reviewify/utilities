I went in today and ordered a regular Mexican Tortilla. When the server, Marty, had finished putting it together for me, I suddenly remembered I had forgot my wallet. Instead of holding the soup for me upon my return, he told me to take the soup. Don't worry about it. And just come back when I'm free. HOW NICE IS THAT? I've never had anyone let me walk out with food or drinks on the honor policy. So touched. Anyways, walked back to my apt as fast as I could. Put down the soup, grabbed my wallet, and walked back to SF Soup Co. to pay for my order. Yeah. Today was a good day.", "business_id": "elt6nbq4fRcCn7Enk6e7Tw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-06", "type": "review"}
