Ok, so my friends are stuck in urgent care (I was the driver), and I thought, ok, I'll pick us up some goodies and coffee.   The guy who serves says, this is the large size!  I was SHOCKED!!!!  It was the size of a Starbucks Tall, and the price was like $4.00!!!  What?!?!?!  And, they only give you a single shot of espresso!  Wow... talk about an overpriced mark-up.  EITHER THAT OR THE OWNER IS A TIGHTWAD!  I also decided, well hey, their day old goodies should be in decent shape.  Hmm... let's try some.  I bit into the snickerdoodle.  OMG .... they should change the sign from \"day old\" to \"week old.\"  Two cookies, a large tea, and 2 large mochas ran me $16!!!!!  And they have the nerve to ask for a tip!  Yeah... ok.. here's your tip...YOUR COFFEE IS OVERPRICED AND YOUR SNICKERDOODLES ARE REPULSIVE. I'll take my business elsewhere!", "business_id": "Fh2vlptKk8jyedzCDPbXbw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-29", "type": "review"}
