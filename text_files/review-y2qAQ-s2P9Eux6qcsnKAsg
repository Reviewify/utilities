One time, when I wasn't looking for some of my usual UC area fare like Top Dog, Naan n' Curry, Blondies or even IB's I decided to give this place a try. Healthy is a good thing, at the time I was eating a little too much junk food. I looked at the menu, prices were a bit steep so I ordered the burger combo, which is the cheapest thing there. When asked if I wanted to upgrade to garlic fries I said sure, a free upgrade to garlic fries is always welcome. Except for this time. The garlic wasn't even really cooked, it seemed like somebody scooped some minced garlic from the big Christopher Ranch tub you can get a Costco on the fries. No other seasonings or anything else. The garlic didn't even stick on the fries. The burger was also dry, somehow these guys made Niman Ranch beef taste like the plain non-organic stuff you can get at Food 4 Less. That's oddly amazing. One extra star for being \"healthy\" but in this day an age, healthy doesn't need to equate to \"tastes like crap.\"", "business_id": "Q0j0-u8WHHczEg5c9DPQKg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-06-02", "type": "review"}
