Food was excellent, definitely try a few tapas, don't get an entree. Perfect place for a date, and the drinks here are phenomenal. I would try to go on a day that they have live music (I know they have it Thursday nights). My only complaint is that the venue is kind of lame. It's very nice indoors, but you have to walk through this faux alley to get to the restaurant, they try really hard to make the hallway seem like an alleyway, but generally failed. It was an excellent experience, prices are pretty reasonable, especially for a couple if you get a few tapas and a drink to share.", "business_id": "ynhSJscAI1aumkgEBUsO4A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-19", "type": "review"}
