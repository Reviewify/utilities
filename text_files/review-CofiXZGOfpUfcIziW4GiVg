Fleur de sel was moist, but I personally don't like it because it was too bitter for me (Good for those who like dark choc., not me) and I think the bitterness was overpowering because I couldn't taste the caramel filling. Chocolate velvet tasted exactly the same as fleur de sel minus the carmael. Spring chick was passion fruit and coconut, I didn't like it, it's just not my kind of flavor, but my boy friend liked it. The cupcakes are expensive tome, I think all cupcake boutiques are actually. I only go and buy cupcakes when I'm too lazy to make my own.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A"}
