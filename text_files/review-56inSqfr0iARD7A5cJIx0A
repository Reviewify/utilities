(Does anyone say they \"frequent\" things anymore?) Before I go broke and my body turns to Jell-O, let me share a \"Yay!\" for Spa Connections Mobile Spa service. I was fresh out of the middle seat on a flight from PHL to LAX and my back and leg muscles were looking for some deep tissue. Spa Connections -- recommended by the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, where I was lucky enough to be spending three nights -- sent over Laura F. within an hour. She arrived on the dot with a table and music and a genuine interest in making sure I received the specific treatment I was looking for. As with all of my favorite massage therapists, she was cheerful and genuinely interested in her craft, then once work began she was silent except for quiet check-ins for pressure. I highly recommend Spa Connections in general and Laura F. in particular! I would give this a \"Woohoo!\" but I've only used them once. Looking forward to next time I am in L.A.!", "business_id": "TU2HIXtJ1ChIf2J4whGEyw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-11", "type": "review"}
