Tien helped me get some for my party and I am glad I splurged because all of my guests really enjoyed them. I ordered the chocolate and vanilla and I personally enjoyed the chocolate ones a little better, but the flavor was awesome on both of them. If you are looking for a place for custom cake pops, I highly recommend Sweet Pops.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Rn84UcleEj0aynEb6H_WyA"}
