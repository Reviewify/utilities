However, being that we were here on business, we didn't have to experience it.  In fact, since it was early in the week (and the fact that UCLA was on spring break), we hoped that there was enough foot traffic to liven up the joint.  Monday night was slow through the 10:30pm hour, so we bailed up to the rooms early.  However, Tuesday night, I think there was a convention or meeting in the hotel, so there were many more bodies knocking back drinks. Yes, plenty of beautiful people, but we also saw a pack of what we believed were 'conventioners' or cardiologists.  And also ran into a Scottish family... the father was funny as hell, even though I couldn't understand a word he was saying the first 10 minutes of conversation.  \n\nNonetheless, decor is inviting and warm.  The back area were the smokers lingered had a super comfy enclosure. \n\nBut the best part of it was our bartender... Mari.  She is super smokin' and poured some DELICIOUS drinks.... well, I guess pouring Macallans 18 really takes little skill, but it's the method of presentation that made it that much more tasty! :)\n\nThe crowd on a 'school' night vs. a weekend is totally different so I can't comment on th pretentiousness of the place.  All I know is that I had a great time... what little I remember of it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVaA9PgC1DZ3or4aWa90IQ"}
