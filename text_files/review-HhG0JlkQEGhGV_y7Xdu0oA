It's open late, they've got two drive throughs, and you'll almost always leave with a story. Yeah, I made a cabbie drive me through here once. Designate a driver, kids.  It can be slow, the food is crappy (who doesn't put lettuce and tomato on a burger?!), and you'll likely regret it the following morning, but isn't that what late night food is all about? For $3 I can get a burger and seasoned fries that'll hold me over till morning, and that's priceless.", "business_id": "NqLiTOp3wFxmFPqMa3-DRQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-05", "type": "review"}
