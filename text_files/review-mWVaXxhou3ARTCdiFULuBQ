Today I can safely say I ate a sm\u00f6rgsbord of food for lunch, including shrimp fried rice, mac and cheese, vegetable lo mein, Korean tofu and two onion rings which I dipped in some tikka masala sauce.   All of the food, available as a hot food/salad bar, tasted fresh, and not overly greasy. Neither the noodles nor the rice were overcooked and the cheese on the mac was real. At $6.99/lb, you can grab as much of each savory dish as you want.", "business_id": "vC_JaMwrNzC1Nuu5ITUyCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-30", "type": "review"}
