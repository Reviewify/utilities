I saw a review for Golden Nails on 113th; after being scared away from the interior I went to Carnegie. The interior is really spacious, clean, a bit luxurious but very nice and comfortable as, you're getting a spa service so you want kind of nice. My technician put a lot of time and care into my pedicure and all women who worked there were really sweet. The pedi cost exactly what I thought it would (no sneaky upsell). I would recommend against the $ for a 10 min massage; I've had better.", "business_id": "7wDXPk1DdQ5sqeXEBFSCmw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-21", "type": "review"}
