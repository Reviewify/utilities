Wanted to send a small sweet bouquet to a teacher who works LITERALLY right next door to this Florist. I figured they could throw something sweet together and walk next door as a \"neighborhood courtesy\"... You know.... keeping it \"in the family\".... old town neighborly type of thing... I was blown away when they told me they had a $40 minimum... and then a LARGE ($12+) delivery charge minimum on top of that! I tried to explain I just wanted a little something delicate, cut flowers and pretty greens (no vase) walked next door... something sent as a \"thinking of you\" to my sister (a teacher) with a flower from each of her neices & nephews included... no grand gesture was needed...... It was a total \"no go\" with a crabby and snarky gal on the other line... I'm honestly shocked by their unwillingness to be accommodating and do something for folks right next door in their community.. I was told by the gal...\"Even if we walk our flowers to the office upstairs... we're charging a delivery fee\".... ummm,nice. If I have to pay $52+ to send flowers... I might as well order from someone else who actually is pleasant and has to spend money on gas for the \"delivery\" fee.", "business_id": "Dd40RaQyCWIlGjNsG0wkAA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-28", "type": "review"}
