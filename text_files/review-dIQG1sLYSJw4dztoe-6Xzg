You know.... keeping it \"in the family\".... old town neighborly type of thing...\n\nI was blown away when they told me they had a $40 minimum... and then a LARGE ($12+) delivery charge minimum on top of that!  \n\nI tried to explain I just wanted a little something delicate, cut flowers and pretty greens (no vase) walked next door... something sent as a \"thinking of you\"  to my sister (a teacher) with a flower from each of her neices & nephews included... no grand gesture was needed......  \n\nIt was a total \"no go\" with a crabby and snarky gal on the other line... \n\nI'm honestly shocked by their unwillingness to be accommodating and do something for folks right next door in their community..  I was told by the gal...\"Even if we walk our flowers to the office upstairs... we're charging a delivery fee\".... ummm,nice.\n\nIf I have to pay $52+ to send flowers... I might as well order from someone else who actually is pleasant and has to spend money on gas for the \"delivery\" fee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Dd40RaQyCWIlGjNsG0wkAA"}
