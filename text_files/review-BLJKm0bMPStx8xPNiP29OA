I waited about 10 minutes for them to finish up with a car before me, no biggie.  Then they looked at my car and asked if there was any reason why my brand new registration wouldn't go through, which there wasn't. They tried running it a few times and told me that I would have to call my insurance agent to get it straightened out.  My SRS/airbag light was on and they told me my car would fail inspection because of that and that I should take it to a dealer to get it fixed.  My roommate took her car here earlier in the year to get it inspected and they couldn't get her registration to go through either.  What is going on with this place?? Annoyed at this, I took my car to a Honda shop down the street to see if I could avoid having to spend hundreds at a dealer to fix the light.  They fixed it, no problem, and told me that my car should have passed even with the light on!  They drove my car to a different place to have it inspected and the registration was perfectly good! I don't know what they have going on with how they run registrations, but it is probably something they should straighten out.", "business_id": "7eZ-fK1U5Zok4X4YIUWicg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-01", "type": "review"}
