This burrito-shaped package was loaded and packed with fresh ingredients of your picking. Love places that aren't stingy! \n\nSo think of the assembly order style found at Chipotle. Same deal. Choose between burroti bowl or wrapped burroti? Then you get to choose between brown or white rice, meat, spicy sauces, and vegetables. I thought the Chicken Tikka Burroti had good flavor with tender chunks of chicken. It could use some more tikka masala sauce... And extra cup of tikka masala sauce was free of charge! \n\nThe burroti was enough for two meals since the portion was so large! Definitely would come back for another burroti :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0gE8y94ytFFdFDDNon-K0g"}
