Could it be that I am growing another human being? Maybe. Even without my cravings I love this place. The burgers wonderful! I have had the UCheeseburger several times in the past few weeks and it's perfect. Not too greasy, lots of veggies and to top it off thin sliced onions. The icing on the cake? The fries. . . . need I say more? In fact, I think I better grab the hubs and get some grub! Enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PPQgcw0WKdZ6nznkPLgX5Q"}
