From the service, to the ambiance, even the Chef came out to us during dessert. It is on the expensive side and wine can range from $40 a bottle to $370. Our food was perfectly cooked and we were even given an extra 4th course for free-I've no idea why, we just were. It was a fabulously sophisticated 4 course meal. We both enjoyed it very much!  I would recommend either the roast chicken or Salmon and for dessert indulge in a satisfying light coconut cake.  I will go back here but only for a special occasion. I don't have $200 to spend on a meal that often. They do however have a fixed price, 3 course menu for $40 a person. And they do $1 Oysters on Mondays!! Try it!", "business_id": "uj8u2FWO9JQ5z2ouYADWZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-24", "type": "review"}
