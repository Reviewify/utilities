Gigantic space with loads of tables and chairs for reading/studying. I love the mixture of old and new architecture. It's always busy with families and students, which means it's a well utilized resource. The lawn out front is often full of people reading or chatting or watching their kids play-- feels like a scene out of a rom-com. It's wonderful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I1BThWSQS0-VWvR-1jAmLQ"}
