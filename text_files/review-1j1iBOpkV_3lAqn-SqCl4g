It's simple with fresh, often natural ingredients.  The menu also changes seasonally and incorporates food from local suppliers.  Last time I was there there was cheese from a local farm.  The atmosphere is nice and spacious, and they have a good, attentive waitstaff who are knowledgeable about the menu.  This place is spacious enough for larger groups and also has outdoor seating.  When I go I almost always get the salmon entree, and it is always perfect.  The bread basket is friggen awesome too.  The prices are moderate.  I actually prefer this place to Rialto next door, although Rialto is also good, Henrietta's Table is much less fussy.  It's a great place to go when you don't want to make a major event of your dinner.  I often will grab a bite here and then head upstairs to the Regatta Bar and listen to some jazz.", "business_id": "1iY5q6spBS_DNWyemY829A", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-10", "type": "review"}
