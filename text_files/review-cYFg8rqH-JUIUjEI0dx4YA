In the end I took Trailways. What a revelation! Polite bus driver. Working a/c. Reasonably quiet bus, except for the nonstop sitcom screaming on the crowd control, I mean the TVs. And get this, folks: WORKING WIFI AND OUTLETS. I got actual work done on a Trailways bus. Never happen on the Mega.  And -- I know, it's crazy -- we left and arrived on time.

Forget Mega, use an actual coach company.", "business_id": "X_OnAUXVGHjyWP9zoPVLTA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-25", "type": "review"}
