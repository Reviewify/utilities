We may have had unrealistic expectations walking in, so it is a \"maybe try again\". But, no rush. True: good food (not great, and not as many veggie options as we expected based on reviews), at extremely affordable prices. True: BYOB - picked up a great bottle of Cote du Rhone from Campus Fine Wines on the way over. Be prepared for: Plastic. A lot of plastic. Our food was brought to us in jointed plastic containers, with 2 plastic plates and two sets of pre-wrapped plastic cutlery. Be prepared to: Drink out of Styrofoam. We arrived, there were two tables occupied. Granted, one of them was a larger party, but they had run out of all but one wine glass and a collectible china mug. A mug o' wine. This probably would have been funny had we gone out for a pre-dinner drink, or two or three. However, they are new- supposedly this was the first time they had run out of glasses, but we still got water (after stepping up to the counter to order it) in Styrofoam cups. Be deliberate where you sit! It is not a huge seating area, and some of the decor is really cozy and groovy, but we also had a prime view of the trash bins and brightly lit kitchen from our seats. Based on other's reviews, we were expecting something else. To reiterate: we may go back, but it will probably be for take-out.", "business_id": "8WGDqkmiwlq50SRIcB_X6w", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}
