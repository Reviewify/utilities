I've heard mixed things, but wanted to see for myself.  I ordered off the \"healthier plates\" part of the menu and got the BBQ chicken and rice/salad.  They have the calorie info on the menu, which is good for the health conscious, but after ordering I was confused to find that the \"healthy plates\" had more calories than some of the other ones--WTF??!  I then noticed small writing on the side of the menu, informing me that \"calorie counts are subject to change, except healthier plates, calorie counts only include meat, not rice, salad, etc\".  REALLY?!!?  WHY HAVE CALORIE COUNTS IF THEY'RE COMPLETELY INACCURATE?!?!\n\nThen my food came.  The only positive thing was the soy sauce-vinegrette on the side of my salad was tasty.  My chicken came with TONS of greasy skin--not very \"healthy\", and had tons of fat and cartilage--hardly any actual chicken.  The chicken it did have was nicely seasoned, but there just wasn't enough for over 8$.  \n\nI certainly won't go back.  Not worth the prices at all, and really not satisfying at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BKlN_RDN6vzQQ_bg4n4R6Q"}
