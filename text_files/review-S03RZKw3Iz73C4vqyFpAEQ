The only bad thing is they close at 9ish on sunday but hey, they have to relax to. I had the North Carolina ribs which were very good. Everyone had the fried chicken so Ill try that on my next visit. For the sides, I had the greens and the macaroni and cheese and cornbread. I guess they do deliver but I know you must have at least 2 entrees and Im not sure how far out they deliver. I was very impressed. The ribs were good, not overcooked and all the food was fresh! I highly recommend!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4GYc1Ld8r4rGQJKz_Qp07A"}
