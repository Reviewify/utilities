I've been coming here since I was in college back in the early 90s and I'm just now writing a review.  Of course, there wasn't Yelp back then.  I also don't buy much here even though I think the world of this place.   But that's only because I'm not a collector. If you are a music fan and like collecting old records and CD's, this is the perfect place.  You can find some real treasure here if you look hard enough.  Their vinyl selection is awesome and just seems to be growing.  I even found some old cassette tapes of Adam and The Ants.  Definite plus.  Their selection of used movies isn't that big but what they have is usually pretty good. I picked up Monsters Crash the Pajama Party about two months ago.  They have a small stage in the back of the store and have bands play on occasion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gMddkqvZ-1KJ9EudDWeGaw"}
