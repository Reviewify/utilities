It was sure the best home style iIalian restaruant around. You could get all the best authentic dishes. The quality and service were very consistant until they made the change. I think either old Fred had retired or he sold the place. I have been going to the newly renovated Fred's for couple of years. The food and service have been really hit or miss. A couple of times it was really good. Pasta was al dante, service was good. The other two times were just awful. Pasta was really mushy. That is a big no no for italian food. The service this last time was just terrible. I contemplate never going back. I mourn the loss of a good neighborhood restaurant! :(", "type": "review", "business_id": "L1vjUWTTogiFtDRyBLi95Q"}
