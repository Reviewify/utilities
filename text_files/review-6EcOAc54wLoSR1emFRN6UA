The burger I had was pretty decent and I like the amount of topping choices you have. I think this place was just a wee bit too gimiky for me. My server on one particular instance was increadibly rude to my whole table. If not for the tasty burger I would have given this place a 1 star on service alone.", "business_id": "Z2qMwUhnGt_2pA9uQbS7Uw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-20", "type": "review"}
