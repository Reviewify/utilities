(95% pima cotton 5% spandex) the store manager is really nice and helps you out with clothes and they ship in items every week. a little pricey for college students but i'd say it's worth it! oh. and i love their store decorations. i wanted the dressing room curtains and some of the wooden signs that they have -- ciao bella (in purple!) -- are for sale!", "business_id": "IaCB5WEANpSWQwm5PccW4Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}
