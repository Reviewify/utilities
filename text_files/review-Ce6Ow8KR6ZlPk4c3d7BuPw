The store sign wasn't up yet, but it's easy to spot. I love their array of clothing!  There's really pretty dresses that are around $40 and I found a really nice pair of black pants that are SO incredibly comfortable! (95% Pima Cotton 5% Spandex) The store manager is really nice and helps you out with clothes and they ship in items every week. A little pricey for college students but I'd say it's worth it! OH. And I love their store decorations. I wanted the dressing room curtains and some of the wooden signs that they have -- CIAO BELLA (in purple!) -- are for sale!", "business_id": "IaCB5WEANpSWQwm5PccW4Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}
