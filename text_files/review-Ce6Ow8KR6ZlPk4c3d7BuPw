The store sign wasn't up yet, but it's easy to spot.\n\nI love their array of clothing! \n\nThere's really pretty dresses that are around $40 and I found a really nice pair of black pants that are SO incredibly comfortable! (95% Pima Cotton 5% Spandex)\n\nThe store manager is really nice and helps you out with clothes and they ship in items every week.\n\nA little pricey for college students but I'd say it's worth it!\n\nOH. And I love their store decorations. I wanted the dressing room curtains and some of the wooden signs that they have -- CIAO BELLA (in purple!) -- are for sale!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IaCB5WEANpSWQwm5PccW4Q"}
