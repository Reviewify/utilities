I finally got around to coming here (twice already in the past week) and was sad to discover that they don't have quite the selection of party favours/goodies! The red velvet (always my favourite) that I got was a little disappointing because the bottom of the cupcake was smaller than usual and crumbled way too easily, making it a little difficult to eat. They didn't have the clear boxes for gift-giving at this Trophy either. :( Wallingford is still the better location, but the U Village Trophy is in a slightly more convenient location so I'm glad it's here! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "I1eS83hJ5wIEUYN_m4P0jA"}
