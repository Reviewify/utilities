Casual and easier on the bank account than a similar place on the other side of the river. For instance, a perfectly cooked Wagyu steak for under 30 dollars can be found at Hungry Mother. Does such a thing exist in Boston? If so, please send me a message with the details. The fried onion strings were amazing - delicate and full of flavor. The cream of celery soup was way better than I thought it would be. I simply needed soup and it was the only one on the menu. Cream of celery doesn't sound like it will be knocking any socks off but it certainly did. This one's going on the shortlist of places I'll be making sure to visit at least a few times a year. They also have this great deal going on with the Kendal movie theater around the corner here. If you're planning a dinner and movie night, call and make reservations. They'll pick up your tickets for you and while they're at discount the tickets to the low low price of 6 dollars. Wha-huh? Yes. You read that correctly. 6 dollar movie tickets for the Kendall theater. They're operating on a higher level at Hungry Mother.", "business_id": "DfrvJL-6H5i1nsyL6H6VGg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-08", "type": "review"}
