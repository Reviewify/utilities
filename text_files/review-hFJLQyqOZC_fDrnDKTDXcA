Alas, Geoff the fantastic trivia master moved on and has been replaced with adequate but lesser questioneers. I recommend checking out Conor's for trivia even though its glory days have passed; it's still probably the best trivia game in Ann Arbor. Conor's has a decent selection of beers including Midwest microbrews alongside the standard selections for an Irish pub. My favorite to order is the Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald porter. I've heard the mixed drinks are good here, but I can't recall ever not getting beer. Food is pretty decent for a pub, although nothing special. The Fisherman's Pie was particularly surprising, since it sounds kind of gross, but it was actually lemony and delicious. I usually stick with sandwiches and French fries for a reliably ok meal. Conor's also has a surprisingly good selection of vegetarian items for a bar. As for the bad: It gets crowded and noisy in here, especially on Friday and Saturday nights and during any special event (like St. Patrick's Day). if you're planning to spend a lot of time at Conor's when you know it will be crowded, get there early. Also, service can be spotty at times. I don't come here for work lunches anymore because it always takes longer than I expect and I end up rushing back to the office. If I recall correctly, Conor's also has the most reasonably priced Irish Car Bombs in Ann Arbor, but for some reason my memory is hazy on the price.", "business_id": "Hc3d_UDV7qE30o6WeQBEmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-19", "type": "review"}
