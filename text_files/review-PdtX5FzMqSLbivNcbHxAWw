The menu looked amazing. So while away on business I thought I'd give it a try. Got the Ted Kennedy, burger with cheddar cheese and mushrooms on an onion roll, ordered medium. Got it as take out. Got back to work anticipating a juicy, flavorful burger. Omg, it was way over cooked, almost crispy. Not flavorful at all; not even cheddar cheese. Ok, the staff was Horrible! Capital H! Rude, pushy, irritated if you don't know what's going on; just down right miserable. To give the place the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were having a bad day. But based on my experience I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-05-11", "type": "review"}
