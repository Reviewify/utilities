It's very convenient for West-Campus dwellers (which I was during my undergraduate days) and has absolutely adorable clothes. I think the family who owns this place does such a great job buying for the store and really know the stuff their target market, the future/current/past sorority girls of Austin, will go for. The selection is surprisingly big and they have a lot of small, unique brands as well as common but great brands like Rachel Pally, Black Halo, Primp, French Connection, Free People, Alice + Olivia etc. They also carry Hollywood fashion tape and Hanky Panky panties, both of which I am a fan of. One especially great thing about C. Jane is their jewelry. They carry some unique and/or local brands and most of it is absolutely adorable! This place is super expensive, especially for students! It's not often I make a purchase there unless my mum is in town and decides to treat me. However, it's worth checking out from time to time because they have good sales (I got an adorable Alice+Olivia top for about $90, which I thought was a decent deal for such a cute item. Another sale item was a Rachel Pally ruffly shirt for about $70. So still expensive but you can treat yourself to something cute without completely breaking the bank.) and if nothing else, just to look and be inspired by the beautiful clothes. For sure my favorite place on the drag and one of the more fashion-forward places in the area.", "business_id": "yBYEABQLnhvbjCQ-la7qiw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-27", "type": "review"}
