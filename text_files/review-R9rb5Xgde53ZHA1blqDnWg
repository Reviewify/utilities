The food is still fantastic but the service has been awful! It seems that chatting about their plans for the night is of a much higher priority than completing orders. Very annoying when I'm on my way to work and have to wait for them all to stop flirting so I can get a move on. Several times I've had to interrupt  conversations to point out that they were making my order wrong. \n\nMaybe they have just gotten lazy for the summer.\n\nStep it up Black Sheep! You still get a few stars for the food, but it really sucks to wait ten minutes for a sandwich with three ingredients when it is your only order. I don't really want to stand there listening to you talk about your personal lives. I just want to eat my sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QxuZGiHF3jnatCUmI41FmA"}
