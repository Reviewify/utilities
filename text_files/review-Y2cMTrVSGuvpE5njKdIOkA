I love the lower level bar, ornate mirrors, dim warm lighting, rich wood tables - nice! It had such a good feel to it and the servers were very cool. I was particularly impressed with the volcano mojito that I got. It was so flavorful and the sugar cane stir is a nice touch. Get the goat cheese appetizer with plantain chips - so good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2vUYE4Pjtgw8rjpPg4RMGg"}
