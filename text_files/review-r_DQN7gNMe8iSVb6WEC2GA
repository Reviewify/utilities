Came here last night for dinner while on a first date. My date had heard this place was good, so we checked it out.  We both really enjoyed our dinner. He got the Rodizio and I got the Lobster Tail. I was indecisive on what to get since I wasn't too hungry (I think I was more nervous than anything, really haha).  The Lobster Tail was very tasty, the best I've ever had and the squeezed lemon and butter made it even more mouth watering. Served with a salad on the side, this was the perfect portion of food. Great place to bring a date! I had an awesome time. :)", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-11", "type": "review"}
