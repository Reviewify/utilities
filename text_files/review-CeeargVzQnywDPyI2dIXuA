The prices are high for the quality you get. The biggest problem I have with this store is the founder and owner gives large sums to the REPUBLICAN Party. Ironic b/c the clientele are usually liberals and young folks. I wish more people knew this. They've also had some racist products that i don't support. I hate to admit that if I'm desperate and in a hurry I will go here b/c the locations are convenient for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C2czV03pzn-7zVg_OyAqnQ"}
