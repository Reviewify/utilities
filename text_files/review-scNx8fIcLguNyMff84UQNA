Most things are either the same price or slightly to moderately cheaper than Whole Foods. Decent sales occasionally, better than WF at least. Their bulk section is where things really shine - I love love love being able to buy three tablespoons of honey or 50 cents of lavender instead of a big huge package of whatever it is. They have everything. It's insane. On the flip side, I'd suggest going to Shaw's if you want anything prepackaged or \"unhealthy,\" or if you don't care to pay 3x more for organic which is often the only option. All I wanted was an ice cream sandwich last Thursday and they literally only had ones made with soymilk. Whatever. Great for veg*ns I guess.", "business_id": "MEhrald0OT7whgnhDf-YEw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-05", "type": "review"}
