I heard about this place during the summer, but didn't get a chance to try it until I came back from break from college. Cold winter, holiday lighting on the streets, light drizzle of rain, my friends and I ran into Cinnaholic for a nice little warm dessert.  Welcomed with an amazing smell of sugary sweetness, my girls and I looked at their menu of toppings and frostings. Let me tell you, it was pretty hard to choose from. They had frostings and toppings for 25 cents each, which ranged from all sorts of fruity, nutty, and sweetish.  They operate on an ipad, random fact, which I though was adorable! So here are our creations (comes to about $5 each): Pina colada frosting with strawberries & raspberries. LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED. Cream soda frosting with apples & candy cane. Doesn't really taste like cream soda, and wasn't very frostingy... but very interesting mixture. Candy cane bits were sort of dangerous if you chomp down the rolls... Strawberry frosting with raspberries & graham crackers. Kiddish treat, the graham crackers are more like chunks of cookies though, not the actual crackers. Hazelnut frosting with almonds and raspberries. ALMONDS are such a nice touch! Can't really taste the hazelnut of the hazelnut frosting though. We got our rolls baked fresh, since I guess they ran out or something when we got there, but the warm rolls with the frosting and the fruit was such a perfect sweet blend on a cold day! We devoured ours soo quickly, and they were beautiful to look at too! Before we demolished those suckers. Anyway, I'm actually not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls, but these babies were definitely satisfying and delicious! Go vegans, and go Cinnaholic!", "business_id": "2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-12", "type": "review"}
