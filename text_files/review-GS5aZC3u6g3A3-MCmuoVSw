I found amazing clothes here! Even when the buffalo exchange that's close to me seemed to go downhill I went to this one and found some amazing clothes. I went recently and once again found amazing clothes!!! vintage which I might add was not ridiculously marked up and name brand clothing. I like the prices and whatever I buy from here I keep and wear for a long time. The employees were pretty nice too but it's the prices and uniqueness of the clothing that really got me! Man I loved it here!!! Smells nice too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5SxjVvtoWxU03-we_Ekrkw"}
