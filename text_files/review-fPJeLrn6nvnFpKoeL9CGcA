I've only had sushi here but it's my goto place in College Park for sushi now. The staff is awesome there, they gave my coworker and I a coupon and let us use it repeatedly on our visits. Their menu along with the price is hard to beat, be sure to check this place out if you're a fan of Thai, sushi or Chinese food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7CRceLJfqisO-NfhmKQsFQ"}
