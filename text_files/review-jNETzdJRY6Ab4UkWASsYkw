I always get a bacon burger and it is amazing.  I have never had a burger under or over cooked.  The fries are always good.  I also love their beer menu.  I swear, nothing goes better with a bacon burger than a Scotty Karate Scotch Ale!  I have brought friends, family and girlfriend, with no complaints!  Parking is not an problem with the parking deck right next door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kNtToQSP_Y5U8tznLXuCaw"}
