We really enjoyed the CSI experience, 3 different crimes and your chance to solve them. We saw this same thing set up in Vegas a couple years later and they charge $25!!! This museum is entertaining and informative. We like that they are constantly adding new exhibits and lectures. We've watched a few movies in their IMAX theatre that is nice and intimate. The science fun starts right from the parking lot with the canter lever experience. Also, if you ever have a chance to attend an event in their outdoor, private space- GO! We've been to a couple weddings as well as fundraisers and events I have helped put on there. I really do love this place and thank the county for making it accessible to everyone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y7Ue76bTsCsmqTcITU20TQ"}
