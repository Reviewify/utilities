The bowl of granola in front of me doesn't seem that appealing anymore. My mind wanders to lunchtime. Standing at the coffee machine at work, I suddenly wipe the saliva from my mouth. The flavorful sauce. The perfectly baked crust. This is serious. I know what I need to do. I keep it to myself for a few hours, though.  It's noon and I decide to go public with my intentions. Billy's eating Tuna. He doesn't want to order. Mary's having soup again. Oh Mary. She loves her soup. But what about Jay? Yes! He's been thinking about Beauty's all morning too. It's going to be a good day, after all. I pull up Beauty's website and login. Beauty's makes the ordering experience remarkably easy. Gone are the days of having to scream my order seven times into the phone. I place my order on the computer. Presto! We check off all the toppings we want and then we are done. Simple. And since this is certainly not my first time ordering, I get a discount. Yes, Beauty's rewards repeat customers.  I am addicted to many things. Beauty's pizza is one of those things.", "business_id": "15HG_YyqAPIYpu0ceaSwHw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-23", "type": "review"}
