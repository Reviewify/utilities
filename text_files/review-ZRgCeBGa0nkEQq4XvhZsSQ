A friend took me when I was visiting months ago and when I saw that distintive diner architecture today I stopped looking for the restaurant I was originally searching for and parked my car to go inside. The platters are so delicious! There's nothing more delicious than meat on a stick.... every culture has a kebab of sorts and the middle east is no exception... mmm quail on a stick, mmm resham chicken.... lamb... mighty tasty! Their selection is great and everything I've tried has been fantastic It's really a primo space too inside of a boxcar diner... They've got booths! I love booths!", "business_id": "9OhPfV0C3Q49l5tSre2MuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}
