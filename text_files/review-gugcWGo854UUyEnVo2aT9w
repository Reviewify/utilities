I go to Mu Lan Chinese all the time which is right across the street and never even noticed Strait. Luckily a friend told me about it today so we decided to check it out. Parking was ok seeing as it was Sunday. We parked on 6th street. But as others have stated there is a parking lot directly across from the restaurant where you can pay $3. We walked in and there were only about 3 couples in there. It was really empty. The place has a nice ambiance though. We chose to sit by the window overlooking Juniper street. There were nice plush pillows on the seats and dimly lit candles at the tables. I opted for the fresh lemonade which was 3.50 but boy was it worth every penny. Lets just say it was amazingly \"fresh\"! I ordered the crispy wontons and the thai meatballs. My friend ordered the spicy basil chicken. Lets just say the portions are extremely small. Our initial thought was that we were going to share everything, but after I saw how small the dishes were....I tried to keep my food to myself because I knew I would be hungry still. The wontons were wonderful. I will be going back to get those again. The meatballs were okay nothing too special. The spicy basil chicken was ugh......I didn't like it at all. I'd rather go to Spoons anyday. I think the place is overrated and way overpriced! I will go back however and sit at the bar, have a few drinks, and eat some crispy shrimp wontons.
