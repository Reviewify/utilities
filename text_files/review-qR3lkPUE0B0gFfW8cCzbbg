Today, I found myself in Jose Bernstein and I ordered the Galbi bowl (for less than $6).  The bowl was filled with this super soft and wet spanish rice, with salsa fresca, lettuce, and topped with boneless galbi.  It also came with fresh tortilla chips.  \n\nIt's pretty warm indoors; there is also outdoor seating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Jb7TuFTJJuyde5IIJHUa5A"}
