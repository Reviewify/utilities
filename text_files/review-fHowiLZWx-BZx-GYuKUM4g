Every time I come here, I shed one lone tear for all the young, impressionable MIT students with their suitcase backpacks wheeling forlornly behind them who have never had a chance to experience delicious and cheap Mexican food.   My first semester at MIT was depressing not just because of how little I actually left campus, but also how much I ate Anna's burritos.  I have eaten almost every kind of burrito here as well as the quesadillas, which are kind of strange--really just fried versions of burritos.   Someone told me that people in Boston really think that the Anna's franchise has the best Mexican food in the area, and I cracked up because I thought they were kidding.  Then as I started talking to more people I realized-- holy crap, it's TRUE. If you are judging your food purely based on convenience and you happen to spend all days of your life on the MIT campus, then Anna's is great.  Otherwise, consider leaving the state for Mexican food... or at least Kendall Square, people!  Other parts of Boston exist. I would say the number one plus is that the people that work there are really nice. I bet that they go home and laugh to their families about the food they serve, while they chow down on something home-cooked and delicious.", "business_id": "T6y0fHkARCqE-8CMs5qHFQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-10", "type": "review"}
