Beaner's took over the American Spoon's old spot.  I, for one, would always take mediocre gelato over bad coffee.  The baristas are pleasant enough, but really ought to be taught how to make a latte.  Starbucks outdoes them 1000%, and is only a few feet away.  I'd even take Espresso Royale over Beaner's (ew).  The ambiance suffers because of poor music choice, poor acoustics - you can hear everyone's conversations no matter where you sit - and the counter seating, where you get every cold gust and rush of noise from the theater crowd.    Apparently it's a good napping spot though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UCILwBpGs6a11F9qPKYeQg"}
