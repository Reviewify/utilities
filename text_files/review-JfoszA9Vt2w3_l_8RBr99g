This place has it all!\n\nThe tri-tip sandwich is so delicious!!! I got their 3 piece beef rib meal which comes with beans (or salad) and garlic bread. They gave me 4 large beef ribs which were humongous, and I finished HALF of my meal. They were good, but very fatty. Fries and onion rings are so huge, they should be shared to feed a family. They sure know how to hook it up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w"}
