Talk about huge servings, good prices, and good food. This place has it all! The tri-tip sandwich is so delicious!!! I got their 3 piece beef rib meal which comes with beans (or salad) and garlic bread. They gave me 4 large beef ribs which were humongous, and I finished HALF of my meal. They were good, but very fatty. Fries and onion rings are so huge, they should be shared to feed a family. They sure know how to hook it up!", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-05", "type": "review"}
