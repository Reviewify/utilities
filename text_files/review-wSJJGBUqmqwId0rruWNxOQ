If I want regular coffee with cream and sugar, I head to Dunkin' Donuts. When I moved to Carrboro this summer and wanted to get out of my comfort zone, I tried Open Eye Cafe. Let's just say I didn't make it a default for my coffee trips. Most people have commented on the atmosphere which is nice I guess. But I'm more interested in the coffee itself rather than just the experience as a whole. And I thought the coffee was gross (I just had straight black with sugar). Many may disregard my opinion of the coffee simply because I'm a Starbucks fan and go to Dunkin' Donuts but I've had regular straight black coffee before. I'm not totally deluded with frappacinnos and peppermint mocha lattes. I notice the crowd is mainly students and professors. How do I know this. Practically everyone in there had a laptop. I felt like I was in a New York City starbucks (and I've been to many of those). But aside from my complaints, I know Open Eye Cafe is supportive of the community so kudos for that. But otherwise I won't be returning for coffee.", "business_id": "9JQjoD0Wl1l2OC67Zca8sQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-03", "type": "review"}
