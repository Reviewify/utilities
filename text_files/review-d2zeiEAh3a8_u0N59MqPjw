This place is exactly what I think of when I think of a good cafe.  They seriously got it right...what appeals to me most when I go to cafe is 60% atmosphere, 40% coffee taste.  I am a sucka for ambiance and this place was just perfect.  We sat outside on the deck and shared our lattes.   Another great thing about this cafe is the barista's are so incredibly personable.  We were worried about getting lattes and being all caffiened out since we had to get up early in the morning so they did half-caf latte's for us and gave us some pastries for free!  Ok, now I know, you don't have to be a genius to go, \"Oh I'll do half-caf\"  but there was something about the two gentlemen that was wonderful.  I felt as if we were friends...great feeling [especially since I'm an out of towner]     I can't wait to visit it again my next time in town!", "business_id": "otrAgBvYPhpIpTezkxlebQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-04", "type": "review"}
