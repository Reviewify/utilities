Result: FANTASTIC. I love counter type eateries, and this has to be one of the best I've had. Lax service, greasy food, and easy in / easy out. My double cheeseburger was dressed to the nines with romaine lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, onions, ketchup, slaw and jalepeno slices, fries on the side. It was definitely in my top 5 burgers of all time. The atmosphere was everything a greasy spoon / drugstore / famous college hangout should be. It pained me to actually see people send something back (I think it was some kid who didn't want pickles or something) and people ordering tilapia. Come on, who orders fish at this type of place? Ugh. I wish I had carried enough cash to have picked up a milkshake, but I will assuredly go back.", "business_id": "im36Cxg-mcBLyz3pa53n6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-16", "type": "review"}
