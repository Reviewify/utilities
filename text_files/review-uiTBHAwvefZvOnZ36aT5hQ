My first thought walking through the door was that this did not look like a typical strip mall salon.  it was very bright, well decorated, with comfy waiting chairs and a cool trendy vibe.  I also figured this would mean an expensive cut.  I waited less than 5 minutes despite not having an appointment, before Stephanie came and whisked me away to a sink to wash my hair.  She was not extraordinarily chatty (which I care for, I don't want to chit chat, but I know some people do), but she was friendly and professional.  I showed her a photo of what I wanted and she wasn't above telling me that perhaps a few longer layers and shorter bangs would highlight my face better, and then she went to work.  They were not very busy while I was there, only one other person who was directly next to me, the hair dressers preceded to complain about a woman next door, but otherwise I liked the experience.  A wash, cut, and blow dry was $22 and I tipped well.  I will be going back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lz5nqlBp80xVfxc7QJKkfQ"}
