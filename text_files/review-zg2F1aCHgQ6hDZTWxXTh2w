Garden omlette with classic hash browns. 1960's American classic decor with warm wood panels and leather booths and high back chairs in a \"library\" setting. American comfort food, very good. Unassuming, the business has been around since 1950 (their Sunset location), so although they're not very hip, they don't need to be, their food speaks for itself.", "business_id": "Rq4uo4COsP8W-oo1KgTavQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-20", "type": "review"}
