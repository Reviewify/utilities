It really cleared out after that which was nice because I was with my family and wanted to sit and talk. Even when it was crowded and there were two other groups in our small-ish room, it was easy to hear each other. The music was nice, but wasn't blaring like some restaurants like to do. It was a reasonable volume\n\nThe food was delicious. My husband and I both ordered the \"Angry Pasta.\" I forget what the real name is. It was a HUGE portion! It had a nice spiciness to it, not overwhelming though. Topped with lots of fresh basil. VERY nicely done! The garlic bread was good also, very buttery.  I just had the leftovers for lunch, and it was still really good. \n\nThe only thing keeping me from a five star rating is the service. We had a young waitress, I'm sure she was a student at the university and didn't care that much. She just didn't seem to be happy that we were there, only brought 4 appetizer plates for 5 people (finally brought one AFTER the 1st appetizer was done) and she forgot the second appetizer. \n\nI will be going back again next time I have a hankering for some good Italian food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EoPd4SI9-mnkyb2CJcgkLA"}
