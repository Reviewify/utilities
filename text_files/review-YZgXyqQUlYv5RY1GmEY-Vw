But as soon as I was served their Jasmine Milk Green Tea with bubbles, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Their tapioca was the right amount of chewy texture and flavor, not like other bubble tea places where their bubbles were hard and disgusting (ugh). Their milk tea held just the right amount of sweetness which was perfect for me as I am not a big fan of overly sweet drinks. Then I had their Passion Fruit Blizzard with popping boba and that was when I knew that I was a Limered convert for sure. I loved their popping boba and worth every additional cent that I had to pay for it.  The only downside to Limered would be that there isn't one in New York City!", "business_id": "eYzNsTc9BXKIPP7FXx5kjg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-06", "type": "review"}
