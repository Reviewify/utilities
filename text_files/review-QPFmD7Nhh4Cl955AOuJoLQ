Both are great.  \nAnd they DELIVER!  And easy parking!  \nThey said that they've only been at this location a month, and the word hasn't spread yet, so please people, let's not let this neighborhood treasure go the way of the dodo!  Spread the word that delicious, affordable pizza is available!  Right across from PCC in the strip mall next to the Jack-in-the-Box.  They said they do ok when the students are there in the daytime, but at night they need to drum up some more business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zK9RBUix41DfeT6f3j5LGA"}
