The El Metate burrito is so big that it's the size of both of my fists.  If you have the stomach to down their large 40oz horchata and a side order of their delicious shrimp tostadas, then - well - you leave feeling like a cow.\n\nThe best thing is that everything here is cheap.  For all that food, I spent like $12.  \n\nThis is a small, family owned restaurant and the food tastes authentic.  Their carne asada is thin, but really flavorful.  I love their shrimp tostadas, which are only $2.50.  There's a considerable amount of shrimp, it's flavorful, and there's a good citrus flavor. Their horchata is freshly made and I like to get it when I'm here.\n\nKeep an eye out for their daily specials...they have unique items like \"garlic shrimp and scallops\".  Their specials are different every day.  \n\nI love this small, family owned business.  I look forward to coming back to trying more items.  Parking isn't bad.  You can usually find some if  you are willing to walk a few blocks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "p8hQhrMD9Ls4nAdHzGnZzA"}
