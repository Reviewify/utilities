This is the best sushi in Berkeley, and hands down, my favorite place to visit with friends. The rolls are a good deal given their quality and size, but avoid the nigiri; it's too expensive. The wait can be long on weekends, but it's for good reason. The dining rooms are intimate and cozy. I recommend the spicy juicy or rainbow rolls.", "business_id": "RDa29pAaWeZjA9MvAry7Gw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-16", "type": "review"}
