My husband and I stayed here this summer the week before our Ann Arbor wedding.  The Innkeeper was wonderful - Marcia cooked us wonderful breakfasts, and kept the Farmhouse in perfect shape.  My husband and I enjoyed evenings on the wrap-around porch, and peaceful sleep in the quiet house.  There were always snacks and drinks available in the common room, also books, TV, DVDs.  We loved it!  Close enough to downtown that you could walk back and forth if you wanted the exercise - lots of parking at the Inn too. And I could never forget about wonderful, darling Clara!  The Innkeeper has a dog!  Clara is an adorable, young black lab.  I could've played with her all day. The Ann Arbor B&B Farmhouse is a special place.  It's worth the money for the peace and harmony it will bring you during your stay in A2.", "business_id": "PKWR-5u0aCaMXkr7YkJXMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-21", "type": "review"}
