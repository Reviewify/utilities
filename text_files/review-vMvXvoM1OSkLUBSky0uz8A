Keeping it simple, stack of pancakes and coffee, definitely live up to the billing. Moving on to their creative side, WTF Pancakes, Banana Pancakes, DaKine French Toast, Mowie Wowie Omelette(Portugese Sausage and SPAM!), are all out of this world. Plain and simple, hearty and tasty meals. The bummer, parking is atrocious, and the wait can run up to an hour or more. The message, if the parking and wait are reasonable, then definitely worth a visit.", "business_id": "BonZ748EKm8pwtVQalFpYQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-29", "type": "review"}
