But I've been pretty happy the other times I've gone.  I can never remember the dishes that I throw on top of my basmati rice.... it all kind of mixes together into a deliciously homogeneous curry slurry.  Yes that sounds disgusting, but you must realize that I had to do it because it rhymes. I wouldn't say that it's amazing, but sometimes I don't want to pay $15 to get my Indian food fix... and that's where Earthen Jar is able to satisfy me.  I just wish that the dishes were hotter (temperature-wise, not spice...although I guess they could use more heat in those regards as well).", "business_id": "AqyDXaob6pF7zE2s9nFR2w", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-16", "type": "review"}
