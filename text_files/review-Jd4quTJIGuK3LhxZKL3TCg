First one, star off because service was a wee bit slow, however our waiter was very apologetic and gave my boyfriend a free tequila. We ordered the carnitas (Pork tacos), Ceviche and (I forget the name) Shrimp/Chorizo tacos. Holy Christ on a corn tortilla. The Ceviche was perfect with a hint of thai flavor on account of the coconut. The Shrimp tacos had a hint of Indian due to the very small amount of curry and the Carnitas were, well...just cooked perfectly with crunchy pineapple. All very good. We decided to be extra indulgent and ordered the El Fuerte for two...which was Flour less Choc. cake, espresso Ice cream, spicy peanuts, vanilla mousseline and they poured some Patrone Espresso Tequila stuff on it that was nothing short of amazing. They have a good selections of tequila and wines, good beer and they white sangria was pretty awesome. I'd call this more of a modern Mex. restaurant that serves small plates. I could say much more, but I'll save that for next time we go.", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-09", "type": "review"}
