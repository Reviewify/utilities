Waited 35 minutes to get our drinks (two glasses of champagne and a beer - NOT specialty cocktails). Another waiter had to take our order because our waiter was \"too busy\" (in a restaurant that was half full). After I complained to the host (who was anything but apologetic) the service improved only mildly. The food is good but it doesn't make up for the poor service or the poor attitude of the staff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PSL_ln24XidWdTjnXgmkNQ"}
