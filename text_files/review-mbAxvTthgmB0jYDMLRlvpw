I hate to say it, because I wanted to hate this place, but the food was good. My appetizer was a bit greasy (but that's what you get when you melt blue cheese all over a giant mushroom). My main dish, the pork, was pretty much delicious. The biggest disappointment: my side of green veggies was mushy, like they drowned the veggies before serving them. Overall, three stars, though I was hoping - based on icky atmosphere alone - to give it two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1iY5q6spBS_DNWyemY829A"}
