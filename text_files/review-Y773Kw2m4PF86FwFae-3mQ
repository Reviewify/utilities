(yeah, its really a musical, don't adjust your monitor.) i went with a mixed ages crowd- 2 high school kids, my parents -in their seventies-, and myself and the hubby. we all agreed we really like the venue. we had some of the cheapest seats but still had a great view of the stage thanks to the floor design of this intimate venue. we didn't eat but had beverages, reasonably priced soda and a carafe of wine. as for the show- this version of hamlet the musical was almost nothing like the first. this version was way raunchier and in some parts featured frat-house style humor while using most of the original dialog. hubby and i laughed and really liked it. high school kids chuckled, did not understand some of it (they haven't read it yet) but loved the \"battle of the bands\" portion. my parents were so put off by crude sexual humor that they left at intermission.", "business_id": "D6374F90YKRU7qktcXAA7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-21", "type": "review"}
