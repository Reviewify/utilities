Many of the Special Olympic pratices and events are held there, and for good reason. They have a large indoor pool, a nice gym, and a climbing wall, but there are even more attractions on the grounds surrounding the facility. It's there that you'll find the lovely rose garden, some cool public art, volleyball and bocce ball courts, and a kids' playground area. My favorite thing about the Community Center is that it's the starting point for the Bolin Creek Trail, which is like 3 miles long and a great place for a relaxing walk or run. And I had no idea that you couldn't have a picnic in the rose garden, but they do also have some picnic tables.", "business_id": "0rJdV8v9ow3WvPj8dzyffg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-01", "type": "review"}
