I think it's pretty sad that when a restaurant has a majority of black patrons, it has to be referred to as ghetto. Sad. How should I refer to the happy hour locations I patronize that serve majority white patrons??? See my point?  So get a grip people!! \nNow onto my review....I enjoy this Friday's during happy hour. As a matter of fact, I'm on my way there to meet friends this evening. My only concern is there aren't black bartenders. Why is that a concern??? Well, considering they have many black patrons here who leave sizable tips -- why wouldn't they have at least one black bartender to show diversity on their part. As a patron, I would very much like to see a black bartender serving drinks and socializing with the patrons. I have no problems at all with the white bartenders they have -- they actually serve great drinks but it's the principal of the matter for me. Just my thoughts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VtMnUouAvqA6NbrduP4trQ"}
