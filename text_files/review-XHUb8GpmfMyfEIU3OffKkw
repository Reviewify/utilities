For a while I was working out of the Pasadena courthouse and this place was a pretty regular after work stop. Good, price friendly beer, free self-serve barrel of peanuts, and a decent selection of bar eats make this place five stars. The last couple months they have started a trivia night on Sundays and Tuesdays, so if you are looking for a quick drink be careful on those night - the place fills up and stays pretty crowded. T Boyles is also located right behind the Academy discount theatre so it makes for a great place to stop in for a pre or post movie drink. One downside is the sports played on the tvs is a bit repetitive and no allowance made for alternative sporting events. Although they were nice enough to turn one tv to election results on election night.", "business_id": "3ECZI0UqG-DT_qa23SqQ-w", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-11", "type": "review"}
