I had to re-arrange a morning to get to a first of day appointment last week. We were running 10 minutes late but we got a call saying Dr. Adams could not see us. I tried to beg them to reconsider since I took the morning off at work and explained that we're literally almost at their doorstep but without any consideration, they told us that we had to re-schedule. There were plenty of times when the office called us to cancel or re-schedule on the same day because of an emergency on their part but when you're having one of your own, they will not accomdate you. What's worse is the other person on the other line sounded like she didnt give a damn about what we're going through. She asked if I wanted to re-schedule and I told her that I have to call back and look at our schedule and all she said was \"ok?\" and then click. I called back and left a message saying how disappointed I was and if we could get a call back but no one did. Looks to me like this is not only happening to me but to many others as well (see link below). I hope that they can fix their customer service staff or they might end up losing their clients. Ashame because my son was looking forward to seeing Dr. Adams that day :( http://www.insiderpages.com/b/15238473128", "business_id": "RDvLwa52SM2cclImjElSLg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-24", "type": "review"}
