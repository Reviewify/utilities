I recommend their noodle dishes (which they can make vegetarian). Their sushi is also not bad, and more reasonably priced than the Korean run Japanese place across the street. I'm a big fan of their seaweed salad as well. Lastly, I have to say that the standard Korean dishes, especially the jigaes, are decent, but not great.", "business_id": "QSGSWUCRzhoQa-v5dGoD6g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-16", "type": "review"}
