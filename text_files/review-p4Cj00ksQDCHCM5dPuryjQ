The music is top-notch, as are the lovely people who work here. Really high quality selections from various genres, from old Chicago house, classic Detroit Techno, Disco 12 inches, Rhythm and Blues, new experimental music, rock-n-roll, and more. The layout is minimal, with beautiful records on display, and comfortable bins to browse. All-Day also supports local and touring musicians. I've learned about more new and old music from checking out shows, digging in the bins, and asking what's currently playing on the turntables. Great record store, waaaay cool.", "business_id": "SsB7q93G8YHgl1_Mv4ka6A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-30", "type": "review"}
