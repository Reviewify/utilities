However, to be honest, this place is a little overrated. It's a fusion of Japanese and Korean, and most of the nigiri sushi and hand rolls are pretty pricy. A lot of the rolls on the menu are good. I like their bento/lunch specials, the katsu don and bibimbob are really good deals. Sometimes the place could be really crowded because the space is very tight. Try to beat the crowd by going early.", "business_id": "sT76TjIALrtPtUb07_k1AA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}
