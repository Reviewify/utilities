And he is eternally patient.  I have had so much trouble with my contacts over the years, but he keeps trying new lenses on me, even calling me when there are new ones that might work.  We finally got some that are just about perfect, so I'm very happy right now.  I got a couple of pairs of glasses there, too, and they are perfect.  It was hard on my ego to have to get bifocals, but they made the transition incredibly easy.   I really like the staff, as I've grown to know them over my many visits to this location.  They're good people who take good care of their patients.  I recommend Dr. Flanders to all of my friends.", "business_id": "67QgqF4gF2vcBb19W_0Nqw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-19", "type": "review"}
