We went for lunch and although we had a reservation, it was so crowded we had to wait a little - which we didn't mind. The hostess kept apologizing for making us wait and assured us that we'll be seated soon. Once we were seated, the hostess arranged for free round(s) of appetizers for making us wait so we got to try several different plates. Not much of the liver mousse fan, but the cranberry bread was very good.  \nI ordered the cheeseburger and was very pleasantly surprised by it. The homemade ketchup was definitely a plus, and the fries were just the way I like them - crispy. We also ordered cranberry beans & cauliflower as sides. I liked the cauliflower but not so much of the cranberry beans, they were just... beans and nothing special.\nFor dessert they had ice cream sandwiches so we ordered chocolate chip & butter pecan. The Sandwich was thin & crisp (not your typical grocery ice cream sandwich softness) and the ice cream was delicious.\nI would love to try this place out again for dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bcx5R5pI3CLHMoMKD204Sw"}
