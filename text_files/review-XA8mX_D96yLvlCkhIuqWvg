Parking is in the back, there is a structure and they validate so to that end you should be covered. First they start you off with some freshly baked bread which is just awesome, it has a fluffy heaviness to it, add the butter and you have some really great bread (and I'm not a bit bread eater).  Food here is a really problem for me and that is because while they have a lot of other great options, each time I regret not ordering the burger and I am usually back within a couple days to get what I should have.  Again, their food is realyl good all around from what I've had but you get this burger craving.... The food is always consistent, every time I've been here, the burger is bad the same wya.  I get the california burger which comes iwth Avacado and bacon...mmmm...bacon.... and the fries with a side of blue cheese.  The buger is fantastic and has a smoky flavor I just totally dig.  I suspect they bake their own hamburger buns since they make their own bread adn if not, they select the right type because they are really good compliemnts to the burger and soaks up the juciness from the patty.  The rest just tops it off really nicely.   They have a great fresh lemonade too worth trying with your meal.", "business_id": "i4OGo_3rSmgW8ze9AiHB1Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-27", "type": "review"}
