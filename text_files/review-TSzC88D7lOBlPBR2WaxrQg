The salmon I had was a little tough and not as fresh as it should be. The Unagi was surprisingly bland. They only offer one type of generic soy sauce (which is not the low sodium variant) and it did not taste good. Servers were very nice. Prices are on the high side for the quality of fish. Matsuri is better than the close by Zono Sushi, but is nothing special.", "business_id": "RiZqeuLN-3y04yh4c20Y0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-10-07", "type": "review"}
