You just need to be in the business for snagging seats if it's a popular time. Afternoon coffee: With several high top seating and communal style tables, you can with with one or several people over a yummy espresso or a Moroccan mint iced tea. And don't forget to pick up one of their pastries. Every single one I've had has been absolutely delicious. People watching: there's a giant window in the front of the store that they open up when the weather is nice. There's also outdoor seating and a long table in front of that window with seats facing the outside so you can see all the crazies and Harvard yuppies awkwardly running into each other for hours, if you wished!  A meal: You can totally go here for a yummy egg bagel or a tasty sandwhich/salad or a decadent dessert at anytime of the day. It's just a really good place to go if you want a good sandwich or salad for lunch.  All an all, i like this place a lot. It tends to get really busy on the weekends, because there's no place that's comparable  to it in Harvard, but all in all a must try.", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-20", "type": "review"}
