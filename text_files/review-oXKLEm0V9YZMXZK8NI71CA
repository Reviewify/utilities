We stopped in because the smell outside was outstanding. We had two different waiters and both were pretty friendly and attentive. My friend had the guacamole burger and I had the beef tips, plus an appetizer of clam chowder. Every little thing was extremely good, in particular the clam chowder and beef tips.", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-01", "type": "review"}
