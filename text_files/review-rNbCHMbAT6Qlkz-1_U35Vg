Yep I fell for it. The hype on this burger caught my attention. Could it be true, a burger that blows In-&-Out burgers out of the water? Could these 5 guys put my animal style to shame?  My first clue should have been the list of toppings. When a restaurant, any restaurant, starts giving you lots of options it means they haven't mastered the simplicity of a good food item. It's like those restaurants that have a 10 page menu. Everything's pretty mediocre and nothing stands out BUT when a restaurant has a 1 page menu with a small list that's guts!  Ok so I went for the little cheeseburger with bacon, a little steak sauce and grilled onions along with the other list of regular toppings (tomato, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, mustard, etc). To spice it up I tried their cajun fries. Not too shabby.  The verdict: Too pricey for a burger that tastes homemade. The toppings end up making it soggy and squishy. The fries? I'll come back for the fries. All in all an ok burger with good fries just not that good when you end up paying that much.", "business_id": "ihu1SSJqHXEgdSb8qyT3pQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-30", "type": "review"}
