The quality of the coffee is excellent, and they have the most amazing cherry apple walnut bagels. Their other snacks and bottled beverage selection is very good as well, and they also have a great selection of tea. I like that the space is comfortable and pleasant, the staff is friendly, and I have always been able to find a place to sit. I've spent a fair amount of time using the free wifi, which is very much appreciated. The seats by the window are a lovely place to enjoy the scenery and people watch. Highly recommended if you're looking for coffee and wifi near Drexel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZPjokVSTWDyRMWxaW7z_9A"}
