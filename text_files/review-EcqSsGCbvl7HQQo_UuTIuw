Everytime I come in here, I'm instantly transported back to my paternal grandmother's kitchen in Puerto Rico. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Ah, those were the days...\r\n\r\nBut besides my personal nostalgia, the food here is undeniably AWESOME. Get anything off the combo menu (I highly recommend the steak) and you will be full of amazing goodness for days. Izzy and his wife call all of their customers \"primo\" (or \"prima\" for the ladies), which means \"cousin\" in Spanish, because they treat everyone like family. \r\n\r\nEven Fat Joe, who Annie P. pointed out does have an autographed picture with the owners on the wall.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vjx_lLRImGPZCu_B7arMOw"}
