I was in the mood for a salad and the  Chopped Salad ($6.99) hit the spot.  From the Corner Bakery website:  Oven-roasted chicken, crisp applewood smoked bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, tomatoes, and green onions tossed with iceberg and romaine lettuce in our sweet and spicy house vinaigrette.  I normally change the dressing to balsamic vinaigrette.  The salad also comes with a roll.\n\nMy friend had the  Baked French Toast ($5.69) - A sweet morning treat of our cinnamon raisin bread baked in a vanilla French custard and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Served with our homemade vanilla syrup, applewood smoked bacon, and a side of fresh fruit medley.   That dish is also very good.\n\nI like this location because you can sit outside and soak up the sun and people watch.\n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "sx_tne-DYkLyW5wir_c4Ag"}
