Last time I was here, Mimi did a great job - thanks to Jane K's recommendation. 5:45pm Went in without an appointment tonight. I noticed the sign that posted their hours. M-F they close at 8pm. That's good to know! My nails get done in a reasonable fashion. Jessica did an okay job. The polish wasn't very smooth but whatever. I needed to run the rest of my errands tonight before the shops closed. She told me to let my nails dry under the fan for three minutes and then I was good to go.  I asked, \"So I can put my shoes on after only three minutes?\" Jessica: \"Yes. Three minutes.\" Cool! I guess it was a super-fast-drying nail fan? I paid $22 for a spa pedi and a 20% tip...  6:45pm I drove off with the fan on high in my car so that my nails could dry some more. Even though she said only three minutes - just in case, ya know? 7:08pm (yes, I looked at the clock and it said 7:08) I touched my big toe to see if it dried and it left an imprint. FRACK. Well, I had time to stop by again on my way home. I mean, they close at 8pm tonight. That should be plenty of time... 7:27pm CLOSED. What the... What happened to being closed at 8pm Monday through Friday?  Now I have to repaint them. All. Why? I don't have that color they used and I don't have time to go back, a THIRD TIME. Thanks for nothing, Nail Spa. No, F-YOU, Nail Spa! Okay, I REALLY want to give you one measly star but my guilty conscience is telling me to be nice so I will leave two stars.  But still, F-YOU.  .", "business_id": "kRyjgdHgxJiyosHTgXM8Bg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-10", "type": "review"}
