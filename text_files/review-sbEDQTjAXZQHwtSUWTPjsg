Last time I was here, Mimi did a great job - thanks to Jane K's recommendation.\n\n5:45pm\nWent in without an appointment tonight. I noticed the sign that posted their hours. M-F they close at 8pm. That's good to know!\n\nMy nails get done in a reasonable fashion. Jessica did an okay job. The polish wasn't very smooth but whatever. I needed to run the rest of my errands tonight before the shops closed. She told me to let my nails dry under the fan for three minutes and then I was good to go. \n\nI asked, \"So I can put my shoes on after only three minutes?\"\nJessica: \"Yes. Three minutes.\"\n\nCool! I guess it was a super-fast-drying nail fan? I paid $22 for a spa pedi and a 20% tip... \n\n6:45pm\nI drove off with the fan on high in my car so that my nails could dry some more. Even though she said only three minutes - just in case, ya know?\n\n7:08pm (yes, I looked at the clock and it said 7:08)\nI touched my big toe to see if it dried and it left an imprint.\n\nFRACK.\n\nWell, I had time to stop by again on my way home. I mean, they close at 8pm tonight. That should be plenty of time...\n\n7:27pm\nCLOSED.\n\nWhat the... What happened to being closed at 8pm Monday through Friday? \n\nNow I have to repaint them. All. Why? I don't have that color they used and I don't have time to go back, a THIRD TIME.\n\nThanks for nothing, Nail Spa.\n\nNo, F-YOU, Nail Spa!\n\nOkay, I REALLY want to give you one measly star but my guilty conscience is telling me to be nice so I will leave two stars. \n\nBut still, F-YOU.\n\n\n.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kRyjgdHgxJiyosHTgXM8Bg"}
