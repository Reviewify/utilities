I am confused as to why my kafta plate mysteriously took 20 minutes to make. The gentleman said it would be a couple of minutes but this was too long. They served multiple parties that came in and left in under 4 minutes each but for whatever reason, kafta is special. That's the only reason for 3 stars. Food is a 5 - get the shwarma.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YeRXjIzxc9FaK6uyrTBvkQ"}
