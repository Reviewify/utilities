(cast off from om down the way? isn't india like less than point one buddhist?) it was warm and intimate. i only dock a star because the service was slow (saying five minutes and ending up to be 20 and to take orders) and the waiter kept making weird comments pointedly at me. i think next time the man will have to come so we can pda the whole meal through. or hey, what are you doing next week?", "business_id": "XjHwaC53U_xSyAL5-APIVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-30", "type": "review"}
