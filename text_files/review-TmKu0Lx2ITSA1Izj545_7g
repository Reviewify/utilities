Let me summarize the reviews for you: fantastic Indian food (might be best in the city) but questionable buffet. In doing so you'll encounter some unfamiliar, authentic dishes leaving you in the dangerous hands of decision. I myself am paralyzed by this and usually trust myself with a new menu about as much as an angry Eastern European with a grenade (being Czech I can say that). I am happy to say that out of the four of us at dinner, three having never been, choosing dishes to share family style turned out to be a wonderful, mutually beneficial idea as everything was fantastic and unique in its sauce which is often rare in Indian food. We had the fish with coconut curry, okra, lameez chicken tikka and chicken curry (that was two words and started with an M). The garlic naan was cooked damn fine and covered with a blanket of diced cloves. Ambiance was modern Indian, though the Buddha head in the entrance confused me. (Cast off from Om down the way? Isn't India like less than point one Buddhist?) It was warm and intimate. I only dock a star because the service was slow (saying five minutes and ending up to be 20 and to take orders) and the waiter kept making weird comments pointedly at me. I think next time the man will have to come so we can PDA the whole meal through. Or hey, what are you doing next week?", "business_id": "XjHwaC53U_xSyAL5-APIVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-10-30", "type": "review"}
