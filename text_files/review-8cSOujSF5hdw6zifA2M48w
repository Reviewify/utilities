Now, let me say this straight off: This place is not cheap. I figured a scoop would be comparable to a what other places might call a \"small\", priced at $4.25. No. The scoop was not the usual pseudo-small, still-a-lot-of-ice-cream that you might get at J.P. Licks. It was just that. A scoop. \n\nA little heartbroken, I nevertheless grabbed a spoon and sunk it into the sad little scoop. Oh my. It was absolutely orgasmic. Incredibly creamy, rich, and so, so, good. My companion had opted for mango sorbet and repeatedly said that he wished he had gotten ice cream instead. Why you would get sorbet at Toscanini's, I don't even know. When the last bits of ice cream disappeared from my tiny cup, a little part of me died inside as I tossed it into a trash can. \n\nHands down, some of the best ice cream I've ever tried. I'll stick to J.P. Licks for great quality and larger servings(aka cheaper prices) and also becuase Toscanini's is a little bit of a trek for me; but you can bet that I'll be here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "u1Xq93R4LQ2VV2hK8MK5Wg"}
