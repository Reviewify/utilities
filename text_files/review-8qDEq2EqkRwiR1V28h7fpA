Their thing here is small weiners with tons of shit on them. Hey, Albany is a weird pack. Those were about the length of my hand and they make them like a factory in there. The weiners here are uncircumcised and by that I mean they still have their skin on them. That aforementioned skin makes them gently snap, so that's good.    (gayest review ever?) Hangover solution? Maybe. Hunger solution? Maybe. Those fuckers are small, and the only visible deal was 4 dogs and a soda for $3.70. Menus are hard to come by, it probably pays to be a regular to learn the intricacies of what they can manufacture.  Reminds me of coney island lunch in pennsylvania. Not necessarily simple, but the formula is the same - chili dogs made en masse with chopped raw onions. One big difference from the PA brethren is the mustard. Great mustard.", "business_id": "l2sEA8T4kPgJOicXqI8KXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-22", "type": "review"}
