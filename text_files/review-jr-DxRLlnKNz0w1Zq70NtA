I had a free lunch here last week with a visiting professor.  The tuna melt was okay, but at least it was a decent size.  Things do seem oddly on the pricey side.  Definitely nothing too special about this place other than the fact that it wasn't packed during lunchtime in Kendall where there really aren't that many real restaurants open for lunch.... which is probably indicative of the overall quality.\n\nService was also alright I suppose, although it took a lot to get our waters refilled.  Beer was normal priced, food didn't kill me and was just barely better then the place I reviewed before this.  I would note that none of our group were carded either.  Perhaps this is useful info for all you young 'uns out there?", "type": "review", "business_id": "SfWZsocz-eqeYO1YOvkPiw"}
