The chips and salsa were delicious and my sizzling beef fajitas platter came with all the fixings (warm tortillas, lettuce, sour cream, guac, beans, etc).  I was stuffed.  If I remember correctly, it only cost me around 7 bucks before tax.  Sure it wasn't as tasty as Hula Hut or Chuy's, but it wasn't bad either.  I would definitely go again to try out more menu items.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KQ9cAyXge_aYnMZ3DW_-Rg"}
