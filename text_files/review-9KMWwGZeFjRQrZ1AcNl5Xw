I wasn't looking to replace my yoga studio, but needed a second go-to stop to complement it.  Enter Black Lotus Yoga. I've been driving past it for months and have checked the schedule countless times, and finally dropped in to try it out. Drop ins (for almost all classes) are $12, and classes range from 60, 75, and 90 minutes. The class card and membership prices are a great deal as well. Mats, blocks, blankets, and tiny glasses of water are all free. It's a tiny studio with mirrors along the side wall, so you (slash, I) can check your (aka my) form and see how ridiculous or awesome you actually look. I've tried a 60 minute vinayasa class (pretty light and easy), a 60-minute haru class (similarly light and relaxing), and a 90-minute level two vinayasa class (sweat galore and what was I thinking, I can't do a handstand!), each with a different instructor. All were welcoming (one even helped me out with quarters for my parking meter!) and not too preachy in their styles of teaching.  All-in-all, I dig the prana here, and also appreciate the strategic class times; you can do a quick and dirty sixty minute class at noon, which is awesome for me on a day off when I want to knock off my workout early, and there are some conventional evening-hour classes as well. Thanks for being welcoming and accessible, Black Lotus! I'll be back....sometimes :)", "business_id": "PJoeiBixPHjvLdwdK9Y8dA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-29", "type": "review"}
