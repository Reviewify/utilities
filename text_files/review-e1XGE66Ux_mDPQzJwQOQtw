We had a cheese, a pineapple, and a bacone slice. Each worse than the other. It went like this, pineapple sucky, bacon, meh, and cheese, the better of the 3. Go search for pizza elsewhere, unless you want a drink, because that was the best part. Beer available, for a buck. awesome. Doesn't make up for  the crust  burnt, and not in a good way, there not being enough sauce, and some of the slices were missing flavor.  You'll find better places in cambridge.", "business_id": "9-zcdAehWLYVGF3PJTqhIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-07", "type": "review"}
