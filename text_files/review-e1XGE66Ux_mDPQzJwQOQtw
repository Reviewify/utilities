We had a cheese, a pineapple, and a bacone slice. Each worse than the other. It went like this, pineapple sucky, bacon, meh, and cheese, the better of the 3. Go search for pizza elsewhere, unless you want a drink, because that was the best part. Beer available, for a buck. awesome. Doesn't make up for  the crust  burnt, and not in a good way, there not being enough sauce, and some of the slices were missing flavor. \nYou'll find better places in cambridge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9-zcdAehWLYVGF3PJTqhIw"}
