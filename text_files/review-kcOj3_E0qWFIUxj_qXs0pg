The intoxicating smells of BBQ ribs, kettle corn, and fresh fruit and vegetables makes me come back every Thursday night. There's tons of people, massive amounts of food, and live entertainment....and best of all, it's free! My favorites would have to be the roasted corn on the cob, freshly picked strawberries, and anything from McLintock's. It's a wonderful atmosphere for any age. I definitely encourage people to go if they're ever in SLO.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nW230zy-Tnp_DyamfXRg8g"}
