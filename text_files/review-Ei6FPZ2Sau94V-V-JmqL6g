I had heard great things about Patricia Yeo, and was so excited to live so close to her restaurant, so we decided to try it out for a special dinner.  \n\nI could nitpick about a lot of things: decor, service, etc, but the most important thing for me at any restaurant is the food.  I seriously considered giving one star, but decided there were some redeeming qualities:  the drinks are excellent, and the appetizers were solid.  We had the water dumplings and the wontons.  They weren't amazing, but they were pretty good. \n\nThe rest of the menu was extremely confusing.  I am all for Asian fusion - but this ranged from pad thai to hamburger to spaghetti to gnocchi.  We were looking forward to Asian, so we stuck with the pad thai and the duck confit chow fun.  Two of my favorite foods in one dish?  Yes please.  \n\nUnfortunately, nothing was good.  The pad thai started with a nice light flavor, but lacked any depth.  I would much rather have the $8 pad thai from a take out restaurant than this dish at any price, let alone for $22.  I've had better pad thai from a frozen bag. Even worse, though, was the chow fun.  Two words: greasy and bland.  Nothing remotely close to the delicate, complex flavors of a good duck confit or chow fun dish.  Again, I would much prefer almost any chow fun I've had before, especially at $24.  \n\nBasically, if you want Asian food go almost anywhere else.  If you want a good (but pricey drink) with some light appetizers after work, this is a good place to go.  Sadly, we ended up spending well over $100 for a greasy, bland, and uninspiring meal.  Thankfully we had good drinks to wash it all down.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A"}
