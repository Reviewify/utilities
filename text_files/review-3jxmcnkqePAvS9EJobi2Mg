My boyfriend and I got a medium traditional style and a sauce sampler (3 sauces) for the two of us ~$7. Frites: Fried-to-order. Fresh and fluffy and crispy! Lightly sea salted. Smoky Chipotle Aioli: Not too spicy and light. I'm a fan! Curry Mango Chutney: Slightly sweet. It made me want to eat curry. I'm REALLY a fan! Roasted Garlic Honey Mustard: I'm more than convinced that she gave us the wasabi one instead because it tasted ridiculously strong and nothing like honey mustard. I was not a fan, I threw it out. Aside from the little mishap with the honey mustard, I loved everything else. I have a thing for fries but I know have a thing for frites. I'm definitely coming back to try the seasonings and other sauces.", "business_id": "RvbN7Zv_W7zHjDh5F0B8Ag", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-03", "type": "review"}
