Fresh and fluffy and crispy! Lightly sea salted.\nSmoky Chipotle Aioli: Not too spicy and light. I'm a fan!\nCurry Mango Chutney: Slightly sweet. It made me want to eat curry. I'm REALLY a fan!\nRoasted Garlic Honey Mustard: I'm more than convinced that she gave us the wasabi one instead because it tasted ridiculously strong and nothing like honey mustard. I was not a fan, I threw it out.\n\nAside from the little mishap with the honey mustard, I loved everything else. I have a thing for fries but I know have a thing for frites. I'm definitely coming back to try the seasonings and other sauces.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RvbN7Zv_W7zHjDh5F0B8Ag"}
