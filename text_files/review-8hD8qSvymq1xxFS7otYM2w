It looked pretty authentic, with ramen, udon, tempura, chicken teriyaki, katsu, and all those yummy Japanese things. The line was quite long--a sure testament to their quality, right?\n\nWell, after some thought I settled on the seafood (fish) combination, with gyoza and salad. \"Six to seven minutes,\" said the lady.\n\nSo I went to the cashier and paid. Not soon after, they handed me this box. \"Is this mine?\" I asked, \"She said six to seven minutes...\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI look in the box. Was the fish supposed to be breaded? \n\nThe guy next to me is checking his too. He also seems confused. I show the contents of my box to the men at the register. \"Is this fish?\" I ask.\n\n\"Yes, that's the seafood combination.\"\n\nSo off I go, though reticently, and then I find that the contents of the box has dripped all over my shirt and pants, which I must wear to an interview in thirty minutes. Thank goodness I wore dark colors!\n\nI finally get settled down to eat, and lo and behold: there are California Rolls in my box rather than gyoza. That sucks, but oh well.\n\nI take a bite of the fried stuff. It's...some sort of meat. Not fish, not seafood. Breaded fried greasy meat!\n\nAnnoyed, I go back up there. I tell the lady and she gets annoyed too. \"You took the wrong box,\" she tells me.\n\nWell yeah, I wonder why. The workers there can't tell their own fish from meat. I explain my case and she tells me to sit down, they'll give me what I ordered. \n\nAnd they did, and I appreciated that. But it was not a fun time at all, with the mix-up, smelly sauce all over my clothing, and barely making it to my interview in time because I had to wait for them to fix the problem. Plus, the fish tasted kind of rubbery.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X1astFPJeGaHEfiBnbOmIw"}
