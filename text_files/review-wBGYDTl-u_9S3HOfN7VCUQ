I wonder if this restaurant carries out any other sustainable food practices. I know that the green restaurant association works with restaurants to implement for sustainable food choices. \nI've been eating at certified green restaurants and luckily there are some really great restaurants that have taken the step towards becoming environmentally sustainable. \n\nOtherwise, I would definitely recommend this spot for some great food!", "type": "review", "business_id": "x1RMxTftVIjS8HvWf8tpoA"}
