The drinks are alright (my personal gripe is thermos coffee) so I tend to order espresso drinks which I've been very happy with. Also I'm a gluten-free gal, and I appreciate the fact that they carry gluten-free baked goods on occasion. A great place to study, do work, or meet a new friend! And Free Wi-Fi is also a BIG plus!", "business_id": "rO-I1eS_92gzFkclW2ZvNg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-17", "type": "review"}
