Its got a japanese name and serves alot of korean food, but if you order the spicy pork, you'll understand why it doesn't matter (yes yes, I know the serve some japanese food, but mainly its just sushi). Its not amazing, but its really good and its fast and cheap. If you are walking around oakland and want something tasty, this place is second to none!", "business_id": "kkD0tv_e5E6a8kRpLYEcaA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-03-24", "type": "review"}
