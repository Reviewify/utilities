We got the chef's tasting menu, and (possibly) because we are Asian, they decided to give us 8 courses of Asian fusion. I can't say it was bad, but it also wasn't good. Everything just tasted okay. The ingredients were really fresh, but they killed it with muted fake Asian flavors. For $150, I did not leave a satisfied customer (I wrote this on their comment card). So I was wondering why everyone loves Craigie when the food was just okay.\n\nI came back a second time for their Farm Fresh Event. The food was so much better this time around. No sriracha, miso, sesame oil, etc. It was everything you could expect from a farm to table meal, topped off with a delicious dessert. I'd come back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"}
