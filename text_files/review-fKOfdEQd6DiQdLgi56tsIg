I have been to several Indian places in several geographic locations (West Lafayette, St. Louis, Silicon Valley where every other person is Indian, San Francisco) and none of them have been as good as Khana Khazana.  I love this place so much.  I don't know the names of the food ever, and KK is great because everything is labeled and described.  Their naan is fantastic as are all the other dishes.  Go there for the dinner buffet and eat so much you don't need for until the next day.  Enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "_xFNZTcKCcSvSfmpaPpefg"}
