A few of us professed to be foodies, so we formed an ad hoc supper club.  Gracie's was a recommendation from a friend so I cajoled the crew to drive the 45 minutes from Newport for a delectable dining experience.  We were not disappointed.  From the inexpensive custom martinis at the bar through dessert, we were thoroughly impressed.  We all chose the fixe prix menu.  Many delicious, fresh choices.  There were several gifts from the kitchen throughout our meal which made it fun and that much more endearing.  The wine list was extensive and we found a few great bottles of Pinot to please even the inexperienced pallet.  The service was off the charts.  It was a memorable meal.  Highly recommended.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mxn822gLYwJp128pbwu3hg"}
