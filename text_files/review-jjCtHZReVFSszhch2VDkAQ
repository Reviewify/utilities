This place has all the cool music performances, ballets, operas, plays, etc.  There have been really bad things.. and really good things I have seen here.  The best part is that most things are really discounted for students.  So it's so worth it when you can sit in the front of an opera for $9.  If you go to a big city, you have to pay $100+ for those type of seats.\n\nThey have wine nights once a week here.  Terrific!\n\nThey also have a bar/cafe here for intermission.  Well priced drinks..  the food is not so terrific.\n\nA great place to go if you're stuck in central IL looking for something to do.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A_eABcl0LTts73RNo2Np2Q"}
