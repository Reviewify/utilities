Stylist Nick fixed the awful cut I got a Dearenger. He listened & did an amazing job! I really mean, I feel like I have found \"my\" stylist. When people ask, I can say \"oh, my hairdresser is Nick, he does an AMAZING job!\" If you want to know the back story, read my 1 Star (bc 0 stars arn't allowed\" review of the cut I got from Dearenger. Let me tell you, Nick at Young Attitudes did not have much to work with, yet somehow he worked some magic. Below, is the thank-you note I wrote to him, and the salon: Nick, you may remember me as the red head who came in with an awful cut from Dearenger. I was miserable as my hair had been on the losing end of a brutal battle against a pair of scissors. I was forced to hide my shame in ponytails & with hats. Dearenger had taken a good three inches off, and had not left you much to work with. But somehow, you did it, you worked some Rapunzel style magic, and managed to give me an amazing cut. It's been about two weeks now & I still LOVE my cut! The layers are flawless, I can let me hair air dry right out of the shower, & the layers look great with my funky, kinky, waves; or I can blow it out all smooth, and the layers look so polished. My side bangs fall perfectly, and can blend with the rest of my cut, or look great by themselves when I put my hair up. I really really love my cut. I can't thank you enough, I will be back, you can count on that! Thanx so much!", "business_id": "aEaxIo_duFCbbojwhkywAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-19", "type": "review"}
