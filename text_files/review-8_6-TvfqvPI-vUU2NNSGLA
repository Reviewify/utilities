We all left underwhelmed. As it was noted in previous posts, there were a number of exhibits that didn't work. The exhibits weren't too interesting to my husband and I and even my six year old son, who loves science. We usually ask our kids what their favorite part of the trip/activity is and today my son was left with nothing to say about it. We go to a lot of museums and being from back East where world renowned museums are littered everywhere (especially children's museums), this one doesn't even compare. Yes it being free is a bonus, but you do get what you pay for! Personally, we wouldn't mind paying for admission if the exhibits were worth it.", "business_id": "y7Ue76bTsCsmqTcITU20TQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-29", "type": "review"}
