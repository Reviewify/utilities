Great atmosphere - top notch music. Thumbs up to the DJ that was spinning (nice mix of old skool hip hop and techno beats). We danced our a$$ off which is good because we were downing the yummy cocktails (pricey for Boston by average for SF standards). Waitstaff was very attentive - I didn't bother with messing with the bar counter...People were so cool even the wait for bathroom was enjoyable. Definitely recommend!", "business_id": "G4K5wXUe3aZ387yS1Gju7A", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-09-27", "type": "review"}
