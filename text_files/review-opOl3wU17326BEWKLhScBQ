This place has great customer service; they take excellent care of their guests, it's relatively cheap, great location in La Jolla/UTC, has a nice, heated pool and a tiny gym. The rooms range from the one-room (with one large bed, full kitchen, tv and bathroom) to the bigger two-stories-\"rooms\" (with two large beds, 3 tvs, large, full kitchen and two bathrooms). I've stayed in both several times and they are both perfect. What I love about this place is their daily, delicious breakfast and their social, (complimentary) dinners every monday - wednesday. With dinner they serve red and white wine, also they serve the locally brewed \"Rock Bottom\" Ale - not bad at all! I believe parking is $12 per day, and there is no problem finding a spot right outside your door. I highly recommend staying here!", "business_id": "Aib9livKVBnsaQ08qlHjsQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-04", "type": "review"}
