I know that the food isn't done any favors by being served buffet-style, but I always take that into account and lower my expectations accordingly. And even then I'm underwhelmed. I love Thai food--even vegan/vegetarian Thai food (though I am neither, myself). Jhanjay is one of my absolute favorite places to eat. Araya's isn't even close to being in the same league. I find the food at Araya's heavy, greasy, unimaginative and bland (everything needs extra condiments, which they do offer). I think vegetables can shine when well done, but here I've only had veggies that were overdone--overcooked, that is. Also, one of the usual pluses for me to eating a meat-free meal is that I feel better afterwards. But eating here makes me feel the same as when I eat Taco Bell.  It's inexpensive. And though it's tiny, they do get bonus points for having a parking lot. I have a hard time picturing anyone other than broke college students liking this place, so at least the location is perfect for that customer base.", "business_id": "Y7ehe7zpS4zf8SjOltf9sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-25", "type": "review"}
