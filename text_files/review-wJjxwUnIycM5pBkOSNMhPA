It's your average place ... I usually just go all out and get the nachos ... if you get them, be warned that they are gigantic and do yourself a favor and splurge the extra dollar and get real chedder cheese not that nacho sauce cheese!  Everything is pretty average so I tend to stick with the nachos.  It's quick, friendly staff, ample seating inside, salsa bar - bonus for that!!", "business_id": "OgojYmoJK5YbgoMD0LC0tA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-18", "type": "review"}
