In college, I spent a fair amount of time dining at the Charles' restaurants. They are all great including Henrietta's Table and Legal Seafood! The rooms are a bit pricey but very posh and comfy. The lobby is attractive and the elevators entertain you with flat-screen tv's while you travel a few floors. The gym is also great though a run along the famous Charles River right outside the hotel is another super option!", "business_id": "PmnIrliSIYc_0L5fWUhbKA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-20", "type": "review"}
