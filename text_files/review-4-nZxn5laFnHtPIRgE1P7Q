VERY picky. I gave Oakley's a shot years ago, and haven't gone anywhere else since, even though I now live ninety miles away. Yes, nine - zero. I've committed their phone number to memory.\n\nThey've been holding court in Westwood since World War II, and do everything from traditional barbershop stuff to full hair salon blowouts. Clinton, the owner, is my barber. No muss, no fuss, and I laugh a lot when I'm there. \n\nHe's like a bartender, only he has, um, sharp things in his hands. So watch it. I just walked out of there, happy as always, and felt compelled to post a review. Nothing beats a great haircut. I'm glad I found Oakley's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n7uT9vOChSHLGfw_4pGusg"}
