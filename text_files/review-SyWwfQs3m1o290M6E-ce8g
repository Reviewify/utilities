Like a huge book store, with separate stands where they can greet and sign books. Free admission, a great way to check out what's happening in the publishing world.  Speakers in the lecture rooms where you sit auditorium style and listen to panels of 4 people or so. There are mikes set up on each side where people can line up to ask questions.  Lots of teenagers as well, taking notes, etc.  \n\nQuite cramped in the stands, so it's rather difficult to browse.  If you already know what you're going to buy, it works better.  Some of the popular items sold out like the Rough travel guides.  Discounts at some of the booths ranging from 20 to 50% off. Refreshments are rather pricey, the lemon aide was $5 and H20 was $3.50. There are also t-shirts, posters, tote bags for sale. We went by to visit SF yelper Emily D. and she was a delight to chat with.   Parking $8, remember where you parked cause there are over 8 parking structures.  On Sunday, you might luck out and get street parking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ylgSCqDi8Bv2c4w9AonUQg"}
