Unfortunately I tried 2-3 separate times to get on the books before successfully booking an appointment.  They only have person to do nails.\n\nDominick is extremely friendly and makes you happy to support a small business.  My manicurist was very nice and did a meticulous job with my pedicure and for most of my manicure.  The problem was with, unfortunately, the most visible part of the service - the nailpolish.  Her first coats didn't cover the entire nail, so I asked her to fill in those edges.  She obliged, but still didnt manage to cover the nail completely.  I was left with nails that would have looked better if I did them myself.\n\nWhy 3 stars for a crappy paintjob?  She was really nice and aside from the nail color the mani-pedi really were enjoyable.  Plus, even though I was running late (thanks to a freak rainstorm) she didn't rush me and didn't make me feel bad for it.\n\nNote about location:  Ground floor of a large apartment complex.  You have to wind through a bunch of mixed housing complexes to get to it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qMPorQ39PSZXgZKtDmQFjA"}
