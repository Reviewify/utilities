The only reason I went there was because I received a coupon for free office visit and physical exam. When I called to make an appointment, they seemed to be pretty open. I think I now know why. The nurse didn't seem to be very skilled and had to take my dog to the back to get his body temperature. I told them that my dog might had some infection in the ears, although he didn't seem to be shaking his head any more. Then they gave me a quote of $188 including a $40 microscopic test , $36 for ear cleaning, $41 for anti-fungal treatment called Conofite (which you can buy at $14 online) and $23 GlenHaven  (which is an ear cleaner exclusively sold at Banfield). They told me that they need to do the microscopic test in order to tell whether it was caused by bacteria or yeast, and then use different drugs accordingly. When I asked them how different was the drug used for treating bacteria v.s. the drug for treating yeast and what was the effective ingredient in those drugs, the nurse turned to the doctor for help. Then the doctor came in with Remicin (which is also exclusively available at Banfield), which treats both bacteria and yeast. So I ended up paying \"only\" $41 for Remicin, instead of the $188 which included everything. The only good thing I have to say is that the doctor seemed pretty patient even when I questioned their procedures. Still, I will NEVER go back again.", "business_id": "JDC3uKeucRxYoBPsaR3eGw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-12", "type": "review"}
