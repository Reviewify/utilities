The pancakes wasn't fluffy and good. The portion was huge and it filled me up. It wasn't expensive but given the quality of the food it, it was probably why. The waiters weren't attentive and the hostess looked like she didn't even want to be there and it ruined the whole mood of the restaurant. I don't think I want to come back again unless I'm broke and hungry.", "business_id": "hViJhiow-CJVryMoEKxGhQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-23", "type": "review"}
