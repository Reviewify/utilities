So my search began for SD's top LASIK surgery centers. After hours of researching, multiple consultations at a variety of LASIK surgery centers, I went with NVISION. During the initial consultation, Dr. Parikh made the time to come talk to me & answer any questions about the procedure & it's potential complications. Unlike other consultations, I never felt rushed, and from the moment I walked in, I felt very welcome. Being an RN myself, I have very high expectations for good customer service, cleanliness, & professionalism. The staff at NVISION exceeded these expectations. The office & operating room are exceptionally clean, they invite a friend or family member to watch the procedure being done. During the procedure Dr. Parikh & his staff \"walked\" me through what was being done, & what to expect. A definite necessity in easing the anxiety while your eyeballs are being lasered!!! Postop: Everything is as exactly how Dr. Parikh describes....a little sting in the hours following surgery, & feeling as if there is a dirty contact lens in your eye (which as the inflammation goes down, this will improve...) & to be able to see is beyond amazing!! Would I do it again? YES! Would I go through NVISION? YES!! I would recommend Dr. Parikh to anyone considering LASIK. And yes, their office offers a variety of financing options....a definite 5 star worthy laser eye center!! I LOVE my new eyes!!", "business_id": "cXzZBLXWwySNh5uHgIrKhQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}
