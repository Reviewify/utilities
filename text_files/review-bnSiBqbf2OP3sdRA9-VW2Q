Well apparently it's become some new trendy thing to do. If you don't know what Tapas means let me tell  you, it means appetizers, literal translation. Which means your probably going to walk out of here hungry. Very pricy, I think the Cheapest item is $6 up to $13 or $14. And you really need to order about 4 of these per person. So as you can see you can run up the bill in just a short amount of time. I will admit that the food is tasty but the price and hunger after wards completely takes those stars away.  Decor... is very overwhelming pinks and greens and blues everywhere. Love the seating arrangement but other then that it looks like and easter egg exploded in here. Some people might ask why pink, Brief cultural lesson... pink is popular building color in Mexico, rural or urban. What's the point of going out to eat only to leave hungry? Don't bother with tapas unless it's cheap. Which most of them aren't.", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-19", "type": "review"}
