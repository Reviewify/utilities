Why are you serving such shitty stale pita with such awesome hummus?  Why did your baba ghanoush get all weird?  Still tasty, actually, but there didn't seems to be much eggplant in it.  Maybe you did what you did another time, which was to substitute something else for the item that you were out of without mentioning it to me?  \nBackstory: I love the appetizer sampler.  I am addicted to the hummus and falafel.  I'm not a big fan of grape leaves but that's just a thing about me, and these grape leaves could totally be the best ever.  And there is, in theory baba ghanoush.\nStory: But this one time I ordered it and the only things that came out were falafel and hummus.  Which was great for me, except maybe they might have at least mentioned \"we are out of half the things in this menu item.\"  \nHoly Land, you do not have people skills.\nI stopped eating meat awhile back but when I did eat the chicken and lamb kabobs here they were pretty awesome.\nI would probably recommend what I am doing tonight- eating the appetizer sampler and scooping up tons of tasty hummus with fresh vegetables instead of stupid stale pita.  Holy Land your pita is a DISHONOR to your hummus.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fY0Dpw5a3i1CMjMuT2SaDQ"}
