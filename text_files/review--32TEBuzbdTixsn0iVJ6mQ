We go there for a laid-back and fun atmosphere that does not end up costing us a fortune. The only downfall - the crowd and the wait. Sometimes it is outrageous. But I would wait to have the delicious corn and black bean empanadas. As for the margaritas? They are sub-par but you pay for what you get. If you want a fine-dining experience I don't know why you would end up at Border Cafe in the first place.", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-08", "type": "review"}
