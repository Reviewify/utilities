We both ordered the rodizio and side bar. I can't say the side bar really impressed me much... Espestus has a wayy better side bar! this one has a lot of cold foods and the warm stuff wasn't all that great. The service was okay.... at times the meats would come quickly... at other times no one was to be found. Our waiter was very nice and attentive though... He brought desert with a candle since we were celebrating a b-day. The meats were pretty good... I really liked the steak. The turkey wrapped in bacon was a little on the dry side. The lamb was very good and not very gamey tasting. If you're a meat lover, this is def the place to be! I usually love the grilled pineapple, but the pineapple here didn't taste very sweet :( The fried bananas they bring you were good, as well as the polenta & cheese biscuits. I tried not to fill up on these though, to save stomach for all the meat.... yum yum yum! As for the desert, some sorta chocolate desert.... it was A-Ok... i've had better desert elsewhere. Overall, its a great place to go! However, i would def choose espetus any day over pampas if location wasn't an issue. They also had live music playing on this saturday night... and a nice ambiance !", "business_id": "VFslQjSgrw4Mu5_Q1xk1KQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-31", "type": "review"}
