I have come to this after years of socializing, partying all over the counrty and after I make the serious effort to become fabulous- I want to maintain the decorum of said fabulousness for a bit while I partake in drinks and social company. Too much to ask? Sigh. eh well...W Hotel, I remember before the Whiskey Blue was there and the hotel was emerging from its days of yore. It is nice to see things are progressive. \nThe drinks are priced accordingly for a bar of such caliber, the specialty list is creative and has some very nice concoctions listed : Absinthe minded something martini... while not packed it did reach a level of capacity comfortable to entertain my entire party. Good place for birthday drinks and a special night out. I am not a fan of $20 valet so pay up or scour the very few spaces. DJ was good- top 40 mixed with electronica on Saturday night, door service was fine, and yes name dropping is art form....as I danced with my cousin I looked past the door to notice Baron Davis peering into our room. lmao.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YVaA9PgC1DZ3or4aWa90IQ"}
