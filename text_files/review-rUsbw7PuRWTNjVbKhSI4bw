Te surgery was scheduled for 11:10am and I wasn't taken in until after 1pm. The anesthesiologist were awesome. The were going to put a \"block\" on my leg and took the time to find the sciatic nerve. Once in the operating room the doctors offered up some music for me to listen to during the surgery (didn't matter in the long run though). Once out of surgery and I was put in my room is when the star system started to get deductions. Most of the nursing staff were meh at best. You push your call button and either it took them more than 10 minutes to attend to you or they would never come at all. Then, on my second night the \"power washers\" showed up. Power washing the sidewalk at 12am in the morning. WTF?? Hospitals are meant for rest and while I did get minimal rest while here, I made it with 10 hours of sleep when I got home. If you have options on where to go you may want to read other reviews of other hospitals. Stanford is just a name, it doesn't hole up to it's reputation though.", "business_id": "DNCPRbPzJfaPOrMjtbIlqg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-05", "type": "review"}
