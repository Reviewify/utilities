Here is why ... if you take the time and go here on a midweek day, you have the chance of finding what you are looking for and there are real bargains to be had here. Ross is better than the factory outlet concept . Outlets these days, with very few exceptions, only sell stuff that has been made exclusively for that purpose...overstock like in the old days (if ever) is no longer to be found. At Ross however you can still find original designer ware for a fraction of the original price... that why I love it. If you don't observe the midweek rule (and forget the holiday period) it is a nightmare. Lines are long and the best stuff melts away very quickly. I must say however that especially the check out staff is well trained and they know to stay polite and keep their cool... unlike some of the clientele. Parking is in the back and the first two hours are free.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ojbummpklEQbas0mGi4tjw"}
