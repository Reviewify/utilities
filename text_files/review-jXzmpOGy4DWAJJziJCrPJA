Let's see: 1. Not trying too hard to \"be\" a dive bar; 2. Not trying too hard, period, but friendly; 3. Best jukebox in Boston; 4. Music and/or games on TV aren't so loud you can't talk to your friends; 5. Basic pub grub and cheap, too; 6. Good beer selection; 7. That certain \"something\" you can't explain, but it's a good something.\n\nI mean, I can try to explain what the overall feeling is, but only by comparison, and what I mean is, the last time I really sat back with a beer and a burger and thought, \"yeah, this is a good moment\" was at The Big Kahuna burger stand on the strip in Panama City back in the distant early nineties. I had a good-sized hangover, a sunburn and had just finished an argument with the boyfriend and I just wanted to bail the hell out of the weekend. So I sat on one of the three stools at the pine-plank bar in front of the shack that constituted Big Kahuna, drank MGDs for a few hours served by a taciturn biker who looked pretty darn hungover himself, and then, just as the sun started sinking over the Gulf of Mexico, I suddenly thought, \"This is a pretty damn good moment.\" \n\nCharlie's is like that, without the sunburn and with better beer, right about sundown on the weekends. Can't say if the nightlife there is any good, but I probably wouldn't like it considering I'm totally old now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA"}
