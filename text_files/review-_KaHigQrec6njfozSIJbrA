My newest discovery, and yes, it's something as mundane as cheese fries. I knew my prediliction to eat anything that vaguely resembles a future heart attack was going to get me in even more trouble one of these days. OH LORD. The cheese fries. Fries, smothered in cheese. Dip them in mustard and you can come pretty close to a religious experience. And I'm not talking one of those: \"You've sinned WAY too much! To the fiery pits of hell with you!' scary dealios, I'm talking \"You've been so good, Your-Name-Here. It's time you were rewarded. Here's your very own Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie/Johnny Depp copy. Go ahead. Run along! And remember- you're dead! No condoms necessary.\" That sort of thing kind of happens when I eat Flat Pattie's cheese fries. Three stars because that's really the only thing off the menu I get (except for the fries of the non-cheese variety).", "business_id": "_gMudADHrACVPC9rnnmuzg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-07", "type": "review"}
