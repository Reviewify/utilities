I was disappointed. The pork tacos were made sweet with some sort of pineapple concoction, and the tortillas were store-bought. I much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves. On the plus side, this is one of the Mexican restaurants that tends to offer coupons via the mail. When I dined on a Monday night, Fiesta Cafe had a lot of older couples taking advantage of the discount.", "business_id": "_a6jhRFIgOe74U73T5B-Ww", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-11", "type": "review"}
