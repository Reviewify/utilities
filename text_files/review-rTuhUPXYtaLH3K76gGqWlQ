We sat at the bar and ate off the appetizer menu, which was a good way to not spend too much but still enjoy a lovely meal. My friend had the house red, which was great, and we each had a bowl of the truly wonderful seafood chowder. It wasn't as chock-full of fish as I would have liked, but still totally delicious and great on a freezing cold day. Then we split a great Hawaiian pizza (grilled pizza of the day) and an overflowing plateful of sweet-potato fries. \n\nI loved the ambiance, because it was an old-school bar but still with white tablecloths and a general classy atmosphere. Bar staff was very nice, too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mMbrhKD5kE5pLBi76BQbpA"}
