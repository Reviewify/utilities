So when they went under, it was a sad day.  Well hurray, red hot lovers is open again as Ray's Red Hot.  The dog that I had was ok, but i believe they switched hot dog brands which is almost blasphemy.  In addition the proportion and  heavy chop of the onion was really over powering to the rest of the en devour.  I doubt that most of the students in the area won't know the difference, and overall i am glad they are back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3or9a1MgzYNf8UBuY3VoWw"}
