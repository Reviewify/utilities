Mall sushi? \"Will I die after eating it?\" I asked myself. Some of my co-workers ate here regularly so I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. The food is made to order as it should be. The portions are ok. The service, whatever little bit there can be for a sushi joint, is friendly. I just can't get over the fact that I am paying 8 or 9 bucks for a sushi combo considering what I get. I guess it's a good thing they smile when they take your money although it's probably because they know you are getting robbed, and yet continue to be a repeat customer.", "business_id": "b2NFzGVrWnYUyd4uEU2kYQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-28", "type": "review"}
