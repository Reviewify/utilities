I walked in but she was busy, so I came back later that day. Lynn was kind, and friendly. I got dressed with her in the room, and I was going to get eyebrow/brazilian. We started off with my down there. She did it extremely fast, I made the mistake of not taking any pain killers ahead of time, but it was seriously so fast! I got done, and did my eye brows. I was extremely happy that I paid all together $40 (eyebrow, brazilian & tip) I will be going soon, right before my Hawaii trip next week!", "type": "review", "business_id": "3eJ0lkWCj95Xvz5GwFHSNA"}
