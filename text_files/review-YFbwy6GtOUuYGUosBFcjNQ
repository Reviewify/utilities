It was a combo of Pupusas (a traditional Salvadoran dish- looks like pancakes but filled with cheese and pork), pastelito (fried corn flour pocket filled with beef, onion, carrots) and broiled Yucas (broiled potatoes that come with spicy chopped cabbage with chili flakes and tomato). My food came quickly and the portions were not out of control- which I appreciated. I would equate the pupusas to a taco truck taco and the pastelito to the honeycomb football shaped dim sum pork item I love to order :) The potato had a surprising good flavor(maybe I just haven't had a white potato in forever?), and the salad that came with it was well flavored enough and spicy enough to make me hiccup. The pupusas had a great cornmeal taste. I enjoyed my combo items- the homemade factor was evident and the greasiness I expected was not there. It was nice to try Salvadorean food, and to interact with the smiley staff at Guanaco's Tacos Pupuseria. This is a place I would definitely come back to. FYI's~ * You can select broiled or fried for you Yucas (potatoes) * Order at the cash register when you come in * Specials are listed on a whiteboard next to the register * The specials board offers more combo options * They have a vegetarian menu * Get your own silverware and water from a station next to the register * Their menu is on their website * Take-out orders can be called in or ordered on the spot * Their combos are about $7 * A pupusas is about $2 al carte", "business_id": "USoCUrnuGw1mwzVpo_dlmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-28", "type": "review"}
