It's a new hotel and the facilities are great.  The lounge area is large and there are plenty of tables.  Homewood Suites provides free hot and continental breakfast everyday and dinner Monday through Thursday. The fitness room is your standard hotel gym.  There are two treadmills, an elliptical, and weights.  However, the machines are brand new and all have touch-screen capabilities with a built in TV.  Awesome. The rooms are HUGE.  They're bigger than the living room in my apartment!  All have large flat screen TVs.  The showers are walk-in and the closet is decent size.  The kitchenette is stacked with dishes, pitchers, pots, pans, bowls, anything you could need! I HIGHLY recommend Homewood Suites if you are staying in Champaign.", "business_id": "2KyPvxkqIdJsLUjAsZBBhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-04", "type": "review"}
