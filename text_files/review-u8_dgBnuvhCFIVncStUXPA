Yeah, it was an accomplishment to finish the ride (I believe the first time I did the ride it was 26 miles and the second time I did the ride it was only 22 miles.) You get a medal at the end of the ride and people congratulating you for finishing.\n\nBUT....\n\nThis isn't the safest ride. At the site of a slight incline, people would STOP and get off their bike to walk it up (happened to me, i was following someone and when they saw the base of a little hill they braked right in front of me and decided to get off their bike and walk it). Thats fine if they would designate a walking area so that the people that wanted to bike up the hill don't have to keep dodging people that are walking.  I had to pedal with one foot clipped in and the other one clipped out, just in case I had to put my foot down so I don't eat it for going to slow. And watch out for kids. They tend to drift off into other peoples lanes.\n\nBut it was fun rolling through LA. Hearing people cheering for you. Seeing how close you are to finishing.  And go with a group friends. Makes it more fun.\n\nSo if you want to try a marathon, I guess give it a shot. Be ready to wake up at the crack of dawn to get to the meeting area. And also in the beginning be ready to walk for awhile because its taking the people in front of you awhile to get going on their bike.\n\nAnd then when the ride is over go stop by your favorite breakfast joint to grub down on some food.\n\nNote*: oh.. i just read some of the other peoples reviews and it looks like there not doing the ride anymore... whoops", "type": "review", "business_id": "GnGi6zJ-mWbZ2pgcrDjUkQ"}
