Also, They have the nerve to ask us not to use Credit Cards to \"help them keep menu prices down\" because they are paying around $5500 per month in fees. For real? grow up Friendly Toast. This is the real world. \n\nThat being said, the rest of the review below is from my original, review and remains true. ( i do really like this place, i just with it would get its shit together)\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nvery hipster-ish\n\nits cool though. \n\ni'd call the menu \"inspired\"... often for the better. sometimes for the worse. \n\nthey have a great drink selection. \n\nthe ambiance is very retro. \n\nBreakfast orientated, but has meals for all day.\n\nThe \"Waiting area\" outside (where you can drink drinks) would be great if you didn;t have to wait so long...", "type": "review", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A"}
