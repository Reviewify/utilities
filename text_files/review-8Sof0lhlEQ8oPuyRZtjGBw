I keep a running list of my favorite spots in ATL so that when friends and relatives visit me, I know where to take them. Well, Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles is always on my list and when I took a friend here during Labor Day Weekend, I remembered why. Picked her up from the airport at 10:30pm. \"Where can I take her out for dinner this late?\"  Other restaurants ran through my head, but my mind settled on Gladys Knight's.  We pulled up and as usual, there was a line. A long one. My friend, asked \"Is this a club or a restaurant.\" I laughed. \"Just another night at Gladys Knight's! This place is always like this.\" She ordered the Uncle Ron's with candied yams and collard greens and after her first bite of the candied yams, she fell in love with this place!  I ordered the Midnight Train as usual. It was good as usual. One thing I love about this place: the AMBIENCE. Sophisticated dining, reasonable prices, and a cure for late night appetite.", "business_id": "zNqQSYafieEgxB2nZ8yAFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-13", "type": "review"}
