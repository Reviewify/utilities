It's fun to watch, and the end product is even better. My work heels are mostly Cole Haan Nike Airs, so fairly expensive and I love them too much to just toss when the heels wear down. At Franks, he'll replace the heels, polish & shine, and your shoes are as good as new for just $12.  He's quick; I'm actually just watching him finish as I draft this review. \n\nI trust Frank because I brought in a pair of Cole Haan NAs to fix previously.  The padding on the inside of both shoes had thinned out and was providing little support. He replaced at a very reasonable price, and they were comfortable again.\n\nHe's friendly, but be sure to specify what it is you want. Also, he prefers cash.\n\nK, shoes are done; gotta run.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_Ft5XC6ub_s0MIosRICybA"}
