You have to... it's the only good Chinese food in CH. It is certainly not the best, or most authentic Chinese dining experience in the world, but what do you expect from a buffet?  I expect tons of tasty food for a flat rate, a bottomless glass of sweet tea, and a badly translated fortune cookie at the end of my meal.  35 Chinese delivers all of those things, and without any MSG.  And, truly, most of their food IS pretty good.   The best thing I've had here is the green beans with garlic and oil... They have a name, but I can't remember what it is.", "business_id": "6CruOxyuBRnJJx3wRu_oMA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-22", "type": "review"}
