Great location and I am a sucker for those red and white checkered tablecloths...but the food....eh. The pizza was pretty good - kind of doughy so if you like it that way then this is a good choice. Pretty tasty sauce and cheese. The pasta was bad. We got the penne with vodka sauce and the pasta was way overcooked and mushy. Lots for leftovers but I did not want it a second time around. Into the trash it went.", "business_id": "geTFpY84Tp-nVTXflnxtDA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-10", "type": "review"}
