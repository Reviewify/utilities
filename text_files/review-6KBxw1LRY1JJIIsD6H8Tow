I came into the store in the afternoon and caught him leaning over a project., totally out of sorts.   He immediately snapped at me....  he would not be able to give me any time or attention...  he was doing something terribly important and treated my like I was bothering him to even dare to enter the store.   I asked if I could just browse the sample frames and he sort of barked at me.. What was I looking for?  I gave him some information of what I was after and he called out some horrendously high price without really listening.  Clearly, he didn't want to be interrupted.  Not a problem for me.... I will gladly take my business elsewhere.  Once I got over being treated that way I asked my self how The Frame Store in Pasadena could possibly stay open for business with him for an owner.  I really wonder!  It was very disappointing.  It was also sad to see someone in such a sad state of mind.", "business_id": "l7H8VGwc08dsqmgm_k7_gw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-06", "type": "review"}
