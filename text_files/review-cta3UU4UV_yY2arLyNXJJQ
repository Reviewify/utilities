The entree size is ridiculously big but I think it's a better deal for about $2 more than the luncheon size especially if you're going to share with someone else or even between 4 people. My friend and I wanted to have a lighter lunch and she told me about this place having delicious salads. My friend tried the Dianne salad and she really enjoyed that. But we tried the Turkey Tostada Salad... sooooo tasty. Every salad comes with a side of zucchini bread which is pretty perfect. That salad had everything in it; mixed greens, smoked turkey, Jack cheese, pecans, cranberries, bell peppers, tortilla strips and perfectly coated in a buttermilk dressing that didn't weigh down the crunch of the mixed greens. My friend and I shared the entree size because we thought it was gonna be a salad so the portions weren't going to be that big. But we damn sure were wrong. That salad could have fed like 4 people. We also tried the homemade potato chips. Those were so fantastic. It was sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and came with a caramelized onion dip... you can dip that with anything and it'd taste good. We barely made a dent in that salad and we couldn't eat anymore. However, after awhile we were just talking and munching and the salad disappeared. We were ridiculously stuffed but we didn't feel all disgusted with ourselves as if we were eating a very heavy pasta meal or something to that extent. The zucchini bread went perfect with the salad because of the sweet nuttiness and a textural difference. I want to try more salads... yum.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Dh3X5NuzAcFZSSl72a5lWg"}
