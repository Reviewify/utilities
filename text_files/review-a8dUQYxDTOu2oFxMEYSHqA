With the 506 right across the street and the Cradle a bit further down the street, this place is in the perfect spot. The fact that the air conditioning is somehow always set on 39 degrees always helps to sober one up quickly as well. The food is not superb. It's breakfast you could make yourself if you had enough energy to muster enough emotion and/or make anything more sophisticated than toast, but you don't, and so having comfort food is *comforting* (but not on a first date, uggghhh). We now have one in Raleigh, but without any great venues right there on Hillsborough Street, I'm thinking I will never be in there - I will need no 'cleanup crew' in my tummy to do damage control, a) and b) it's just not the same. There can only be one with things such as these.", "business_id": "Q0t7EEaygJ2hb4uFn79owQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-23", "type": "review"}
