That being said, it's a \"snuggery.\" The petite space is meant to be cozy and personal, not big and anonymous. Still, I wish there was just one more room for seating. \n\nThat aside, I am a devotee. I was introduced to the Duck and Bunny at a Brown event and was amazed by their mini cupcakes (and freaking adorable name and logo). The cupcakes are not necessarily super moist like the kind you make from a box. They are dense and their texture is more like a madeleine than a pound cake. Still, they are utterly delicious and flavors in the frosting and crumb are in perfect harmony. \n\nThe first interlude was wonderfully tasty so I sought out the restaurant itself. Then, I tried a crepe. A Sweet Baby James crepe. And it was at that point that I knew I had found my new favorite eatery. My boyfriend had the Thomas Henry, which was equally mouth-watering. We got cupcakes \"to go\" but it was all a ruse because we ate them the moment we got back to our place.\n\nThe waitstaff is friendly if a bit on the slow side. Though I have to say that this is a place one comes to relax and enjoy food, not someplace to zoom in and out of. \n\nCan't say enough about the Duck and Bunny. Go and you won't be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BbkF6j51IbcX-ed1f-bnhA"}
