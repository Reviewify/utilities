Delivery can be a bit slow, but always reliable in terms of when they get there. Can't speak to the ambiance of the establishment, but it is good for food moderately quickly when you can use it. Eat too much though and you'll find yourself packing on the pounds. Best dish is likely the herb grilled half chicken. For those of us with ulcerative colitis, not much love as most things are oily, buttery, and cheesy (at the least the best stuff). Definitely no good for a flare, but if you are doing well and tempted to cheat a little, the food here might be worth a try (with the caveats stated above).", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-11", "type": "review"}
