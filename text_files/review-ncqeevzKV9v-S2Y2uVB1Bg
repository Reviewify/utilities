Sure, they have some good deals, but a lot of the stuff is crap.  I don't want to put together my own furniture and I don't want a card board couch. \n\nI do like other things that aren't so major here though, they have great picture frames, and vases.  And the prices are definately cheaper than even walmart, so thats a plus.  \n\nTry the restaurant, the swedish meatballs are where its at.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eKSSsmq0JKOtxYHcCEeGAg"}
