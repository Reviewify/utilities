In fact, they've been nothing but nice and attentive to me in our three year relationship.   That said, Austin rental management companies are uniformly terrible.  512 Realty gets such a high rating from me, in part, because I've dealt with so much worse.  Were I still in Minneapolis, 512 Realty would be nothing special, but in Austin, they have been the most competent, organized, friendly, and professional that I've found. In response to the most frequent complaint I see about them: yes, they fix places up and charge more for them.  My rent has gone up, well, a lot, but I'm still happy.  My apartment is nicer, more energy efficient, and literally brighter than when I began renting here.  I'm also fairly rational and fully expect to be charged the most the market will bear, and would do the same were the positions reversed. Just wanted to throw it out there that you could do a lot worse, and probably not any better, when renting in Austin.", "business_id": "xlmzPf9acjPeRB0FWcjOeA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-20", "type": "review"}
