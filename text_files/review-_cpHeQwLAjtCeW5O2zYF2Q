There's nothing truly special about this place, but I can say that the beer (micro brews) is pretty darn good, so if you're looking for just a few drinks, Johnny H's is a good bet. The space is pretty nice and very spacious, so you should be able to get a table fairly easily. It's below ground though, so forget about sitting near a window. I've had quite a lot of the menu items, and none of them are really \"fantastic.\" But some options, like the burgers, are pretty good. If you want bar food and good beer, and don't want to deal with waiting for a table at your other options in Harvard Square, this is a good place to go. But you can find better food elsewhere.", "business_id": "N7Crq3DytuvUQ2OyX2YRmQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-09", "type": "review"}
