It should be ZERO stars!  I needed a fairly short ride today, not feeling well and no car, and first the driver didn't want to take me (1 p.m. Harvard Square area).  When I said fine I'd find another cab he literally yelled at me that there were no other cabs and started to argue with me about not using him.  I should have walked away, but was so exhausted I just said, fine then you can take me.  I gave him the address and he took off.  After a block he still hadn't put on his meter.  I pointed it out and he refused to put it on.  I said ok, I'll pay you what I usually pay.  When we got to the destination and I handed him the usual fare he tried to start a fight with me about the amount and spoke in an extremely hostile way.  At that point I jumped out of the cab fearing that the man was becoming unhinged.  The situation felt unsafe.   This is not the first time I have had really unpleasant experiences with this cab company.  It is the last time I will ever get in one of their cabs.", "business_id": "hg3C2yOthDRgAKYivJ-QyA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-22", "type": "review"}
