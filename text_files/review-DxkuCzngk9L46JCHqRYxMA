The first time we moved in, they said we'd get one apartment which was facing the pool and had a very nice view, but once we signed the lease and moving day came, they said they switched us to another one with the view of the parking garage.  For some foolish reason we decided to stay and upgrade to a bigger apartment.  When we did this, we got an apartment that had paint all over the carpet, damaged walls, leaky windows, and a huge water stain near the back door.  It took them nearly 6 months to come clean the carpets after several requests.  The windows are still leaking and I requested several times for them to come paint the damaged walls, but finally getting fed up, I asked for them to provide the paint and just did it myself.  The final straw was when the woman in the office began arguing with me because I pointed out she parked in the handicapped spot in the front when she is clearly not handicapped, has no placard in her car, nor a mark on her license plate.  She claimed it is ok because it is private property.  I'll be moving out at the end of my lease for sure this time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Dsh3cDaMV3yslzxHIpUn3g"}
