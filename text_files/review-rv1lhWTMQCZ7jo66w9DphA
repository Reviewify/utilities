Not being a fan of anything bologna I opted out  of the Mortadella  and doubled the Speck and had a sandwich that was a bit smokey and a little salty at the same time , will have it again . The Menzo ,  Medium rare Roast Beef , Asiago cheese , Arugula and Horseradish cream , added extra meat .  All of the flavors just worked well together , you get to taste a little bit of everything at different times , your taste buds won't loose interest in this.    Since the sandwiches have about three pieces of meat in them go ahead and add extra meat (s) to any of the sandwiches for an extra  .75 cents will be worth it . The staff is warm , friendly and informative .", "business_id": "1kHV-hdQXDLeyRyrxn4p7g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-19", "type": "review"}
