It's a little bistro tucked away behind tons of office and research buildings  along the canyon just north of Genessee.  Most people who come here work in the vicinity, and the opening hours are pretty limited.   The food is very delicious and unique.  The variety is good, and the choices are moderately healthy.  The paninis are to die for!  Seating indoor is very chic, and seating outdoor feels nice and fresh, overlooking the canyon. If you're nearby, try this out for lunch! It's a \"cafeteria\" crossed with a fancy restaurant :).", "business_id": "NkGTHDiF_boBdFFaasNndg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-27", "type": "review"}
