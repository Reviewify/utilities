Every one of them have been amazing! The new location is AMAZING! Definitely a good move for them. I like how they are all very Austin -- it adds to the experience. \n\nMy only complaint is the pricing. I think their haircuts are fairly priced (varies by stylist), but to get any color seems a bit on the high side to me. The last time I had a full work-up it was over $400 with tip. Granted, not everyone is necessarily like that, but with this stylist, I think she up-sold me during the process. \n\nI've since switched stylists to Madelyn and she is definitely the best I've seen there!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rLJp8JAWaE4Jx04hdJzEhQ"}
