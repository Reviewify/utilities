This led me to start calling around. Based on Yelp reviews I called Randy. I wanted to see if the reviews were hype or not. I could tell from the questions he asked and how he handled himself that he backed them up! Randy asked me questions to scope the house and quoted me a rate and told me availability. He said if he couldn't get me scheduled he would refer me to someone else who could. Thankfully the seller was able to be available when Randy was so we booked it. When it comes to the inspection, the saying \"you don't know what you don't know\" truly applied to me. I don't know **** about home inspections. Randy took 3-4 hours to do the inspection and educate me about his findings as he went along. He told me about conditions to be aware of and preventative measures to take for protecting me new home (i.e. getting wooden steps away from moist, dark area that touches the ground, to avoid termite stuff) Pretty basic I guess but he completed the job at 5pm on Tuesday and I had a detailed report (including photos) the following morning at 9am. Very thorough and responsive.", "business_id": "OOwa5BDRUHGx6d3LwaJeyg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-14", "type": "review"}
