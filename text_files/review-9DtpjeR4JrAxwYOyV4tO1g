Forget Prince Cafe and go next door.  Mosaic is much cleaner, has nicer and friendlier service, and better food.  I highly recommend the Kifta Kebab Wrap.  You can shisha while watching middle eastern music videos.  Warning - they do not serve tap water for some reason and will charge you for bottle water!", "type": "review", "business_id": "eaa6cqFPfh5n8RV9k7RhYw"}
