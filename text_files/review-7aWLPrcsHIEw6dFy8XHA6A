Having worked at an outfitter back East and I grew really, really familiar with their product line; everything from hats, underwear, fleece, shells, you name it. I've been impressed with their innovation and user-centric product designs and of all the outdoor companies that exist in today's outdoor market, Patagonia seems to have the formula for staying-power. This store, located JUST off the Caltrain station at Palo Alto is convenient, well-stocked, and staffed by friendly folks who love the company. Can't ask for anything better than that.", "business_id": "MHC32AfdABa8Hk31i7ftRQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-02-17", "type": "review"}
