I've been impressed with their innovation and user-centric product designs and of all the outdoor companies that exist in today's outdoor market, Patagonia seems to have the formula for staying-power.\n\nThis store, located JUST off the Caltrain station at Palo Alto is convenient, well-stocked, and staffed by friendly folks who love the company. Can't ask for anything better than that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MHC32AfdABa8Hk31i7ftRQ"}
