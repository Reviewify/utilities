This place is only called burger continental because the owners thought that burgers and fries are what people in America wanted to eat. Then they decided to add the authentic cuisine that they know how to make best, being that they are of middle eastern decent. Order a greek pizza or some kebabs or the chicken constantinople. The hummus and tabouleh are to die for. DON'T order a burger or onion rings!", "business_id": "5rTrfWtd1Isl0v8OK_iiCw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-22", "type": "review"}
