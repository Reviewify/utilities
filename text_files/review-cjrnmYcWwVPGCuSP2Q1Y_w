The sandwiches seem small (to guys. To me, they even appear to be on the larger side!) but are hearty thanks to the grainy pitas. The fillings are always fresh, balancing so adeptly the fine line of healthy vs. scrumptious! Really creative compositions that round out all the flavors so perfectly. \n\nI've been looking for good falafels in Boston and so far, Clover's and Oleana's meet the bar. The seasonal special - the most recent was the Sweet potato - is always innovative and so, so good at the same time. I have always gotten great input from those that work here, too! Everyone definitely takes pride in working here and it's pleasant to talk to those that work the truck. \n\nI've had the rosemary fries once, and they were a bit soggy and too salty. I think it's just due to having to take fries away in a paper bag, building up moisture. I would stick to the sandwiches...\n\nAll in all, an absolute recommend over even some of the good sit-down places around Kendall-Central. Thumbs up!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yvxE2zQ3xwoREosD_n7v_w"}
