There are thinly sliced, curled pieces of meat to choose from which is quite clever; the curled pieces of frozen meat take up space in your bowl. There are an assortment of veggies and the noodles are last. You then place your bowl on a shelf from right to left and there's even a note on the window stating something along the lines of, \"Use the sauces on top of your bowl to help differentiate your bowl from the others.\"\n\nIt was astonishing how some people managed to defy gravity with their 6-7\" tall bowls piled high with a heap of noodles. No shame! There were greasy noodles and veggies all over the floor. If a couple noodles tip over from your bowl that's waiting on the shelf, the cook will scrape it off the shelf and add it to your bowl when grilling.\n\nThis shop is more ghetto than a street food vendor in Asia. The food is pretty tasty though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UeJjjmceSAJLvMingsA65A"}
