I am a fan of Sprinkles no matter what, so I'm just happy they are closer than LA. I do think the Beverly Hills location are better overall though. This location loses a star because of the funky ordering situation. You order when you walk in the door and then wait in another line while they pack it up and ring you up. Can't they just pack it while I tell them what I want, ring me up and get me out the door? It can take an additional 5 to 10 minutes waiting. They need to revisit the ordering and checkout flow.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-21", "type": "review"}
