I can hold down almost an entire wine bottle so 3 mojitos did it for me. Maybe 2! ;) Food is ok. Menu is seasonal. It was March 2012....Had the following: Italian sashimi: Sushi grade tuna and Dayboat scallops with arugula, castelvetrano olives & fired capers $12 : Great balance, the arugula was bitter but I think it worked well with saltier capers and sushi type meal. Not a refreshing bit, but not overpowering either. Good start for our pizza. Butchers Pizza (tomato sauce/fresh mozzarella/finocchio/tesa/ italian sausage/pickled red onion) $16 : Very wet, moist. good though. Had to use utensils for it. I am a hands on gal but i just could not eat with dripping fingers. Pizza not bad but certainly not your \"man\" pizza. needed more meat i think. Dessert was chocolate cake. Rich, a bit dry, but thank goodness for pomegranate crunch. Total about $35 a person. Came with another person. Bad thing is it is very loud and space is very tight in seating area. I can hear conversation of another table. Not too good. It was great i had company who could talk so I did not spend time eavesdropping out of boredom. But then again, you could do that if you had a boring date and can then have something to talk about.", "business_id": "02A7EMn1GbOtsX3w8NwTAA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-24", "type": "review"}
