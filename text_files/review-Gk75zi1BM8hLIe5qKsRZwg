The place is filthy! I saw a cook put his fingers in a pot and lick them. The walls are grimy. Pipes comig out everywhere. The carpet hasnt been cleaned ever I presume! The buffet looks downright scary. chicken tikki-ok taste curry- watery, tasteless, like tomato soup. This is not curry folks. naan- too thick, but ok spinach and potato- too much salt, but tasty Service- 35 minutes to get served. We were the only people in there!! I am wating for my food-borne illness tonight. Someone should call the health dept on this place.", "business_id": "xtyK6kDA4A2ASCVuU2vH7A", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-22", "type": "review"}
