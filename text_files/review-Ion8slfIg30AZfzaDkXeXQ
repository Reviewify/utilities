I had the beef ramen and it was good, although I wished there were more food! The service was friendly, but the service wasnt fast. I came here on a thursday night and it was pretty busy. If you eat inside the place, goodluck because it is very tiny with limited seats and room. Also had the potstickers, which were awesome", "type": "review", "business_id": "9N684D-RFrQC0V4K0XvdxQ"}
