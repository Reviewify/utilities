Perhaps it is due to the dearth of diner style eateries in the Westwood area; the only other establishment in the vicinity in the same genre that comes immediately to mind is Denny's, so there is not much in the way of competition.  \n\nHowever, I wasn't very impressed by the quality of the food.  Is it greasy?  Sure, I guess.  It didn't have much flavor though.  The service was fine, the food was cheap, but come on Headlines, where's the heart?  \n\nI'd call it a paint by numbers diner experience at best.  It certainly won't be making any 'headlines' in my book.  hahahahahahahaha!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4NNPmINhJ5D8S40Uj0vLgg"}
