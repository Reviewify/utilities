Place was packed. Everyone was drinking a margarita with a beer in it. Hmmm...what is this? So..of course I had to try one! It was really good. We all had some queso which was some of the best we have had. I had two fish tacos which were a little different than I am used to but very tasty! They have some sort of garlic sauce on them and then topped with feta cheese and cilantro. Lots of flavor! But if you are not used to 'Baja' style tacos they can be a little different. But at $1.99 a taco how can you beat that! The place is a lot of fun especially for groups wanting to hang out and chill! We will definitely be back! :)", "business_id": "-nztOncReLy3VlGoecvLBA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-20", "type": "review"}
