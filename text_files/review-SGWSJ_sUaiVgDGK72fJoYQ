All of us agreed that they just aren't that great. Out of all of them, we did agree the sugar cookies were best, but I just can't bring myself to say that I love or even really like them all that much. I am, however, glad that they are loved as much as they are due to them being a locally owned business. (I am all for supporting local businesses and want the \"Mom and Pop\" shops to thrive in this day and age. I wish them continued success!", "business_id": "IM15oB7zInJytQk2BfKRrg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-07", "type": "review"}
