Which is +1 star. Otherwise, I think this place is just mediocre-average and while I do wish this 3rd restaurant in this venue the best, I am doubtful of how long it'll actually last. Ordered the Pita Souvlaki (4.50) because I thought this was the meal that came with salad and fries (but turns out that is the combo deal, which is 6.99). The Pita Souvlaki is actually just the sandwich with pita, large pieces of meat, some fries, and their sauce. I had to ask the person behind the counter for the salad+ fries which they gave to me on the house because I was obviously confused. The sandwich itself was okay - it helps that I was really hungry. The meat was good, but kind of dry and chewy. The fries were just okay too - there were just about 2-3 of them in the pita (which was also semi-dry.) I think the best part of their food is THE SAUCE!! Even the owner came up to our table and was talking about how the sauce is special because it's a handmade sauce made by his son. I feel bad because of their nice service, but I don't know if I'd come back. I feel like though it isn't very expensive or anything, you can get more for 6.99 (if you want the meal) elsewhere, but not necessarily near Asian Ghetto which averages at ~8. I think this is definitely a place to try once though.", "business_id": "mU17Eeit-6smjUsKBVUpFw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-16", "type": "review"}
