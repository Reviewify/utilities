The seating against the balcony was a perfect spot to view the cross streets and all the foot traffic that was there. The beer selections were very good and they had a few funny named hard alcohol drinks that were quite tasty as well. Combine the two of these things on a warm spring evening and it turned out perfect.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this place to anybody looking to sit around for a few hours and have some drinks with friends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "56USR7ZY3Gsm4lR42yMQSg"}
