There are 18 holes, each hole has three seperate tee boxes to provide a challenge for almost any skill level.  While none of the holes are impossible, several are tricky and will test your skills. There are quite a few trees scattered throughout the course to provide some entertainment.\n\nIf you'd like to play, check out www.pdga.com for more info.  To purchase discs (a set will run less than $50, the only investment you'll ever need to make to play disc golf), try the REI in College Park or the airport museum next door to the course.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EBHAwBc55TaGkeqWqpugcw"}
