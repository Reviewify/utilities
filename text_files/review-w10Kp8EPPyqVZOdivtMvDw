Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try the coffee because I was already way over-caffeinated by the time I reached Harlem. My friend safari had started downtown in the morning at an unhealthy hour.\n\nI love the giant, solid table that sits in the middle of the room and the huge windows that let as much natural light into the store as possible. Even on an overcast day, the light illuminated the room beautifully. There are sofas and other seemingly soft furnishings by the windows. The bathroom was a bit tricky to navigate--there are no lights. I fiddled with the switch for a good 20 seconds before giving up and relying on the romantic candlelight.\n\nThe desserts were quite delicious. The pumpkin cheesecake and fresh fruit crepe were scrumptious. I'd love to come back here to just sit and read or to have a bit of afternoon tea/coffee with friends. The openness of this coffee-shop just makes it conducive to conversation or studying esoteric Latin vocabulary as Sienna K. enjoys. lol.\n\nI think I like the ban on computers from 11am-4pm...sometimes there's nothing more irritating than the clickety-clack of a keyboard emanating from a laptop when one is trying to read a book or have a conversation. I know...even those precious, immaculate Macbooks make noise...it's hard to believe.\n\n4-STARS: The staff was a bit flakey...Sienna K. and I both ordered pots of tea, however we only received cups.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fFsEJQB2HhpfXV48ioxzXw"}
