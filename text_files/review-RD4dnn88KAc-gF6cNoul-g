This is my first ever negative visible posting. I have purchased thousands of dollars on luggage, briefs, messenger bags, laptop bags, wallets, & pens. My most recent purchase was a $50 pen. Pretty simple, but I love these Cross pens. There was a defect in the pen maybe 2 or 3 months after I purchased it and I went in to get it exchanged or fixed. Long story short they were useless and I had to mail in the pen, pay for shipping, and wait two months to receive my pen back... The pen came back broken (ink leaked during shipping). I was hoping this would be easier the second time around. Not only will they not help me, they keep saying the owner needs to make these decisions, yet they are unavailable during operating hours... Every time I was trying to explain what happened, Duc would interrupt me (not good customer service.).. He eventually hung up on me even though I was not yelling. He just wouldn't listen and said he didn't have authority. If a company doesn't have someone with authority to make an exchange, that company shouldn't be open for business. I will go out of my way to ensure nobody I know ever shops here again. Just awful customer service.", "business_id": "6pMyHRKEqBuyL6jnZLt3gQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-09", "type": "review"}
