An extensive list of beers from Europe, Africa and North America paired with an even more delicious food menu. The guacamole for starters and Kebab in peanut sauce are delicious. Also be sure to try the Tusker beer from Kenya and of course the HB lager in a Ma\u00df or a Stein (it's 1L) Happy drinking!! PS on Fridays and weekends be sure to get there early to get a seat!", "business_id": "Fk495HaokZDrGkAG8s_dlg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-18", "type": "review"}
