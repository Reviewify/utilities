I'm reviewing the bar upstairs, not the restaurant.\n\nIt's the kind of place where you can drink your face off and dance if you feel like it. There's a club on the third floor, and sometimes you'll see a long line trying to get up there. \n\nMy only big problem here is the bartenders really suck. They tend to cater to their friends and boobs. I understand, but it's why they end up with a crappy tip. I don't ask for much, just a quick passing of the beer from the cooler to my hand. It takes a fraction of the time required to make some chick's fruity mixed drink. \n\nI only go here when a bunch of friends are headed there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "y1Bw86Rv98bDYoH4ICDSgg"}
