Started out at the Rancho Cucamonga location and now go to both Rancho and Claremont Studios. Love the boutique atmosphere. I go to Claremont for Shirin's classes. Her classes to me are the best. If you are new to spinning I suggest her beginners class on Saturday mornings. The instructors on both location are very good at what they do. Also love Patrick's classes at the Rancho location. Miss Eric's classes at night. If you can catch his class in the morning, try it...you will walk away wanting more. 1st class is free so what are you waiting for...sign up for a class now", "business_id": "94z1jW7rizqPBpAiDv6ToA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-26", "type": "review"}
