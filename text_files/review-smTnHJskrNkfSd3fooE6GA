I didn't like some of their more adventurous specialty sushi rolls - there's one with mango and lobster in a soy paper wrapping that sounded strange, looked fun, and was just too sweet for me. I liked all of the more traditional rolls. Service was fine, but I got the feeling that waitresses were avoiding us after the 2nd or 3rd round of ordering (we were doing the limitless menu, about $20 per person).\n\nThe inside looks like a cheesy vegas bar (color changing neon lights, mirrors), which is not necessarily a bad thing, just unexpected. I did enjoy the japanese jazz/pop songs. I was told that it gets crazy crowded and service slows down in the evening, so we went at 5:30 and got served quickly and efficiently. \n\nOverall pretty tasty, worth the money and I would go again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M0o9CXzYH_k6vgG-0vVkVw"}
