Giordano's. Uno's. This is a decent facsimile. Flavorful, good crust. Give it a whirl. I'll bet if the decor were a lot nicer, people would feel like they got their money's worth. It feels a little fast-food inside, but the pizza is pretty accurate. My mind was never blown while eating real chicago deep dish pizza, so I'm not sure what everybody else is expecting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HW501zexRpDLIYJ2dHWZ0g"}
