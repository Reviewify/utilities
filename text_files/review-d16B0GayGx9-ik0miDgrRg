And I was really frustrated with a few things. Mainly that this place doesn't show up on any app or site. And so I'm adding it to Yelp.\n\nVenue: Cool enough venue. They have a big main area in the back, big stage where everyone seemed to love getting on and doing a lil boogie. And they have a great sound system, plenty of bass  which is great :) Also they have tons of lasers and lights which is super fun.  They have a full bar in the back. And smoking is allowed but great ventilation for people like me that tend to have their eyes and throats dried out at other places and are forced to squint and develop a super fantastically unattractive smokers cough.\n\nParking: There is a parking lot like .2 miles past the venue on the right, and its $10. THAT parking lot is for suckers. don't park there. ACROSS the street..DIRECTLY across the street. is $5 parking. :) park there.\n\nThe night i was there: SUPER fun and cool music. I mean its DUBSTEP..whats not to like. (unless it gets repetitive..THEN its boring. but the DJ was awesome.) Enough lasers and glow-sticks and well...any night is going to be fun. Although it was 18+..so yes. WAY too many teenies and that was ultimately why i left early in search of a more mature crowd. Overall 4 stars is pushing it. I would say 3.6 is a better star rating. \n\nOverall cool place that I would go to again if i wanted to be in a place that reminds me of the year 1986 (i was born in 1987 so i have no idea what the year 1986 was like but you get the idea). Actually its like 1986 got in a car accident with the year 1995. All in all. Good stuff.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HUV9PpCIXJoSnQF9JdALOA"}
