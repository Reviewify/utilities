(unless it gets repetitive..then its boring. but the dj was awesome.) enough lasers and glow-sticks and well...any night is going to be fun. although it was 18+..so yes. way too many teenies and that was ultimately why i left early in search of a more mature crowd. overall 4 stars is pushing it. i would say 3.6 is a better star rating. overall cool place that i would go to again if i wanted to be in a place that reminds me of the year 1986 (i was born in 1987 so i have no idea what the year 1986 was like but you get the idea). actually its like 1986 got in a car accident with the year 1995. all in all. good stuff.", "business_id": "HUV9PpCIXJoSnQF9JdALOA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-12", "type": "review"}
