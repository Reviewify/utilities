He is an excellent neurologist and performed my surgery beautifully. I was told by another doctor that I would need a much more invasive surgery and Dr. Aldama recommended a much less invasive surgery that has completely alleviated my pain. If you need a back surgeon or neurosurgeon, there is no one better than Dr. Aldama! He is the doctor that other neurosurgeons send their families to!", "business_id": "ujxkhbgg5DfD-XGvrFdHyw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-12-08", "type": "review"}
