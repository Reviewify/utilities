We had: -salmon -medium-fatty tuna -fatty tuna (BAD!) -inari -mackerel -yellowtail -tilapia (bland) -smoked salmon -yellowtail -urchin -fluke (apparently bland, I'm not brave enough to try it) -striped bass (BAD!) -eel Tonight was a good night of sushi bravery--I tried urchin, salmon roe, and eel for the first time in years and discovered that I like all three. I also tried striped bass (now on my blacklist) for the first time and discovered that I hate it. The green tea is good. As Elaine M. says, the sushi does tend to fall apart easily (even when factoring in my clumsiness).", "business_id": "SSmHkP0tZ4TKn_YUOEkVUg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-11", "type": "review"}
