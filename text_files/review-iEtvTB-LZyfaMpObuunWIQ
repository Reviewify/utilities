This organic, head-to-tail restaurant serves French fare, using farm-fresh, local ingredients.\n\nSnag a seat at the dark, romantic yet casual bar, where the full menu is served.  You will be entertained by Craigie on Main's sharply-dressed, dexterous bartenders who craft old classics, attested by the small bottles of house-made infusions and bitters that line the bar.\n\nLike a mad scientist, our bartender poured, tasted and stirred two cocktails at a time, doling out Northern Lights ($11) with St. Germain, Scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki; and Ardoise ($11) with Rain, sage, juniper, and lime.\n\nStart with an appetizer of crispy fried pigs' tails ($17), sprinkled with pickled peanuts and pungent, sweet nc chm.  It tastes like the adopted baby of Susur Lee and Jacques P\u00e9pin--distinctly South Asian but rich and very decadent.\n\nFried onion rings on top? Yeah, that would be Jacques' idea, too.  Maybe I watched too many Looney Tunes episodes as a kid, but I thought pigs had coiled tails. Who's will open my wine now?\n\nI originally came for the milk-fed confit baby pig's head for two, but alas, a nor'easter prevented a proper delivery.  The pied de cochon Farci for two ($64) however, did not disappoint.  Enjoy a craft cocktail or two, as this pig's foot takes a full 45 minutes to prepare.\n\nWhen it arrives, it is a glorious, glistening trotter that is de-boned and stuffed with its own lush, succulent meat, wrapped in pork belly.  Jacques would be so proud.  Beautiful cross-sections of pork are soft, custard-like and gelatinous.  Served on a bed of creamy potatoes and kasha, sweetened with a mix of chestnuts, pioppini mushrooms and parsnip pur\u00e9e, it is a mosaic of flavors and colors.", "type": "review", "business_id": "58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA"}
