If I just want to sit and enjoy a drink with some friends and am in no rush then I don't mind poor service; which is what they have here.  They also have pretty good food and drinks for reasonable prices as long as you stay on the Happy Hour Menu.  Veer off and you're paying 2 or 3 times that amount. I gave it two stars because when I was there on Friday night the service was extra poor.  The waitress wasn't helpful and had kind of an attitude.  Even when we ordered a whole bottle of Champagne she didn't seem to care.  Then when we were the last ones in the place, instead of simply asking us to leave which we were expecting, the guy behind the bar started singing a song about people leaving.  I suppose that was his way of hinting that we should excuse ourselves, but why not just ask?  When I was leaving I gave him a stare and he said \"oh thanks for coming\" pretending like he wasn't just a complete a$$h*le. Anyway, if you're looking for no lines, no crowds and just a place to chill with your friends with bad service, this is the place!", "business_id": "HsrBr49livt6XtKbEzuHnQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-23", "type": "review"}
