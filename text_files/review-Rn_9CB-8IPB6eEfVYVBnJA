Thank God I go with Korean people or at least someone who can imitate Korean person and order my meal!  Came here with 10 people last night. Big party. Most of us ordered the bibimbap or the tofu soup, number #12 and #16 respectively. The bibimbap here was quite good--I was very surprised. I've had bad bibimbap, and, trust me, it's something you never want to experience. The tofu soup here was not bad as well. Def. not the best I've ever had, but above average for a Bay Area/UC Campus Korean restaurant. If you had to choose, def. go with the bibimbap. The panchans were quite good, but I did NOT like the radish. It had a fishy taste. But, yum on the kimchi.  The service wasn't bad either. The owner, who's an elder Korean adjusshi, took our orders and was very accommodating towards our party. He didn't force the standard 18% tipping policy that's often found in most restaurants and was very nice about charging multiple credit cards. One of my friends doesn't eat eggs and the owner allowed an extra egg in another friend's bibimpap. This is very unheard of it in most Korean restaurants! There were times he had to be reminded to refill our water, but everyone needs a reminder every now and then. Overall, great service.  I think he tried to be a bit personal with our table, telling a friend that she's eating bibimbap wrong: \"Bibim means 'mixed.' You have to mix it or Korean people think you dont know how to eat.\" He sounded a bit too forthcoming, but I think it was because of a language barrier. I find him to be very sweet.  I will def. come here again--the \"go to spot\" for Korean food near Berkeley.", "business_id": "we3YxbueOBb0f-m7ekYk2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-24", "type": "review"}
