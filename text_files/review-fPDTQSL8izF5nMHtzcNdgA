My girl friend and I agreed that we'd begin partying after we graduated high school so being able to finally do something as big as a rave like TAO was a big deal for us and Insomniac Events did not disappoint! Tiesto, Armin, Deadmau5 and many other big names normally play at TAO making it absolutely amazing and worth it!! I find raves with an endless list of dj's are much more worth it than going to a concert. Indoors and outdoor venues :) Based on my experience both years I give it 5 stars.. words just can't explain my experience. I don't do drugs or drink btw, this review is strictly being written by a gal who enjoys the music + dancing for 10+ hours. I'm going again this year but Insomniac Events isn't holding it anymore so I'm extremely curious for how the turn out is going to be.. I will review next year after my attendance ;)", "business_id": "rc4qORAfEQbbsdzdaQue0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-13", "type": "review"}
