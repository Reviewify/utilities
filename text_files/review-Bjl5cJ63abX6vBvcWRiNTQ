The service and the food as very hit and miss. While the jalape\u00f1o burger tops the heap, other food options are really not very interesting at all. Same can be said of the service - varying from good to bad. But I suppose that a vegetarian diner is both unique and welcome. I'm happy the place is around but I don't get too excited to visit very often.", "business_id": "S4a-MaxMszQjSPSs1JSM2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-05", "type": "review"}
