While the jalape\u00f1o burger tops the heap, other food options are really not very interesting at all. Same can be said of the service - varying from good to bad.\n\nBut I suppose that a vegetarian diner is both unique and welcome. I'm happy the place is around but I don't get too excited to visit very often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "S4a-MaxMszQjSPSs1JSM2A"}
