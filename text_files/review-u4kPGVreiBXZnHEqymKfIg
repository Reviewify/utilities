The workers there get easily stressed out by large groups and take out their frustrations on the customers.  A person in front of me ordered a fruit slushy and when she was handed something other than what was ordered, the guy asked her 2 or times if she was sure that that was what she got.  Since the place is small, it gets pretty loud in there and it's difficult to hear the workers yell out drink orders.  they need to invest in some kind of sound system with a mic.   the food is decent and the drinks were so-so.  I prefer Coco's which is next door.  friendlier staff, good food, and an incredible pineapple slushy drink.", "business_id": "xrknhNNYNNSLfsHk5iX69g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-24", "type": "review"}
