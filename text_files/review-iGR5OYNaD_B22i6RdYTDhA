They've got a bunch of paninis for $4.75 apiece, compared to Bocado across the street, where a panini costs twice as much. \n\nI tried the melanzana (eggplant), which was good, but not excellent. Still, it's plenty delicious for just five bucks! They also have a bunch of different Italian sodas and drinks (all in small European sizes) that are pretty hard to resist. \n\nThe atmosphere is really nice, with Italian opera music playing softly and all kinds of imported Italian foods available to take home. Plus the service is really nice and helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1kHV-hdQXDLeyRyrxn4p7g"}
