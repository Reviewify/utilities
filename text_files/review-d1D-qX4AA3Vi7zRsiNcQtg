I'm just sad it took me 3 years almost to come here.\n\nI'll say it, I'm a disgrace. My teacher from back in college would have shook his head in shame and renounced me as his student. Ever. But god was it fun trying and failing. Mainly because there are people of all levels at this place! The front, near the stage, is where most of the experienced dancers are and as you keep going back you'll see the level of proficiency drop...sometimes like a rock. But that's the fun part of it. You get to see people having fun no matter what level they're at! \n\nThe crowd is really interesting as well. There are people of all ages, different backgrounds, and dancing levels. And the biggest thing is that everybody is almost here just to dance, not to hit on or pick up anyone. So it makes having fun so much easier :) \n\nGone are the days when I could tell LA style from NY style, but I can say that most of the night (I went on a Friday) is salsa. There were a few bachatas to give the crowd a bit of rest and one cha cha cha and one merengue for the time that I was there. \n\nSo after my friend and I had sufficiently failed and bumped into strangers, and apologized profusely to them, we decided to sit and see what the club looked like from the stage. It's a big room..one giant big room. With a bar on the side, cash only. A few tables on the other side, coat hangers, and that's it folks! Nothing fancy. But my god I've never been so mesmerized at seeing people dance. Great experience all in all and I definitely want to re-learn salsa! \n\nOh and they do offer classes around 9pm before the night really starts. Friday and Saturday are best nights! Give it a try - go with cash for the entry fee and drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IrZ6Vux2YiF4rs5Y07RPAw"}
