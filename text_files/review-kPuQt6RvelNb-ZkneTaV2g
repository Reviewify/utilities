Don't expect to eat in often.  There's only 6 flavors available and that's really the only issue with this place.  The fruit and dried toppings were good.  I played it safe with Passion Fruit and loved it.  Throw some kiwi, strawberries, pineapple, and gummi bears, I was set.  \n\nI'd give this place another shot for another star.  Hopefully they'll change their flavors up often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "x04vQxJuYs3p4RtxlagWQA"}
