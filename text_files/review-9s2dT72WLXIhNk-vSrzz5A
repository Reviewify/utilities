Great location! In the heart of Downtown Providence, you are mere steps away from the Providence Place Mall, Riverwalk, Bank of America Skating Center, the list goes on. The only downside. . . parking. Don't expect to pay less than $20 for any garage in the area. Check in was quick and efficient, though the staff could have been more helpful when inquiring about the whole parking issue. The rooms are standard rooms. . . ours in particular was a 2 queen. Nothing special, television, desk, bathroom with the basics. Of note, the windows had no screens on them, so when opened, one could easily fall out. Being grown adults (though sometimes age doesn't affect action) this was a moot point. We asked for an extra cot and refrigerator for the room, both of which were delivered within 30 minutes of arrival. Visited the pool area, and only went in the hot tub. Loud kids jumping and splashing in the echoing, largely windowed area. Definitely not relaxing, but fun none-the-less. I would stay here again if need be in the future, its convenient nature boosts its appeal.", "business_id": "MYkGOtjw_e0F3xr8ZxUA1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-05", "type": "review"}
