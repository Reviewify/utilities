Delicious, of course, but there isn't a whole lot of variety. Mu Lan does, however, have a few more interesting dishes. I myself am ignorant to the Chinese culture, so I don't know how accurate it is. But I do know that it tastes good! Nothing that blew my brains out, but I cleared my plate both times I've eaten here.\n\nThey deliver, which is nice--but you really have to go to the restaurant. It's an old house with a lovely, traditional interior. Even the outside seating is great! LOVE this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kni47-g5-ux_JhCaxnJYBg"}
