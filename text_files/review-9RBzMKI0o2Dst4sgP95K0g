The rolls are fantastic and pretty cheap (2.60 something for 2 regular, 3.88 for two specials). I am a particular fan of the lunch menu which is wonderfully inexpensive ($6.31 for a miso soup and four rolls--definitely filling, or same price for an order of vegan pad thai.). The reason, however, I give it a four, is the customer service. They are definitely not the most polite and it can take hours if you sit in the restaurant to get service, or even, god forbid, a water refill. If you have time to sit and wait with your companion (or on your own), ordering in is certainly not the end of the world, but even during off hours, you can expect it to take, at minimum, thirty minutes to get your food. Which is why I am a regular pick up orderer, which has been awesome. I highly recommend the thai tea roll and the pad thai tea roll--they're delicious!", "business_id": "IiX7lGoQQE3T4wg_1cx8Og", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-16", "type": "review"}
