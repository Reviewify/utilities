It has all the basics you need to ward off that hangover: liquids, salts, and some carbs.\n\n-Interior\nA small restaurant, then again the plaza it's located in is small. There were several tables but packed tightly together, difficult to move about if it's busy. There is a long line of tables in the middle and if it's busy they'll put two parties next to each other, happened to us today. They also have outdoor seating and it's usually nice in SD so it's not really a problem in my opinion.\n\n-Service\nPho is pretty simple: broth, noodles, let the heat cook the meats. Service at pho restaurants are usually good however today they practically forgot one of my friend's orders, -1 point. Other than that the service here was good.\n\n-Food\nOrdered the dac biet, nothing special that puts it over other Vietnamese restaurants. It's OK, they have all the sauces to mix in with your pho and the extra toppings. If you were looking for pho near the UCSD campus then this is your best bet without having to drive out elsewhere.\n\nA-OK restaurant, wasn't anything spectacular and it wasn't a total letdown. If you're an aspiring student at UCSD and got a craving for pho to help you with your studies, then Pho La Jolla is here for your needs. Just remember to mention Yelp so you can get a 10% discount, don't know when this promotion is going to expire so take advantage while you can because all college students are already poor and need any help they can get.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MeSeqjo33YKxfqY1oKxOSg"}
