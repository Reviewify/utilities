It was extremely busy-all tables inside were taken. \n\nAlthough, they were very busy. There was little to no wait to order or to even get your food. \n\nThe staff was extremely nice and friendly.\n\nI ordered the grilled turkey and avocado salad-it was decent! It was a nice big salad with lots of turkey, avocado, and veggies. I did ask for dressing on the side and it ended up with it on the salad--my only compliant.  It made the salad a little soggy since they put a ton of dressing on it. \n\nI love the pickle and olive bar!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AMZQL6tnY6mO9jO9-hwdNA"}
