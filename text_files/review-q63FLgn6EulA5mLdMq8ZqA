I usually get the lobster bisque and tuna melt combo. However, I have also gotten their oysters and fish fish platter. The fish platter or plate is a ton of food good for more than one person. They have an outside terrace perfect for spring of fall. There used to be a huge tree for shade, but I'm guessing it got crusty and had to be chopped down. Beer and oysters. How can you go wrong?", "business_id": "ztY4uPNUTWMN9LT3L5mD3Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-02-10", "type": "review"}
