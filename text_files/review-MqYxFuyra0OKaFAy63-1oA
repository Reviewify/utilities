The bus goes straight from the stop on Kinross to LAX, and it is surprisingly efficient.  Overall, this saves you from having to park at the stupidly expensive LAX parking lots, and it saves your friends from having to do you the \"favor\" of driving you all the way to LAX.  Highly recommended. Note: They only take exact change, so there was one time when I had to go buy something cheap from a nearby store just to make sure I had exact change.", "business_id": "t6qBeLsoKOUmUwJCTFyjuQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-25", "type": "review"}
