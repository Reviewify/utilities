I you get the jamon con juevo burrito with everything. lets just say you are full for the day!!  Hurry up because they close once the meat sells out!!  Sometimes as early as 2pm!!! If you miss out then that's just too bad.. you can always go to del taco and Taco Bell in Figueroa or maybe Chipotle!!  at this point I feel bad for you....", "type": "review", "business_id": "iNQQFc8BhrPdfPJaeKIyYw"}
