This was my go to place for BBQ. I'll say though, the ribs aren't where its at here. If you are obsessed with a spicy and tangy BBQ sauce and enjoy pulled pork, then you'll love this place.  If you are looking for slow cooked, meat falling off the bone ribs, make them yourself.  If you have a hankerin for ribs, and think that juicy/tenderness matter's more than sauce, and don't wanna cook them yourself, go to fatt matt's.", "business_id": "KOMIvmCfTopTffTzP730pw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-29", "type": "review"}
