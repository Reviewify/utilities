When I first started dating my man before we moved in together we ate here all the time. We both lived in places with lots of roommates and barren kitchens. The location is convenient for U people, the price is cheap, the size is big, and the food is so good. Oh yeah, and they were pretty much the only place open when we got off work. My fave is the saut\u00e9ed broccoli, but the eggplant is tasty and different. The sweet & sour isn't really done the way I like it, but I'll eat it. Oddly enough, the chicken wings are really good: slightly spicy (barely) with a nice flavor. Careful, though; sometimes the fried rice is burnt.", "business_id": "hpoUWb4V9t58CxfdNMYigg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-20", "type": "review"}
