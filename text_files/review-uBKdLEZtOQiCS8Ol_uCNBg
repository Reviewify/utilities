You can tell when the staff hasn't been given the empowerment they need to serve the customers. You can also tell when they have not gotten the proper screening or training. When that happens, I always head to Flemings where you're always guaranteed stellar personal service along with fantastically prepared and presented foods. They have an interesting wine list, too, and sometimes I'll settle for a comfortable meal at the bar with friends.", "business_id": "2LrIkZB7mOwu8-9OVhjWfQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-07", "type": "review"}
