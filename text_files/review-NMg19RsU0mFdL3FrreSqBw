Most Boca Grandes are meh, but this is meh supreme.  Salsa and hot sauce somehow both manage to be bland.  Not sure how this is possible when a main ingredient is raw onion/pepper, but they achieve it.   1 extra star because my love for all burritos transcends this experience.  Tortilla+beans+cheese+rice = magic.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pp7GzAZtreah8vqJOLbqWg"}
