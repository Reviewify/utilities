It does offer quick and attentive service and the prices are reasonable. The menu tries to be too many things; spanish=cuban=mexican does not compute. Most cuban and spanish food should not be too spicy. You should be able to detect the flavors of the sofrito; the onion, garlic and peppers and the tomato and saffron. The margarita stands up to most in town and they don't charge you for refills on the chips and salsa. I was driving by and stopped in on a whim. I don't think I'll do it again, there are many other options in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zx5fNxBc6gIRRrBCVvYgqA"}
