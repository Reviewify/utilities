It is so much more than just a sandwich shop. First, the menu is awesome. Every single thing I've ever ordered here has been fabulous. My personal favorite is the California Club - it's turkey, guacamole, bacon, tomato, and sprouts, all inside a croissant. If you don't know what to order, get this one! They also make a mean reuben, if you like reubens. The awesome thing, though, is the extras! First, each meal comes with sides. I always get fruit with this awesome tart yogurt-ish dip - I enjoy this part of the meal as much as the sandwich! AND, you can help yourself to all the little mini muffins you can handle - your choice of honey cornbread or a dark, I dunno, is it bran muffin? Both are great. Then to top it off, all the free soft-serve ice cream cones you want! I love the location here. Rice Village is just a wonderful place to spend time, and this restaurant has a little patio sitting area. But be careful - if you sit outside, never leave your food unattended! The pidgeons have turned into vultures, and will descend on your food the moment you turn your back! However, this is one more great thing about this location - very helpful and friendly staff - when the pidgeons got my lunch, they replaced it for free!", "business_id": "pLS3b_A1zfsMPQYpMrVmzg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-03-03", "type": "review"}
