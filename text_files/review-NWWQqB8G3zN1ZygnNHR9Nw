Self-storage was so easy with them, especially with their awesome free moving taxi! Just be sure you reserve one ahead of time-- they fill up fast. My only grumble is that I didn't really know what I was getting into when they told me I had a top storage unit. Having a top storage unit is such a hassle, because you have to push a heavy stair ladder to your unit and then climb up and down to retrieve your stuff. It's just very tedious. Otherwise, everything was so great. I can't emphasize enough how helpful and friendly the customer service was.", "business_id": "s5KdgqPa9CMf9U-hfmErPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-14", "type": "review"}
