It is a big rtion that I can rarely finish in one sitting. If you eat in, you also get fries for free. The service is pretty quick, although they do get quite busy at lunch time. The sandwiches come out hot and to order. I usually get the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak with L,T,M,O and always enjoy it. They also offer adding an egg, which can be yummy. Highly recommend for a delicious hot sandwich at lunch or dinner. Negatives: - The restaurant itself looks kinda run-down from the furniture, to the floors, to the poor lighting. Although they seem to be going for an \"old\" look, it could really use a facelift. - They only take CASH. They have a ATM-like machine to get cash, but it will charge you for the transaction. - Wish they were open late!", "business_id": "mG5gV8OWUTp21vLQqmoFFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-12", "type": "review"}
