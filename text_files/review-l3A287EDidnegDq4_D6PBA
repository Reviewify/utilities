They do not have meters in their cabs. They have to call in the addresses to a dispatcher who determines the rates. Their licenses are not diplayed. We were charged $22 to go 6.8 miles, and then $20 to go 2 miles.\n\nWhen we called in to ask for clarification on the fare, Von Mangum the dispatcher, refused to give any reasonable explanation besides we were \"out of the zone\". She then got very rude and refused to talk to us anymore and threatened to charge us with a DUI....which is funny because we were in a taxi.\n\nAwful company.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ATqKQHGS-iyNpzks8SV95w"}
