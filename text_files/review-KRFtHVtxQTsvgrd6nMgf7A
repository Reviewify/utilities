The server promptly greeted us, menued and watered us, then LEFT US ALONE because she saw we were engaged in a conversation and hadn't even looked at the menus for several minutes. I cannot tell you the number of times I have been to restaurants where the server demands you operate on THEIR time and order exactly when THEY want you to--harassing you by coming back even if you haven't initially opened...or closed the open menu, signifying you are NOT ready to order. No rude server interruptions at Saigon! They observed and noticed when WE were ready.\n\nThe server was very kind in answering questions and letting me know the vegetarian/vegan options. The food was GREAT! I was not expecting it to be so tasty. The prices were reasonable, service was probably the best in Ithaca, great food, and they show concern for the environment (and the bottom line) with washable chopsticks. So great!\n\n--now I'll have to check if they compost....", "type": "review", "business_id": "FJsh0TOIQJWj3aQP4Yg0_A"}
