The menu is set up the same way, except there are a few more ingredients here and this place offers some pre-made burrito ideas if you're not quite as innovative. I ordered the Classic Mexican burrito (steak, pinto beans, cheese, cilantro, salsa) with a whole wheat tortilla, no rice, and habanero salsa. I LOVE spicy food, so I'm a fan of the habanero salsa. My roommate, however, can barely manage with just a small bite of it, so watch out if you're not a spicy food person! I came in at around 6pm on a Monday night and it was basically empty. They messed up on my order the first time through and would have messed up a second time if I didn't catch them. Overall the burrito was just okay, but I'd still rather go to Chipotle. You don't get as much for your money here.", "business_id": "is_3J5wgSNx142iNaNrSHQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-07", "type": "review"}
