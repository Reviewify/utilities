Despite multiple suggestions regarding the use the pads which they did in fact bring to the job, Patrick remained aloof and manhandled my furniture into severe damage territory.  When contacted about the damage, he refused to cover the cost of getting the damage fixed and was condescending and accusatory in tone.  Neither moving or customer service is particularly strong with this operation.\n\nIf you have a lot of Ikea furniture and heavy stuff you don't care much about, these guys are cheap and manage to get awkwardly large pieces of furniture down stairs with relative ease.  If you have furniture you don't want damaged, stay away.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J0_ihDCYiXm97XVzbx0Drg"}
