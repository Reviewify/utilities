I love the way she cuts my hair -- the first time I saw her I was growing my hair out into a new style and she had great plans for that in-between stage. She really takes time to work with your particular hair types and styling needs/skills. Plus she's a lot of fun to talk to while she works!\n\n(I think that some of the stylists don't take credit cards, so you might want to check on that beforehand if you don't carry a bunch of cash around.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "DIoz9sgQU_Di_qJGfF5tMQ"}
