Features healthy plants and the help is wonderful. You'll also find a whimsical collection of outdoorsy/garden items. I recommend you drop by here. Be ready to be pleasantly surprised at the quality and value here -- and marvel at how much they can fit into a small space. A portion of proceeds go to a worthy nonprofit, and the prices here can't be beat given for what you get. You pay more at many nurseries and gift shops.", "business_id": "EuH5w-Xp4BADgtGUR58bDQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-03", "type": "review"}
