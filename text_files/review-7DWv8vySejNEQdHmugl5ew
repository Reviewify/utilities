Is there a Korean niche here greater than K-Town's that I am unaware of? My second thought, \"Why that lot?\" The space used to be home to a yogurt stand that no one went to. It's in a corner and the windowfront is tiny. Okay, so long story short, my issue with this place is location. Aside from that, the sandwiches are tasty and look great. They're well constructed- they sit flat and are served cut in half. When you first get the sandwich, you can see fine layers of the many fresh ingredients they use... and they use many. The philosophy here is to use a mix of veggies and proteins to create a healthy sandwich- mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, egg, peppers, onion, cheese, and your meat(s) of choice. The price is okay, a little much for just a sandwich so this will be a once-in-a-while place for me. The one thing that should be noted though is that the guys manning the place are wonderful. They're so warm, pleasant, and attentive! My first visit there was with my co-worker, who was looking for fountain soda. Although only one drink was purchased, the cashier invited us back, handing us coupons for a free drink with a sandwich purchase. We went back a few days later and while when we left, he let us sample the coffee.", "business_id": "z0Y_CqAXFATiY-jggR-apQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-27", "type": "review"}
