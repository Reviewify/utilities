I've only had dry cleaning done there, no laundry, but they did a great job getting pine sap out of a very expensive garment I had.  And the only person I have seen working there (outgoing, cheerful, good-looking Asian guy) has always been great, even calling me with updates about the sap stain and some advice I had asked about something else.  Can't beat the service! And my stuff has always been delivered at the time promised or early.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7bhSfeciTNK2J9yNNTDMnw"}
