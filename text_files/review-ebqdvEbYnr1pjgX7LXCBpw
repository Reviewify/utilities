I hate to build up the already hyped but there's no denying its brilliance. \"Oh you've never been to Diddy Riese? WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!? LETS GO RIGHT NOW\" is my reaction to any of my friends whose never been. Their cookies are always fresh!!! You see a Jose taking out a fresh batch every 2 minutes.. or less. The cookie itself melts in your mouth but when paired with the ice cream....UNFFF. Seriously jizzing my pants right now just thinking of the usual Chocolate White Chocolate Chip cookie & White chocolate chip cookie sandwiching my Stawberry cheesecake ice cream.... It used to be $1.50 but I believe it's $1.75 now. Who the hell cares. And you guyssss, it's open real late to serve your midnight craving or munchies. The only downside is the wait. There's always a line, night and day. It's right by UCLA so there are always students.. But the workers do a hell of a job to keep the line moving. I mean, come on, there are cookies waiting for us!! Lol. It's worth it, I pinky promise you.", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-18", "type": "review"}
