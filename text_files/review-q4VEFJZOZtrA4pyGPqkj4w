Wish I had discovered it earlier. The food was decent and the ambiance is intimate. This is a great place to take a date; small cars with limited tables, cozy fireplaces, dim antiquated lighting.  Even the box car with the bathrooms behind a glass walled bar is eclectic and well laid out. The music- Mahalo jazz was playing. What fun group and a great vibe. The bar was laid back. The jazz group invited a lady from the audience to perform with them- she had so much fun. Just a cool place all around.", "business_id": "fls_PaY91L-AKVnoanfOAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-18", "type": "review"}
