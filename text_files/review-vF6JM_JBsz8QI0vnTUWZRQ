Back in the day, a couple of ROTC buddies and I used to gear up and jog the route, which I assure you was quite the workout.\n\nIt's a great place to be on the weekends as well, as you'll see tons of couples, kids, pets, and just folks running, biking, and walking. Several areas have these grassy knolls where folks tend to kick back and lie down or sunbathe.\n\nNo matter what you're looking to do, as long as you want to spend some time in the great outdoors, somewhere along the Schuylkill Banks, you'll find the right place for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MtEpw40QBJYMkDTbBBv5Ag"}
