It's a bit overpriced for the class of service you get -- I would rate this place probably 2 stars but it gets a 3 for location.  \n\nYou can stay at the nearby Radisson for something a bit more upscale, but also a lot more money.  The Radisson and Vagabond are your only choices for something within walking distance of USC.\n\nI got a clean, quiet and comfortable room here, so no complaints.  Free internet access and free parking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ehp0Ra533DXRMLMIygFB1g"}
