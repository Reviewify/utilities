It's a bit overpriced for the class of service you get -- I would rate this place probably 2 stars but it gets a 3 for location. You can stay at the nearby Radisson for something a bit more upscale, but also a lot more money. The Radisson and Vagabond are your only choices for something within walking distance of USC. I got a clean, quiet and comfortable room here, so no complaints. Free internet access and free parking.", "business_id": "Ehp0Ra533DXRMLMIygFB1g", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-07-11", "type": "review"}
