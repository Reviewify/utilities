Following a long night of celebratory imbibing, we traveled to the Heights in search of nourishment and you got it, hair of the dog. For $9.95 on the weekends, the Heights offers your choice of brunch entree plus a $3 mimosa, glass of champagne, Bloody Mary, margarita OR draft beer. Hmmm... we're in NYC so I'm thinking the price tag screams impending food failure.\n\nI was wrong! A mere 20 minutes later, I was able to wholeheartedly vouch for the eggs Benedict with bacon. Benedict is a back-up on my last meal list, so I've tried many, many versions. But the Height's rendition ranked among the best. My friends enjoyed their omelets, chef salads, breakfast burrito and of course, cocktails. The mimosa could have used a more liberal pour of bubbly, but at $3 it's a steal. Also, the Heights serves 6 or 7 fantastic import drafts if beer is your preference.\n\nService is unapologetically woeful, but they did let us linger for an extra hour and refilled our coffee/water often. Oh, and don't sit at the table closest to the door during the winter as the steady stream of incoming patrons will require the pesky presence of your coat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vHzWvZYbkoHY_071J-lPRw"}
