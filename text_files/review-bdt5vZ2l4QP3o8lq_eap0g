The fact that they serve Mimosas that are pulpy and bubbly is awesome and I always like a place that serves Mimosas at any time of the day. \n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Spanikopita, which was yummy but I wish had just a little more philo dough to it. However it was a good size for sharing. \n\nI had a tuna melt on rye and Zoe's fries. The tuna melt was good but for me there was too much tuna. I like a more even tuna/bread ratio in my melts. The rye bread was yummy and surprisingly low grease level for a diner. The Zoe's fries were delicious with feta cheese and oregano. The feta was just a little melty, which was perfect. The portion of fries was huge.\n\nMy wife got the Haddock sandwich and was a little underwhelmed because she felt the coating was more suited to a chicken sandwich. She barely made a dent in the huge portion of fries.\n\nThe damper on the meal was the 20 minute wait for the check. The cafe was vary sparse so there really wasn't a reason for the wait. I finally gave up and walked to the front counter to find our waitress and pay the bill. This resulted in us being way late for an event. \n\nThe menu was filled, nice choices for breakfast and I wish I could had the room to have ordered a cheesecake frappe for dessert. Zoe's Cafe has huge portions, yummy fries, but you might have to be a little more proactive when it comes to the service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GHe641VggznYYFnD9RM8pQ"}
