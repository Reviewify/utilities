It looks like your average brewery restaurant.  The menu look diverse ranging from steak to mexican to pasta.  The beer I ordered was the house white or light beer.  It was good but had a bitter after taste.  I ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos.  They were top 3 best tacos I've ever had.  I like the double decker texture.  Soft and crunchy shell.  I wouldn't eat here frequently but every once and a while. The price is around your ordinary casual restaurant.", "business_id": "oIgx5AEdeBnsibH7GJc2fg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-06-07", "type": "review"}
