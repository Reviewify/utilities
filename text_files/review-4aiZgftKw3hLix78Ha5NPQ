That's 6 places within 4 blocks!! \n\nIt's true! Pinkberry, Mr. Snowberry, Berry-something (that place inside of Damon&Pythias), Polar Monkey, Piccomolo... and of course RED MANGO.\n\nWith so many options, what's a Bruin to do?!  \n\nBy far, RED MANGO is the superior 'yogurt that's been frozen' - I must distinguish it from froyo, which I classify as things resembling golden spoon, which none of these do.  You have to travel a little farther to Big Chill on WestwoodxOlympic to find a 'frozen yogurt'.\n\nBetter yogurt (creamier and colder), Better toppings (incl. ghiradelli chocolate!), Better service.  AND with the Westwood Savings Card from the Daily Bruin, you get 15% off each visit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HIMf3YGzD96XewWKqL1-eg"}
