No doubt inside was like many other dinners decorated with Marilyn Monroe and Elvis images. Not in perfect condition but a decent set up. The meals are the same as Denny's but prices are high but when you get the food, you know where that extra cash went; real ingredients not processed.The service was really nice however, after we finished our server left for a good 20 minutes leaving us completed alone and unable to leave. As i debated leaving cash on the table and walking out we hailed down a server from the back and paid. The meal was amazing and was so big i could even finish. Tasted better than the same thing i get at Denny's or any other sit down joint; the slices of meat were thick cut not layered thin like served at Denny's. A quiet place to eat and talk.", "type": "review", "business_id": "du0tHy1a1XlgLHcOBOxTgg"}
