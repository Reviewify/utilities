We were so happy when they expanded to NJ that we would drive by the construction site a bit too frequently (!) waiting for this mecca of all things food and more to open. Now, a few years later, Wegmans continues to shine! Yep, it's a zoo on many weekends and any day before a holiday, but who cares when you love something as much as we love Wegmans?! For the few haters out there that say it's high priced, etc. stay happy at your craptacular world class Shop Rites, pathetic Pathmarts and more. If you really want high prices, shop Whole Foods or McAffrey's. Can't beat Wegmans' produce, store brands, selection, quality, or happy and helpful employees! We Love You Wegmans.", "business_id": "RCGryVRZqKvnDH4Yyhhe8w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-27", "type": "review"}
