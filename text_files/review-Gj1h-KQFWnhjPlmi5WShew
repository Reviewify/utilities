I mean, the store is great.. Always clean, open 24 hours, and usually fully stocked with booze.\n\nI guess my only gripe about the store itself is that the lines can be super long and the customers can be super slow (DON'T COME HERE IN THE MORNING.. That's when all the old ladies of westwood come flocking and they count pennies in line, search for coupons, and chit chat slash complain for hours to the poor cashiers and it takes forever to get your stuff)\n\nSo why the two stars? The mother effin PARKING LOT. I HATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE ENTRANCE AND ONE EXIT. AND the fact that there's always that one person who forgets to validate their parking and makes the rest of us wait in a traffic jam for 20 minutes before we can get out. JUST GET RID OF THAT STUPID GATE and everyone will be better off :).", "type": "review", "business_id": "GGzgUd6k6aOHPp7PrT6d6g"}
