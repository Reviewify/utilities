They are very unorganized and slow to assist you.  I have been waiting quite a while for a check from my trade in.    My contact person is a gentleman named Ben, he never returns my phone calls.  If they assign you to him, I suggest that you ask for someone else.  However, I spoke to the general manager, himself, he said he would look into my case and return my phone call the following business day.  I haven't heard anything from him either. Pretty sad.  They were great on the day of purchase, (isn't that always the case) but it's been hell ever since.   If you are thinking of trading in a car to them, unless they've given you an amazing offer, I would strongly suggest going to Carmax.  They seem to be pretty unorganize and it's very difficult to get them to return your phone call.  That isn't a great experience when they owe you a pretty sizeable check.", "business_id": "m1_YeSmKgYuwsuA24VqL1g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-19", "type": "review"}
