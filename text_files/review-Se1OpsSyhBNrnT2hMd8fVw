Well, I do agree with what others say but I don't think this place deserves two stars. The frosting is much too sweet but the cake is light and delicious. They should refine their frosting recipe but if you're really craving a cupcake these are perfectly capable of satisfying that craving.", "business_id": "ud1IIvhgpbZQHTQlCJkWYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-04", "type": "review"}
