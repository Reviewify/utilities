We will not repeat that mistake again. I should have seen it coming.  The woman taking my order was indifferent, bored????.  The food: the fries were soggy, cold and tasteless. The peppers on the side must have escaped during delivery.  The hoagie/cheese steak rolls are lacking in flavor.  They are too soft.  Not  great rolls. Delivery: it took over an hour to deliver.  Guess why? The delivery guy is on a bicycle.  Hello Lees!!!!", "business_id": "yhGRai3h-Qt_co9-zwc2Sw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-10", "type": "review"}
