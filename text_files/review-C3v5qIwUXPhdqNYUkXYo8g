They do sandwiches for meat lovers and nonmeat lovers.  I love the Bulgogi sandwich, I tried the Philly sandwich and it was just ok.  You can call in advance to have your sandwich prepared for pickup, and they serve huge portions of fries.  Good in my book for a quick lunch.", "business_id": "XowT8Y7kGXpIpfrZKsheOw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-08", "type": "review"}
