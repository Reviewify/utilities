This feels like a place that would rather squeeze every last dollar out of its patrons than provide an enjoyable experience.  Drinks are standardly delivered very slowly during happy hour, and a server once refused to bring my table free chips and salsa (advertised as a happy hour special) because we had not specifically requested them. Overall, unsatisfying and impersonal.", "business_id": "2vUYE4Pjtgw8rjpPg4RMGg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-12-30", "type": "review"}
