I love, love, love the James Perse and C&C California shirts (so soft!). They also have an entire section of the store devoted exclusively to high-end denim, with friendly and knowledgable sales representatives to help you find your best fit and brand. I do hate those dressing rooms with curtains instead of doors, but I've only ever seen a couple of men in the store (always accompanied by women) so the likelihood of being seriously embarrassed is low. Most of the stuff is pricey of course, but they do have trunk sales every so often and you can occasionally find random items that have been marked down. As Christina said, you can only get store credit for returns, so make sure you're really committed to that thousand dollar Paddington bag before you lay down the plastic.", "business_id": "q5Qbf57ZUt0BMARDDia2kw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-09-20", "type": "review"}
