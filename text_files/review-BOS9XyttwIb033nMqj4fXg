HAHAH \n\nWell the service is great-  if you have something to return- no problems here.  They have the best selection of NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP football gear- with AUTHENTIC jerseys!   I have never had an issue here and they do their best on gamedays in terms of crowd control and lines.  Just avoid on gamedays and go during a weekday to get the best selection.  The only thing I would not buy here are the Helmets-  you can find a better deal online.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Tc4eLpzyFjbmmcLN3oUEGw"}
