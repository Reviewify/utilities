It took some time to decide what to order, but we ended up getting a buffalo chicken pizza which was really good! Their large could have easily satisfied 2-3 people depending on your appetite. Our server was really nice and I always saw her checking up on us- she was trying to balance work and cognitive psych, so I assume she's also a GT student. Nice. The front of the place is smoky, and we went during Germany vs. Uruguay for 3rd place. As with most sports bars, this place is where you should go to watch games and have a drink (apparently their drinks are a good deal) I find that the overall attitude of this place is like a Vortex-wannabe sports bar fusion (esp. if you read their disclaimer on the back of the menu), but truth is these guys have character in a much more respectable manner- it's not so in your face or crude (Vortex: ~!@#$ you! Rocky Mtn: To hell with you and Georgia!!!). I much rather go to this place for its laid back atmosphere. Also, bonus points to the servers because some of them had really cute outfits on- the waitress we had at Vortex in Little 5 had crocs on. CROCS at Little 5 and cute outfits at GT?! Come on, don't be outdone! My impression of this place is that it is what it is and they did very well!", "business_id": "dlN9tXw24o4gcREvSGNkgQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-12", "type": "review"}
