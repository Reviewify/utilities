Other than buying accessories here, I've also taken my bike in twice and they helped me figure out what I needed to buy to fix it for no charge (except for the parts), and gave me a quick tutorial on how to do it. Definitely the best bike shop I've been to in Ithaca.", "business_id": "FVPW69_227gv2zSq46-FhQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-09", "type": "review"}
