I live in Sacramento and there is no where to go to get quality skin care. I came to shirley to get a facial, but after she thoroughly ( and I mean thoroughly) inspected my skin, she gave me a few options to achieve the results I am looking for. This woman is exceptionally intelligent, charming, witty and honest!!!! If the world had more women like her, it would be called heaven! I have an appointment tomorrow for a peel. She explained the process with the utmost patience. It took her about an hour to explain everything to me, she didn't charge me a penny. She is passionate about skin care and about making her clients happy. I got a brazilian with her that same day. Although she has unusual ways to wax (she makes you get on all 4s lol) she was very respectful, and thorough. If I lived in Pasadena I would religiously go see her for waxing. The best part, she charged me for a bikini wax :) I highly recommend Shirley---she's pretty awesome.", "business_id": "TK48Y_-Uff1hUp1aAhq62w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-02", "type": "review"}
