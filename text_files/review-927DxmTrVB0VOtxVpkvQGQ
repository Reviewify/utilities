It sure has, and for good reason: open, clean design; unpretentious food; and, of course, damn fine beer. There's a little something for those that don't like German food (like me), but it would be a shame not to try the lamb sausages and the recommended pairing, a mouth-watering amber Czech beer. The patrons can be as international as the menu, or as local as the staff. I'm already a repeat customer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fk495HaokZDrGkAG8s_dlg"}
