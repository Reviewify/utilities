They've gutted the place and made it modern and full of light in attempts to draw a different clientele but replacing the Karl Kani velour track suits with $200 Ed Hardy graphic hoodies isn't exactly going to broaden the consumer demographic, ya know?\n\nTo be fair, there's a decent browsing selection of kicks: Jordans, Dunks and Creative Recreation in baby sizes too though most of the store is filled with sparse racks of men's urban gear. With their closing hours before 6pm they don't stay open late enough to catch the after work crowd; I don't foresee myself returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ThJVx9dOsqaLA__ZKqJ12w"}
