The Carne Asada burrito is JUICY, MEATY, AND RICELESS. It's got guacamole and.... tons of tomatoes, onions, cylantro, beans, and etc. It's the perfect Carne Asada Burrito.  The hot sauce is pretty spicy, but not overly. It's rather mild, if anything.  food is cheap.  I don't know what else to say about it.", "business_id": "m8oV_h-OV3AoPicvieCJEQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-05-21", "type": "review"}
