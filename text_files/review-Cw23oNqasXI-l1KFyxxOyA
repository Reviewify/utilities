The food was excellent, particularly giving compliments to the breakfast/brunch pizza dishes. Service was efficient, exceptional service by our waitress, Emily. I was especially impressed by the manager (Derek, I believe?) who was very friendly and able to visit our table to see how food and service turnout was. Next time around, I would like to revisit this restaurant for dinner to compare the quality of food with their breakfast/brunch menu. Overall, I'm very pleased with the food, service and overall quality of the Mayfield Bakery.", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-05", "type": "review"}
