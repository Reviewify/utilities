The individual in the last review said all of the beer companies didn't show up...this may be true but there was still so much beer that it would almost be impossible for one person to try every single one.  \n\nI liked the set up as the booths were close together.  We recently went to a beer fest in San Diego and you had to walk like a mile between each booth and that cut into our drinking time.  \n\nThey had a band playing some great cover songs and a giant California bear taking pictures with people.  \n\nThe tickets were $40 ($35 presale) and it included hours of unlimited tasting.  They even had Guinness flavored ice cream for sale!  Overall, great festival for any beer lover.", "type": "review", "business_id": "weryrLYEmYxSjh1AIYB-sQ"}
