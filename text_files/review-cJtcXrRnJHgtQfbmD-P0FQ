Every time my friends wanted to meet up for a quick brunch before class or to feel alive again after an epic night of drinking, we always ended up here. The prices are awesomely cheap, the food is so delicious and comforting, and the balcony view of Durant and Telegraph is fun. I love their combo plates -- you can get fruit salad, eggs, and pancakes all on one plate! Their sandwiches are so satisfying too -- I really like the salmon. And half of the menu is Mexican food, so with items like huevos rancheros and breakfast burritoes, you can't go wrong either way. Oh, and their coffee is the perfect amount of bitterness. Nothing like Starbucks that tends to burn the beans. BEST HANGOVER BREAKFAST EVER!", "business_id": "BOCJ5g4q1RhP8wikwwr3Ow", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-30", "type": "review"}
