It's a sorely needed addition to Harvard Square, the renovations are lovely, and it has some interesting beverages. Oh, and the bathrooms are spacious and clean. But I popped in this afternoon to try their birthday cake cupcake, and sadly, it was quite the disappointment. Loved the frosting, which has a nice buttery taste and doesn't slap you in the face with a pound of sugar, but the cake part sucks. It was the most uncupcakey cupcake I've ever had. It was crusty on the outside and overly crumbly and dry on the inside. Actually, it kind of reminded me of a muffin. I want to like this place, and I'm reserving my final judgment until I've tried a few other items on the menu. But right now, I'm afraid it's just going to be one of those overpriced cafes with mediocre food.", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-11", "type": "review"}
