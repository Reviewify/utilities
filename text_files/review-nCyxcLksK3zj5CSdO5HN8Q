The locals were very quick to express their shock and disbelief! As I stood in line to place my first order here, I was slightly worried that I would say something wrong. Luckily, I got it down, \"cook me up those famous cakes!\" The namesake, Michael, thanked me for my order and served me up some of the most amazing pancakes I have ever had (Better than DeNeve breakfast and Griddle). Great find, I am looking forward to my next visit.", "business_id": "arAOlVph7XutNDtRV7jtTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-05", "type": "review"}
