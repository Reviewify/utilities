The coffee is done how it should be at completely fair prices. After ordering your coffee comes fairly quickly (perfect for in between classes). My favorite moment was when Sam (the owner) handed back my travel mug with electrical tape over the \"Starbucks, Inc\" and said, \"Here you go. Your mug was broken, so I fixed it.\"\nOn a campus where you constantly feel like a number/walking cash cow, this place pays attention to you and your coffee.\n\nIt's only setback are the short hours, and (sometimes) long lines.", "type": "review", "business_id": "khvWGKid1cahwwYuYa35Ng"}
