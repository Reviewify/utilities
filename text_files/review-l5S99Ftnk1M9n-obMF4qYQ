Customer service is usually ok.  Went here for routine maintenance, break & strut replacement.  They did a good job on oil changes and maintenance.  Felt pressured to buy a better quality strut than what was recommend by the manufacturer.  After getting the struts replaced my car started making a weird noise when turning the wheel for the first time after starting up.  Took it back twice and they couldn't find anything wrong.  Weekends get pretty crazy but they do usually work pretty well to fix your issue.  I have found a better place to go for car repair.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MqN8edYnZtEcDRj4Qq6RRQ"}
