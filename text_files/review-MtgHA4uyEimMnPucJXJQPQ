I suppose if you like mixing in your toppings, like I do, this is not such a calamity.  I was, however, tremendously impressed when the Death by Chocolate dropped down in thick ringlets.  When I mixed in my M&Ms, chocolate chips, and Ghiradelli's chocolate sauce, I could still taste the difference between this thicker froyo and some of the thinner ones I have had recently (cough, cough Yogurtland).  And best part was that my concoction of wonder was just under $3.  What a steal! My only compliant is that they do not have Red Velvet (though I was told this might appear in the future) and that they have the mini M&Ms as a topping and not the full-sized ones.  It would actually be in their best interest to get the bigger ones because they weigh more and thus, people will pay more.
