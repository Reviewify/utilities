Rented a single sea kayak twice, once for a one-hour lunch break (to the Harvard Bridge and back), and another time, starting in Allston and paddling one way to Kendall.  This last one-way trip was more enjoyable, a pleasant tour of my favorite parts of the Charles, and doable in an hour.  A pity CRCK wasn't around 25 years ago, but at least they've brought the kayaks to the Charles finally!  The service is generally friendly and efficient, although one teenager on his summer job has a few things to learn about customer service.", "business_id": "1do2Cl_u1bTOflTDQJJtSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-15", "type": "review"}
