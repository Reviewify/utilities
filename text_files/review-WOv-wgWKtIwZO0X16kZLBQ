Morons include in all the PF Changs as its a top seller\n\nPlease bring it back I am craving for it !\n\n\n===================================\nGuys, Guys...... don't just rate it bad because you had to wait a while, that is not being fair to the establishment.\n\nThe food here for the price, ambiance & tase is un paralleled in any chineese place that I have eaten in the area. I have been there so many times that I have lost count, I would say over 25 times...\n\nI have my favourites. Which are a must for anyone who wat to try the cream of the crop, at least for vegetarians.\n1. The veg Lettuce Wrap\n2. The vegatable soup ( The best soup I have had anywhere). It contains veg dumplings, plaintain chip fritters and beautifully presented with few green spinach, simply awsome ( my mouther waters thinking about it).\n3. Pan sheared Cucumbers with sesame seeds.\n4. Mapo Tofy with brocoli.\n\nLove the choice of mini desserts when you are over stuffed, or just live large with the full sized cheesecake. My wife simply loves the dragon tea so much that she nows buys the tea leaft online to make at home.\n\nThe Wine is also very reasonabally priced. My hats off to people who wait on people and take care of the guests. They are very, very knowedgable about the food & options and changes you can make. Simple one great place to be Anytime!\n\n\nOnly downside to all this is that if you show up at peak hours the wait can be painfully long, My experience has been that they always give you the upper end of the wait time so be patient, it takes less than they say it will take.\n\nI have had then say 2 hrs and the most i have waited has been 50 minutes. \n\nWhen you get an opportunity defintly try this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3W0WFoA9NNseW3ndEOdyLA"}
