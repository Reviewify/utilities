(+): authentic chinese food, fair prices (-): poor service, average food would i go back again? maybe once they work out the kinks and improve their service, but only if someone could recommend a specific dish to try.", "business_id": "7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-09-23", "type": "review"}
