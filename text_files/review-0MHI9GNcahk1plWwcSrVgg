The race ends in the LA Coliseum. As in, you literally run through the famous tunnel, onto the coliseum's huge football field and through this ridiculously overdone finish line, complete with a live band. I can't decide what's cooler, running into a stadium like this or running through the finish line of the Marine Corps Marathon where a uniformed marine placed a medal around my neck and then got down on his knees to remove the timing chip from my sweat-soaked shoe. \n\nThe reason being is that this is the very coliseum that Joan Benoit Samuelson glided into on her way to win the first women's olympic marathon in 1984--a place where history was made. Running through the very same tunnel that she ran through and onto that huge open football field was one of the most moving experiences I've had in a race. Trust me, you will be inspired by it too. Sign up, lace up your racing flats, and prepare to set a new PR!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dFgH_vDh6E&feature=fvw", "type": "review", "business_id": "q5nkUVL-k3hVMLIM7F8aGA"}
