It seems like I've been eating a lot of burrito bowls recently. not too sure why, but when Leighann F and I were trying to figure out a Harvard Square lunch option, Chipotle popped right in my head. I got a chicken burrito bowl with lime cilantro rice, corn salsa, hot sauce, lettuce, and black beans. The food was awesome; white meat chicken, flavorful but not too spicy salsa, and lime cilantro rice. I can see people having issues with the rice, because it seems like people either love or hate cilantro. Personally, I LOVE it. Compared to what I've had from authentic burrito joints, I wouldn't classify this as authentic. I'd certainly put it in the same class as Boloco, Qdoba, etc... all delicious but not \"real\" Mexican food. Only gripe- the food was SALTY. I have a high tolerance for salty food, but this was noticeably too salty. I'm not sure if all Chipotle locations is like this, but I'll certainly try another location and find out.", "business_id": "bFeUWWtFB_7b_0ODOduhMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-08", "type": "review"}
