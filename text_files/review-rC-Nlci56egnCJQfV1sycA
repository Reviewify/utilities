I've been there twice, since I attend the Le Cordon Bleu just a few blocks away.  First I tried the lamb pita wrap. The combination of flavors was completely off. \n\nNext, I tried the falafel, which was even worse.  The spices on it were so gross that I actually threw most of it away.  \n\nAlthough it's one of the few options close to my school for lunch, I'd rather go hungry than waste money on their food again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AHC01qlTiuHn-pHVQ_4DGQ"}
