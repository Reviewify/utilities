I seriously ate here at least once a week the whole time I was in school up there. Great food every time and a wonderful place to read a bit while sipping on awesome tea. I would have given it 5 stars if it had servers, but I still love the place in spite of my bias towards restaurants without waitresses.", "business_id": "xtyK6kDA4A2ASCVuU2vH7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-16", "type": "review"}
