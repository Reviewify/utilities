You have to have your parking ticket validated when you buy your movie ticket, then stand in line outside with everyone else in the theatre after your movie to pay for parking. If you forget to have your ticket validated, you're S.O.L. and have to pay $12 or something ridiculous...they won't even take your movie stub as proof you bought a ticket. I like the Landmark Embassy in Waltham better -- same movies, free parking, better popcorn, and Watch City Brewery next door!", "business_id": "b2yLnFM7tqv6b2VfQNSrlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-05", "type": "review"}
