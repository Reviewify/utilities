I mean I definitely wouldn't review a Pathmark in Union City or Shoprite... \n\nBut Wegman's has a flair that deserves a Yelp vote--\n\ntheir deserts, their breads, great supermarket selection, kosher options...\n\nTheir lunch options can be a LITTLE better... although they have an outside bbq ready-to-eat food-- I am not sure if they change around their items for lunch but the day I went, their hot options were mostly chinese (not very authentic flavors) and Indian (also not so authentic)... I've heard good things about salads and sandwiches so will probably do cold-type options next time- seems more Wegman's appropriate... \n\nnot sure if Betty and Bob (NOT stereotyping, just sayin') can cook Szechuan chicken the way I've had it in Chinatown\n\nAlso it must be warned that this place is no cheap option.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RCGryVRZqKvnDH4Yyhhe8w"}
