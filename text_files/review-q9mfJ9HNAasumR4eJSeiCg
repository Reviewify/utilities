There is only one lagging aspect: the ambiance !! Is to cold , there is no music to enhance the food qualities. Few speakers are buzzing an almost non audible sound , which I would like to believe that was music. The prices are mall prices a little to much, the wines are well overpriced for what they are. A little effort on this direction will create a perfect recipe for good intimate dinning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gIfMoCGnhuB6WL5o0ddqzw"}
