(we had kind of forgotten we didn't love it the first time but we both love fish tacos, so any time we see it on the menu, we have to order it!) there was a very fishy aftertaste that even the lime could not hide. we were piqued by the hearts of palm and thought that was such an interesting item to add, but in the end it was kind of blah and left us underwhelmed. the puerco en adobo was sooo salty. my boyfriend didn't think it was too salty but did think the flavor was a bit off. i generally love salt but this was just too much. i ended up adding a ton of hot sauce to both items to hide the taste of the food. to drink, we ordered a watermelon agua fresca and a fruit punch agua fresca. my boyfriend didn't love his watermelon agua fresca.. he thought the flavor was too subtle. the fruit punch agua fresca is tasty though. overall, we do have a pleasant experience as far as the atmosphere is concerned. but we just can't bring ourselves to do that to our taste buds again. i am willing to give this place one more chance to try their brunch. but i'll definitely pass on this place for lunch and dinner. sorry, cascabel, i did really really want to like you!", "business_id": "_5BoZ_C5zEl5M_MxT1W39w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-14", "type": "review"}
