The waiters do always seem to be new, but it's never bothered me.  I also tried some curry once and it was delicious, a little peanuty, but good.  I mean, this place is located on the drag, not downtown, so it's not going to be phenomenal...but for the location, it satisfies my sushi craving any day!", "business_id": "1k5e_3cnblV-UAtRCYGXaw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-14", "type": "review"}
