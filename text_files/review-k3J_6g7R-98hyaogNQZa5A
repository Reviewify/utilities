There Ethiopian beer and wine was really good.. But when it comes to the food...eehh dont know.. Order something that look like baby food place on a bed of bread.. It was like pureed meat and a hard boiled egg thrown right on top of it... Really did not enjoy the meal... The ambience is great.. But I am not an expert in Ethiopian food... I took couple of bites out of mine and my dates food.... We were both disappointed...  Don't think I will return here.... My curiosity on Ethiopian food out the window!", "business_id": "ySzkBv-_DTNT30eONPnAkg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-20", "type": "review"}
