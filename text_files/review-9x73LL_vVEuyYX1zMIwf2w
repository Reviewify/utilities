She works in Scarves and Jewelry at Nordstrom. She was just so incredibly helpful and polite, and she went above and beyond what I would expect of even superior customer service. She started off helping me trying  to find a blue scarf, and she helped me try and different colors and made suggestions about what would look best on me.  However, when she \nfound out that my real dilemma was that I had bought a scarf from Nordstrom a couple months ago and lost it.  And I had tried to call the \nonline customer service but was told that particular color was no longer made, completely out of stock, and there was no estimate on when (or if!) it would be made again.\n\nI had already spent several hours googling for the scarf...even looking on ebay for it!  No luck. So there I was last night trying to find \nsomething similar.  When Amy found out about this, she did not say, \"Oh, that is too bad.\" Instead, she went over to the computer, searched for the scarf and color, and started dialing around to stores to see if a store out there, anywhere, had the scarf. I was in shock.  I could not \nbelieve how tenacious and helpful she was!  And would you believe it...sure enough, first phone call, she found it!  We ordered it, she \neven waived the shipping for me, and it is now on its way to my home.\n\nI am just so in awe of how helpful and kind she was to me. I am so happy...I loved that scarf!  I told Amy she is absolutely awesome.  If you need some help in that particular department, ask for Amy Abbott!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ncEQCb2Wjk1XfxKxrQD2aQ"}
