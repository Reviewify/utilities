The prices are quite reasonable for a museum/tourist site cafe and the eating area is clean and welcoming. They also use biodegradable cups and forks, and compost their waste, which is nice to see. They also focus on organic, local food. Though my salad wasn't anything super special, it was tasty enough and I'd happily go back to support Phipps and its cafe.", "business_id": "EWswCV97BBb0ezXRZhCoOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-03", "type": "review"}
