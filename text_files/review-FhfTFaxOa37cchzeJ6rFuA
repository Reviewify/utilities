I can't believe people say this is their favorite place to eat--dingy space, spotty service, marginally acceptable food, the only reason I'd go back is if I'm really short on cash.  I got the Western omelette, it was basically a pile of veggies stir-fried with egg on the bottom, my friend's Eggs Benedict was just plain bad.  Not even the home fries were good.  I think the highlight of the meal was the buttered toast, and they also ran out of OJ when I went.  All in all, I'd rather go to Sunny's Diner than this place!", "business_id": "UZJ361wkdyZfxWax3oc3rg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-05-22", "type": "review"}
