It's the only place around with a beer garden, lots of coffee shops, every type of food you could possibly want, always a festival or block party happening in the summer, lots of eccentric stores, tattoo/piercing shops, capoeira exhibitions, artists, singers...and you never know what you will see there... My uncle was there for a couple weeks for an electric job on Friday evenings...he saw this woman walk by one evening with a rat on her shoulder.  The next Friday she was walking around with a snake around her neck.  Two weeks later he saw her walking around with a leash...attatched to some dude's neck collar as she took him for a walk.  Completely normal for Harvard Square. Oh, and wicked smaht Hahvad students there too.", "business_id": "UGs6J02mK_DTxDPfrJoviw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-23", "type": "review"}
