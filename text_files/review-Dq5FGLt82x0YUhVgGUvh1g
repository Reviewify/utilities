They were  delivered on time to the hotel as promised.  In less than 30 minutes the rose petals were falling off all the boutonnieres and one of the corsages.  The groom's boutonniere suffered the most loss of petals.  Mind you that we were all in an air conditioned environment and had not ventured out into the heat.  As we arrived at the church things got much worse.  You cannot imagine how embarassed I was to see my son standing at the altar with rose petals falling from his lapel.   \n\nThe bride's mother insisted on using artificial flowers for all their bouquets and corsages.  Now I understand why.  As I look at the wedding photos I have to agree with her decision.\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing boutonnieres or corsages and woud like roses may I suggest that you specifically ask for ROSE BUDS.  Otherwise you will receive fully bloomed roses that won't last a minute.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mHYaY4eCTRdCn23SPfWVQ"}
