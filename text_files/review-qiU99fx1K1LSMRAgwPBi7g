I've experienced better.\" is a perfect line to describe this place. Let's start with service. Not so friendly. It's a barbecue house, I was expecting more family oriented, friendly service but did not get anything close to it. The servers seemed like they could care less, we were checked up on one time throughout our meal, and even when giving us our food they simply just dropped it down and left. Maybe I'm being too critical because I work in a restaurant, but come on now. That's pretty basic waitressing to me. I wouldn't say rude, but it was definitely not good service. As for the food, it was okay. We had the family feast, which included 10 beef ribs, or pork ribs, or 2 chicken, or 3 lbs of beef, chicken and pork or something. Plus garlic bread, potato salad, and beans. Nothing outstanding, just average. Overall, not a great experience.
