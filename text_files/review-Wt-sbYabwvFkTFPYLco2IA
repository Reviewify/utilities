We were told that they don't take reservations, but we could call 30-45 minutes ahead to get our name on the list.  Asked if they did anything for birthdays, like \"sing or put a candle on dessert.\"  The hostess DIDN'T KNOW.  How do you work at a restaurant and not know this?  She put us on hold and was able to confirm that they do birthdays.  \nGot to restaurant 35 minutes after we called to get our name on the list.  The hostess looks at us and says \"Oh, the table with the birthday\".  Really?  How dense are you?  We then had to wait another 20 minutes for our table.  But we called ahead?  Headscratch.  \n\nWe ordered a lot of food.  \n- Duck Appetizer and Soup of the day.  Both pretty good.\n- Crispy Chicken - totally devoid of flavor\n- Short Ribs - grissly and kind of gross.  When we pointed this out to the waiter, he told us that was to be expected with their beef dishes?!\n- Beef noodles - pretty good.\n- Soju Jito - disgusting.  Couldn't finish this! \n- Chocolate Tapioca dessert.  No candle, no happy birthday or anything.  Thanks again for that.  We got stomach aches from the tapioca.  \n\nWould never go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}
