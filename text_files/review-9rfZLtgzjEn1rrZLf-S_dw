I was very skeptical when they first opened. Why would there be a line for pizza of all things?! I took a friend here when she was in town as a break from driving all over LA doing touristy things. I made my own pizza and it was delish! You pick your base, bianca (just cheese), marinara (just tomato sauce), margherita (cheese & tomato!), then add your toppings. I got shrimp and garlic. Yum. Ingredients are fresh. Pizzas cook fast because the crust is actually pretty thin. Too thin in the center if you ask me, but it tasted amazing nonetheless. I also wished they could've been a little more general with their toppings. I think two of my pizza slices actually didn't even have any shrimp on it! Oh wells. The line always looks long when I drive by, but I've managed to dodge it both times I was there.", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-11", "type": "review"}
