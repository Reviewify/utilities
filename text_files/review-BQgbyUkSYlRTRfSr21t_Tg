For the price, this place is 5 stars, easy.  I had the pig sandwich which is supposed to consist of different cuts of pork i think... but all could taste was a sandwich filled with deliciously tender and tasty BBQ pulled pork.  OMFG, the best BBQ pork sandwich ever.  My friends ordered: chicken sandwich, fries, and ribs.  I didn't try the chicken, fries were hot and crispy, ribs were tender but would be better with a spicy BBQ sauce.  It was very crowded on Saturday night, a lot of eye candy and cold outside.  They had a couple of fireplaces but they weren't on.  We had to sit outside and it was freezing but once the food came out i didn't notice the cold anymore it was excellent.  I recommend putting some mustard in the pig sandwich to give it a little more kick.  I'd totally come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w"}
