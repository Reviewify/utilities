If you're looking to experience what Princeton students experience, then OK, take your turn at Hoagie Haven. Its really just your basic Jersey sandwich shop, including the strong food odor that sticks to your clothes even after just a few minutes inside. They make huge cheap subs, just like lots of other similar places around here. They use Italian Peoples' bread, just like lots of other similar places around here. The fillings are pretty much like they are at lots of other similar places around here. They offer a selection of small and medium-sized bags of chips, and bottled drinks, just like lots of other similar places around here.", "business_id": "5G0Vy0N4H6c4eIGxb1JPSQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-05", "type": "review"}
