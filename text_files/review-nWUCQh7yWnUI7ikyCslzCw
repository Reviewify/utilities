If I weren't so lazy, I'd probably be here at least once a week. I've been coming here for years and they practically know my order and my friend's order by heart. They are so friendly and attentive (I don't think my water glass gets dry very often, if at all).  Their pad thai is so delicious and I love love love their crab rangoon and sweet sauce.  My friend loves their krathong thong appetizer, too, and their cashew chicken gets rave reviews as well.  This place is a complete hole in the wall, actually hole in the basement!  But it's a great find and if I ever leave Boston, I know this will be top of the list of places I'd miss most.  Definitely give them a try!", "business_id": "unE4t2dqs-05zXZmGxlawA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}
