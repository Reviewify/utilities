The only reason this place is in business for so many years are Princeton students. I think chef in this place is Indian. I ordered panang curry and i had to send it back. Beef was boiled to make it tender, curry did not even taste as panang and was hardly any. My husband had duck salad and it was simply disgusting. Dried up bits of duck, pineapple from the can and green apple instead of papaya. And fish sauce was poured over. The only reason we ended up in this place, really good thai place on Harrison was closed on Monday. Don't waste your money in this place.", "business_id": "lx7wE8QpkwLekV7lcjWmXg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-06", "type": "review"}
