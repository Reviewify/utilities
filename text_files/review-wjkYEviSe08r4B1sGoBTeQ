Its cozy and the patio is the best spot around on warm days and nights. Everyone raves about the burgers, but every time I go I get the turkey club on french bread. When made by the dreadlocked girl (what's her name?) it is heaven on earth. She is a sandwich making goddess. If someone else is in the kitchen, its almost as tasty. They are usually understaffed so service is slow, but its the kind of place to chill and take your time, so no big deal. An added bonus, Stella beer always comes with a Stella glass, which makes it all the more enjoyable. They must be perpetually stocked. Which reminds me, people, stop stealing Stella glasses from bars!", "business_id": "XlcWm3OdV1QrSPF_AwrlTQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-25", "type": "review"}
