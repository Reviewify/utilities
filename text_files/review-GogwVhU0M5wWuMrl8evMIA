I usually get my hair cut by the Korean lady.  I like that she's never in a rush to get through the haircut.  She takes her time, like she actually cares.  Consequently, I consistently get a good cut.  It also helps that she's close to campus, and not very expensive.  Great value!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Mw_IkXUlEWhcnT8UEuIViw"}
