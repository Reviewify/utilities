I've visited this establishment on a number of occasions and have with each additional visit become so positively underwhelmed that I do not think I can even try it again. My most recent visit was with my husband and another couple. The visual atmosphere is ok, though the restaurant is really dark. The music is bizarre at best and always makes for a weird sensation. I've not heard any Indian music in my last few visits and this time there was actually metal playing at one point. I'm not keen on the service either. I have a real sore spot for upsellers. I don't want to be told that I'm ordering naan or appetizers or 2 orders of something, as it makes me, the customer, have to be disagreeable with the server. I understand the tactic but believe it to be rude and untoward. Lastly,--and possibly most importantly--the food is not very good. The curries are spiced but are missing something and to my palette taste bland and boring. The portion size is ok but the entrees are overpriced. To make matters worse, they somehow are able to make the driest, most bland Galub Jamun I think I've ever tasted. Nothing to see here; take your taste buds elsewhere.", "business_id": "4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-22", "type": "review"}
