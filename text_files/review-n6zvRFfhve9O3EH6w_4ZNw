I was surprised on how few Mexican restaurants are located in this area. Jose Malones is a great restaurant. It is not your typical Mexican fare. It is a fusion of Irish/Mexican. More Mexican than Irish. I had the short ribs and they were very good. The steak fajitas were cooked to perfection. Usually they are over cooked but these still had a little pink onthe inside. The chips and salsa were good. The salsa good stand a little more spice. After 13 years in New Orleans I need a little heat! The Margarita was very good. I am not a huge Margarita guy but this oe had a lot of flavor. The drink is a little small but very good. It seems like Troy is becoming the place to go out for drinks and dinner. I would definetly add this to one of your viists to Troy.", "business_id": "zz687K2lR21YNwsv455Dqw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-16", "type": "review"}
