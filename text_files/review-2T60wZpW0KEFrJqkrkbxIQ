We have been about 3x since then and it dosent dissappoint.  The restaurant drips sex appeal as the waitress' are all dressed in roaring 20's flapper costumes and are right into character as soon as you walk in.\n\nFood is OK, great place for meeting up with friends!\n \nGreat experience and will continue going. \nOnly bad points go for extremely expensive cocktails (and Martinis).\n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "C7FKNwSUlbUinT9cRSLXHA"}
