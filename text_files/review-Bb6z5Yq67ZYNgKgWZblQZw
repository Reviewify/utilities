Their food was excellent and definitely has a kick to it.  My husband had the jerk chicken and I had the chicken curry with the roti on the side.  For dessert, I wanted to try the cassava cake, which was still good even if I heated it up in our hotel room microwave.", "business_id": "n4A61MWiTz6ZpiUBVQLcjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}
