They have been erroneously charging me for months and the staff continues to say it is just a billing error and they will correct it: but they don't!  This is intentional to stall for time in order to continue to charge my account.  Finally, I had to notify my bank of the fraudulent charges and  cancel that card.  I believe that Soleil has a pattern of unethical business practices.  I caution you to put everything in writing with them and have his staff sign it.....  The staff at the Berkeley location continues to assure me that I would be refunded but that they don't manage the billing and that the owner will have to correct it and that I need to send and email to the owner.  After weeks of emails and calls, I STILL HAVE NOT received a response.  Please spend your money elsewhere.", "business_id": "b7ElLAl_fHUAFDRMD36Eeg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-09", "type": "review"}
