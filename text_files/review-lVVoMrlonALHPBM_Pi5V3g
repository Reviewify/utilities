I was in Seattle for 3 days and came here on recommendation from my roommates. Ate here twice, plus picked up 4 entrees to go when I left town. This place is a total experience! Dark, moderately hot, filled with delicious aromas. Some people can't handle the flaming wok, eh? Dilletantes! It is part of the experience! \n\nSwimming Rama: best with fried tofu. \nGreen Chicken Curry: also awesome. \nWide Noodles in Thai sauce: Badass, too!\nPhad Thai: Looking forward to it\nDeep fried tofu appetizer: could eat this for the rest of my life. \n\nThis place is the intersection of awesomeness, flavour, and price in Thai food. I have paid WAY more, pretty much at any other Thai restaurant, for inferior taste.\n\nIf you want somewhere to have a quiet, candle-lit dinner with your sweetie, this isn't the place for that, so don't knock it. They seat ~20 people at a time, so don't be surprised that they are fans of rapid turnover.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}
