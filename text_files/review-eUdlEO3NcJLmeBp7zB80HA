Crappy service and their food is pretty barftacular too. Never again. Edit 3/12/07 - Ok after stating \"never again\" on Saturday morning, where did I find myself Saturday night? UGH. We only went there due to my bf's family being in town and the CBC's brewers dinner was sold out. Yet again, this place let me down. They stuck us out in the area by the door where you first come in. They *still* have not fixed their door since the last time I was there (over a year ago). Every time someone comes in, the door doesn't close all the way, giving us an arctic blast and forcing us to jump up and close the door due to the servers not giving a shit. My bf's mother's dinner came out STONE COLD, so she sent it back. They brought out another burger, and her medium rare burger had been transformed into a burnt well done patty. Hey, at least it was warm, right? I ordered the scallops, what a let down - there were maybe 6 scallops total. LAME. When I say \"never again\" I mean it this time. Did I mention the service is shitty? I wish I could give this place negative stars.", "business_id": "SfWZsocz-eqeYO1YOvkPiw", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-03-12", "type": "review"}
