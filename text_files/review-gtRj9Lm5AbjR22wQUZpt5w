Walking in, you're greeted by over sized pine plank floors and furniture that is a combination of rustic-Mission and modern. There is a grand bifurcated counter, the right side features made to order salads and the left side features flatbed pizza and panini sandwiches. Some of the great items on the made-to-order salad station include figs, pears, gorgonzola, and anchovies! The flatbed pizzas feature roughly 10-12 different varieties, their Margherita Pizza is amazing! Quick, great quality, and very filling! If you are on campus near the biomedical / hospital / research buildings - check them out! You won't regret it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "4tgm6KADoZz_hbukxqK7sA"}
