You see lots of students coming in and out for the daily specials.\n\nI ordered falafel and red lentil soup. The soup was very flavorful and well seasoned! I also had an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie which was just alright. \n\nI enjoyed the peace and quiet while I used the comp wi-fi. \n\nTip: Make sure you bring cash because theirs a minimum to use debit.  However, the kind owner waved the charge for me. The service was great.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T1ugJiVm210G_4QvmQCz1g"}
