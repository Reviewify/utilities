You see lots of students coming in and out for the daily specials. I ordered falafel and red lentil soup. The soup was very flavorful and well seasoned! I also had an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie which was just alright. I enjoyed the peace and quiet while I used the comp wi-fi. Tip: Make sure you bring cash because theirs a minimum to use debit. However, the kind owner waved the charge for me. The service was great.", "business_id": "T1ugJiVm210G_4QvmQCz1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-17", "type": "review"}
