It would normally receive 4 stars but I have a tradition of going here with friends who wanna just sit and talk. For that sentimental value I have I add a star. Prices are great, food is amazing, and the atmosphere is nice kinda quiet (soft music usually in the background).  I love the artwork and the food. I almost always get the Thai House Noodles. It's a mix of vegetables, beef, chicken, shrimp, noodles and a hodge podge of other delicious things. That with a glass of their very delicious Thai Iced Tea. You'd be set. I usually just barely finish the meal but more often than not I take left overs home. The price is usually between $6-9 for the plates. The service is great and the people are very nice.  Everytime I got with a friend the total for 2 people has never been more than about 25 dollars.
