I enjoyed the spontaneity of it, and especially the Reverse Q&A that brought Brandon's recent blind date onstage, much to her embarrassment!  My favorite stories included \"reply to college rejection letter\" and \"Asian mother guilt\".  Brandon's songs also told stories, and among my faves was one about a dysfunctional typical American family.  \n\nMy boyfriend ended up winning the grand prize for bingo, a complimentary CD of Inverness, an up-and-coming band.  Other audience members eagerly played bingo, to win a cup of pudding and some other toy.  \n\nThe show was spirited and fun.  I'd go again, it's sure to be different the second time around!  The show's intimate and spontaneous nature also reminded me of Ghetto Gourmet, and so I invited Brandon to perform for a recent dinner (which he did).  How cool was that?", "type": "review", "business_id": "DxyqiEQF_AP_YsuBWcFnjQ"}
