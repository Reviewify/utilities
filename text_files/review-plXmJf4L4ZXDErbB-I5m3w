You've never failed not to disappoint me with your food. This is NOT real Mexican food.   This is what is called \"Fresh-Mex\".   The food is made right in front of you, you can customize it pretty well.      The chain goes out of their way to be socially responsible, which is an added plus.    The chicken, beef, and pork are usually very good, as is the rice and the chili-corn salsa.    (I don't get beans or green death, so they usually add extra meat or rice) The chips are pretty good too, though they usually need extra salt. For the last time though, this chain is NOT OWNED BY MCDONALDS IN ANYWAY, SHAPE, OR FORM!!     McDonalds had a stake in it, and eventually sold their share.   Far cry from the people swearing that it was owned by McD's.       And even if it was, it wouldn't change the fact that the place (and chain) is really pretty good. The U District one is one of the better ones.   Lynnwood is also pretty good.  Bellevue is iffy though.", "business_id": "wE-gNIBhkmxDv5f50rRX7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-11-21", "type": "review"}
