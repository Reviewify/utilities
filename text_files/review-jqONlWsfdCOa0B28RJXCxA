They have a nice bbq flavor.  I like adding the toppings of my choice.  This is a good place to stop in and have a burger on a summer afternoon and talk with friends and family.  The only thing I will say is that this restaurant needs a make over - the flooring, booths, paint  and chairs.  Just a little update will push this place over the top.  Keep all the community team photos they are great!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "wooEclt2BfKBd16uqgrYeA"}
