I love this place and I have gotten a lot of great buys i.e. Miu Miu bag, Trina Turk dresses, and Yigal pants.  I was there a few days ago looking around and I saw they Gucci, Prada and (whoa) new Manolo Blahnik shoes for $120.00!!!  I am really surprised about how good the prices are here and  another BIG plus is that everyone who works there is super nice :-)", "business_id": "StSMu18FhPl20L3MS_kgGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-02", "type": "review"}
