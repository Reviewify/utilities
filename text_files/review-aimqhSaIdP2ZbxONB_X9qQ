(it's good sh!t man. several of the elves got hooked on it and actually d.o.ed!) in addition, the cast consisted of a sluty pregnant elf, a little boy (played by a girl) who didn't believe in christmas, rudolf the rednosed reindeer as a jock superstar, santa of course, and the supporting actors. the narrator a was a middle aged, slush of a housewife stuck in the 80's with 80's hair and 80's clothes. the last three shows (maybe more) were completely sold out. we waited in line to snatch up any open seats and were rewarded with our patience. i had such a good time and i recommend to everyone to go and see anything that yellow tape construction does.", "business_id": "POwKo0nQGvv2EBHEr6v0vw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-04", "type": "review"}
