I think this was an event listed here on Yelp that turned me on to them. It was the Ultimate Christmas Musical- The Musical. Since they are a local theater troupe, I had very low expectations going into it, however, they BLEW ME AWAY. Not only was the story well performed, it was well written, funny, engaging, it was all around awesome. There wasn't the dragging third act, over use of clichs, shotty acting, or forgotten lines. The story was adult, contemporary, and funny. Since this is Austin you have to have live music, am I right? Well they did, a complete band, but that's not all! The piano player dressed as Frosty the Elvis Snowman was also a supporting actor who sold his drug, dis-belief. (It's good sh!t man. Several of the Elves got hooked on it and actually D.O.ed!) In addition, the cast consisted of a sluty pregnant elf, a little boy (played by a girl) who didn't believe in Christmas, Rudolf the Rednosed Reindeer as a jock superstar, Santa of course, and the supporting actors. The narrator a was a middle aged, slush of a housewife stuck in the 80's with 80's hair and 80's clothes. The last three shows (maybe more) were completely sold out. We waited in line to snatch up any open seats and were rewarded with our patience. I had such a good time and I recommend to everyone to go and see anything that Yellow Tape Construction does.", "business_id": "POwKo0nQGvv2EBHEr6v0vw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-04", "type": "review"}
