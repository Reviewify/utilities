How anyone could drink out of their filthy glasses is beyond me.  I also once sat in the back and there were a ton of flies.  It kind of smelled like garbage back there!\n \nThe only drink I would order is beer in a bottle.  Otherwise you will have a 20 year old dirty plastic cup to drink out of.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5rTrfWtd1Isl0v8OK_iiCw"}
