Owner and staff are nice. Get your food to go because the restaurant is disgusting. How anyone could drink out of their filthy glasses is beyond me. I also once sat in the back and there were a ton of flies. It kind of smelled like garbage back there! The only drink I would order is beer in a bottle. Otherwise you will have a 20 year old dirty plastic cup to drink out of.", "business_id": "5rTrfWtd1Isl0v8OK_iiCw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-18", "type": "review"}
