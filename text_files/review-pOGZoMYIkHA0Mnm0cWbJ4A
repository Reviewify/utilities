Anyway--endless chai! One of the best features and true to their word, they keep your cup full. Their naan is also very tasty. Spinach, garlic....all wonderful. I love any of their curries, Chicken tandori Tika? Love it. I've always had good service, despite their rushes and/or slow time. \nOh, i've had their mango Lassi's and they are pretty wonderful as well. If you go, go to enjoy the endless chai, the naan and just the experience of eating Indian & Mediterranean food. Most of the reviewers are saying that only their naan was memorable, so go without super high expectations. \nIf you are in the area, enjoy it. It is one of the many locally owned restaurants in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg"}
