It's great for lunch, has a fun atmosphere and the staff is all so friendly. If you can't decide on what to order for your sides, no problem they will give you some samples! I've tried most of their menu and have loved it all! I had never eaten kale before coming here and now I get the kale every time - it's delicious. One of my favorite sandwiches is the falafel. MMMMM!!! Everything tastes so fresh and be sure to get their orange, mint, limeade drink - it's so good and refreshing!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VQZF4hu7faCkUaJ9RDRpeQ"}
