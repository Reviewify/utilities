DAMN, that looked good. I'm getting that next time and just wanted to pass this bit of info along.  Community Food & Juice has a shot at becoming the primo place to dine in the Columbia U. n'hood.  The decor is very woodsy and chic, with funky lamps, big windows and a bar that invites solo dining and wine tasting.  The burger was pretty damn good (not Back 40-good, but tasty nevertheless). The salmon rice bowl also got high marks from date.  I'd say most entrees looked good to me: I'll be back for the diver scallops, the steak of the day (ancho-chile crusted rib eye this past Saturday) and the fried chicken.  My only criticisms were that the kegs weren't working so the only beer on tap was Wolavers. And they ran out of the fish of the day (striped bass) at 9.30pm on a Saturday night.  Aside from these minor pains in the asses, Community Food & Juice is pretty solid and I'll definitely be back.", "business_id": "8lLs3dsSN-Am2_EtNfbXqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-28", "type": "review"}
