I can't speak to the food or anything during the day but on Thursday nights it didn't get any better. My friends and I would get there early and commandeer the same table behind/under the dance floor and dance all night long. There's always some beer/drink special going on so you can get ridiculously wasted for $10 or so dollars. If i ever burned through a $20 it was a baaaaad night. I have nothing but fond memories...unfortunately I'm a little too old now :(", "business_id": "ZEHx7DVqZpH2Z__DqdH4yg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-14", "type": "review"}
