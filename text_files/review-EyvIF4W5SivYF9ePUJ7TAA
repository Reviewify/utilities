But I get to the counter and the two employees are talking crap while ringing me up. The one girl was complaining like \"look at what someone just left in the dressing room!\" and the other girl was like \"wow, they just left them all crumpled like that?\" Then the girl goes to paint her nails at the counter! Even before that, she was giving me attitude about how they don't have half sizes for shoes and how accessories are nonreturnable. Can a customer not ask questions?
