Especially if you are VSP member.  He sucks.  I typically check for yelp reviews and didnt this time.  BIG Mistake.  If I would have read the bad reviews, I would not have visited this office and spared myself the WORST experience ever and a major HIGH blood pressure rush because it took a whole lot of patience trying to talk with this guy.  He's rude. 1- his office is a HOT MESS.  papers everywhere. empty eyeglass cases. hot mess. totally disorganized. 2- he is extremely rude and outdated. told me my last optometrist had my prescription all wrong.  umm... love the glasses from my previous doc & i still wear them and they work FANTASTIC. 3- extremely defensive.  do NOT question him. the customer is never right with this guy... he is right, you are wrong. 4- did i mention how RUDE he is?  answers the phone during the exam instead of focusing on you as the patient. 5- disrespectful.  that's all i say about that because god don't like ugly & I'm not trying to ruin my karma. Good Luck on your OD search and spare yourself a having to spend time writing a bad review on yelp because your experience was so horrendous w/larry phillips. By the way, my experience was so horrible, VSP re-instated my benefits and gave me 60days to go somewhere else and not pay for a 2nd office visit to a new optometrist.", "business_id": "WsBzQEF6C1sCaO5e4vi53w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-08-09", "type": "review"}
