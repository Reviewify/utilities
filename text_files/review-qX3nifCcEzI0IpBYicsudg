An extensive wine list and a very Northern California winery vibe leads you to forget your in the middle of West Los Angeles.  The appetizers are tasty and a steal at happy hour (half price) along with a nice wine list like I said. The kobe beef  corn dogs are delicious and the appetizer that really sticks out.  Service here was so/so, it took us forever to get anything including the check and we were their when the place was hardly busy so no excuses could really be made. This forced me to remove a star from their rating.  My other problem is parking in Westwood, forget about it! Unless your looking to dine on a weekday at 10pm you won't have an easy time parking. Shoot for Happy Hour attendance only as I couldn't imagine paying double the price for the food we ordered.", "business_id": "HsrBr49livt6XtKbEzuHnQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-31", "type": "review"}
