If I still lived near this place, I would be here all the time.  It is so damn cheap, with just the right portions for someone who needs savory and sweet dishes.  I usually get half of an eggs benedict with one choco chip pancake.  This is the only place that does a benedict combo with pancake or french toast!!!  All brunch places should do this.  Why don't they!?  Now I have to order a whole benedict and whole pancake item like a fatty and box up the rest to go. I like sitting out on the deck.  It doesn't get much more chill than a wknd brunch on Cafe Durant's deck, watching people below.  I think the three star ratings should really be four... people aren't thinking about how cheap this place is.  To be fair, they don't make a real benedict; their egg is fried not poached.  For the price, though, who cares?  It's still an egg.", "business_id": "BOCJ5g4q1RhP8wikwwr3Ow", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-14", "type": "review"}
