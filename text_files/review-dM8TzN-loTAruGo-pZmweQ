Today, there were larger than usually and DRY!  One slap on the wrist...one star taken away. =P 5/21/07: No meal at the Durant Food Court is complete without a stop to KPD, my favorite donut spot. You take a good whiff of their sugary goodness as you walk by and you simply cannot resist going in. Their perfect little donut holes are EVIL!! You can seriously scarf down more that dozen and then realize you've consumed the equivalent of two or three donuts. You feel sick to your stomach, but yet it's sooooo satisfying.  King Pin definitely reigns over KK!", "business_id": "Ugm1SowBaUq-M6nfg2LlRw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-05-21", "type": "review"}
