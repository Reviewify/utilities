Apparently, there are actual restaurants in LA! So cool!\n\nFor those who know nothing about these Mongolian noodle places: everyone gets a standard size bowl. Then you load it up with all the meats and vegetables you want without overspilling. At Mongols, the staff will then top your bowl with noodles and sauces, and lastly, stir fry everything in the huge open grill. \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ?select=11PkjDT7RpWm044j9sJYqA)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ?select=oIrdpbSOMifesdfo3xPKBA)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ?select=Ya8YLcr_iywGfISS_CKYCw)\n\nThe best part about this (at least for me) is seeing how much ingredients you can pile on. This is where creativity and physics come into play. My sister and I spend about 10 minutes working on our tower. We asked the worker to give us extra noodles, even though we knew we won't be able to finish it. Our dish came out almost twice as big! Haha. Yum!!\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ?select=p2UHAII-hr77DEfDXWPmig)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ?select=5hdAp6lReq4a9Ka4kXRCPA)", "type": "review", "business_id": "T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ"}
