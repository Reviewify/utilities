My old barber was great but he charged too much and is located pretty far away from where I live. So I figured okay why not try this place, the prices are cheap and they are close. Worth a try right? ....wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong the people in the store are very friendly, I must admit. Though I'm not sure they understand \"black\" people hair all too much. I went in just wanting to get my hair cut down a inch or so and then lined up. Not too difficult right? The lady there, without even asking how I want my hair, complete screws up my hairline making it look like an m instead of a straight line like this ________. To add to injury she gives me a buzz cut and makes me look like I enlisted in the army. So I have a f**ked up hairline, and I'm bald....great combination. I had a date later that day and felt oh so beautiful...thank you World Cuts.\n\n1.78/5, definitely will NOT be going here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PV8fnUeWP1-yoZ3y3lnu3w"}
