It's not bad for the price (and the location), but for the real thing, I'd rather head to Chinatown to Pho Pasteur (no relation to the old name of Le's.) My biggest pet peeve, was being rushed through our meal. The appetizer had been on the table for about a minute before the entrees arrived. At the same time, our order of tea took us asking about four times (and arriving wrong once) before it came halfway through the meal. If you go though, especially with a group, sit in the small downstairs area. It's much much cuter and it's way easier to have a conversation.", "business_id": "V7z-P1aqxkHTcKAsWA603A", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-03-21", "type": "review"}
