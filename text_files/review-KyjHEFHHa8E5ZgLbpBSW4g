I had the spicy chicken deluxe with fries. It was delicious. The chicken tasted fresh and moist. It wasn't chewy or have veins...gross. And it was actually spciy. Other places do the spicy chicken thing, but it just tastes like someone threw some black pepper on a chicken sandwich. Not here, nope it is got a little bit of kick to it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Fs7lKMANuifCyDjF99opRA"}
