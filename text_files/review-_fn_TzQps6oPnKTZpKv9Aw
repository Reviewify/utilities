Things to like: the coffee is great. the ambience makes me feel like brunch in Brooklyn (and that is a very good thing) The food is good and carefully prepared. Cons: Too expensive for what it is. service is hit and miss.  Sometimes it is great!  Sometimes it is...chilly. This is where we always go for brunch with out of town guests.", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}
