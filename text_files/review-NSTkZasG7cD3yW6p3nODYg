Maybe it's just a bump in the road. Maybe......maybe not.\nWe arrive and go for our usual exciting at the bar. Steve greets us with a smile and gets the perfect wine for us. The wine is great, perfect pairing for our order, Brassato for me and the seafood special for her. Thenwe start sliding down that long hill to the village of sadness and disappointment. Steve drops a roll on my plate. It's pumpernickel, and it's cold. What? What tha...My wifes is cold as well. And hard...like yesterday-maybe-I was-baked hard. Not even fresh. Then when I started to look around, I noticed a huge flat screen TV behind me. Normally, that would fit in my favorite sports bar, but it just doesn't fit in here and frankly, the owner should know that. That fact that he doesn't, is disappointing. \nThen our meal came. Mine was very fatty and lacking in flavor. My wife was also somewhat let down. \nThe main chef is gone, but there are still very good chefs here, so what gives? Could there be a lack of kitchen leadership? IS there a head chef now, I never thought to ask.\nI'll wait a while before returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0jQI7AktAB-m_cg54wY0aw"}
