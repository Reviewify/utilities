Even on just a plain old sandwich, the bread is tasty (and there are several choices), they toast it, the condiments are quality and well-applied, the fillings are tasty and the portions are generous. The whole menu is on their website, but my favorites are the chicken/pesto/portabello/mozzarella sandwich, the teriyaki roll-up, the lasagna, the HUGE calzones (it's the same as the pizza but folded), the Autumn Salad (pear, pecan, blue cheese, etc), and...well, everything I've had rocked! The frozen yogurt is lovely. No fake ingredients or flavored syrups either - what you see on the menu is what you get - real fruits/berries, candy bars, etc. ! All my experiences with the staff have been great too.", "business_id": "9iOUTtKt67ivBxCo-MlawA", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-07-01", "type": "review"}
