We pulled into FAL SAL's because we happened to notice that it was open so early in the morning, thank god because if it wasn't it would've been MCDs. We decided to go with their BBQ CHICKEN/BACON sandwich and their seasoned fries. The sandwiches were freshly made, the bread was grilled on the same grill that the chicken and bacon were grilling on (BACON FLAVORED BREAD RULES) which made it more seasoned. The chicken was flavorful and not dry at all, bacon was CRISP (maybe they might've thrown in in a deep fryer with our backs turned...I dont mind) and their secret/bbq sauce was very tangy and flavorful. Fries were fried to order and seasoned right in front of you. As we were leaving we couldn't help but notice their signature sandwiches on their menu and couldn't believe the amount of things that go into them ie.CHEESE STICKS, FRIES, BACON, TATOR TOTS etc. Of course our first time luck we noticed that AFTER we inhaled our sandwich, yet gave us ANOTHER REASON to come back for another heart attack between to slices of bread *KNOCK ON WOOD*. FAT SAL'S REALLY DELIEVERED!", "business_id": "txH67ORSC9m_3F_ZVqoXwg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-20", "type": "review"}
