They do have a full menu but what you'll want are the cupcakes. Every single cupcake I've had except the Portuguese sweet bread cupcake has been amazing. \n\nThe problem is the lack of staff. The first time I went there was one waitress and I believe the owner serving. We had to wait a pretty long time for service. We then went back the Sunday night afterward and the place was halfway packed and only the owner was on duty. We didn't even get a chance to get anything to drink with our cupcakes because he never came around. I completely understood that he was busy but if the place is busy, hire more staff. \n\nThe place is awesome and I will definitely go back but they really need more people working the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BbkF6j51IbcX-ed1f-bnhA"}
