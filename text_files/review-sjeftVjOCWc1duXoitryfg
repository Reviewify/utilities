I had the Joffre E. Vikas Malbec and it was fantastic. The atmosphere here is really cool as well as the decor. We came for an appetizer before dinner and ordered the calamari which was delicious. The martini menu is full of tasty concoctions and the wine list has a great variety to choose from. I can't wait to come back again for dinner!", "business_id": "aPdz29vOWj4fBlLlCBM7UQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-01", "type": "review"}
