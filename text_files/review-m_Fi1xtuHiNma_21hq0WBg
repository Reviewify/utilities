Also really bummed about all the hydrolyzed yeast extract, soy, wheat, canola, milk and other additives they have been putting in their hot and cold food bars right under people's noses. Am I the only one who notices this!!!!?\n\nNestor and Blair in the prepared foods make the best burrito in La Jolla (try it on just spinach, no tortilla) and I love that they have free wifi as well. They get 4 stars because, well they just have the absolute best selection of organic and hard to find foods that promote health. Still low-fat and sugar filled aisles but the savy shopper can rest easy, at least it's not VONS or Ralphs (ugh)", "type": "review", "business_id": "cWUiqqkS4cpi_StZWkk-Qw"}
