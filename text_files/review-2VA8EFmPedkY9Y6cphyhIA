Try the malai kofta, which is the best of its kind I've tasted in Boston. Plenty of south indian food, too, which is unusual, and an array of interesting selections from other parts of India. \n\nWarm, discreet atmosphere, good service. Prices are reasonable for a sit-down place, and with every order you get rice and a little bowl of lentil soup -- the portions are plenty large.\n\nThe lunch buffet is a little bland for my taste, though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cA1dMq-Ewrwo4QUR8_O8lg"}
