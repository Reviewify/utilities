I'm so sorry to have bothered you with my simple order of iced coffee. Next time I'll keep my money & buy two regular priced coffees elsewhere. So disappointing when you walk in somewhere with a huge smile, friendly attitude & are (barely) greeted with a \"what are YOU doing in here?\" attitude. The iced (where was the ice?) coffee.. took the guy about 10 minutes to make (with only one other person waiting for some sugary drink & two people working on it) waste of time. No bonus points, whatsoever. If you're into bland, over priced, pretentious.. this is your place.", "business_id": "M84iZIPcvtAq37vNpHU0vA", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-05-26", "type": "review"}
