The food has been good with decent portions, at a decent price.  I've twice now had a panini and it's been tasty.  My only complaint is that sometimes I don't want designer ketchup that tastes a little too close to the cold tomato soup that I get alongside the sandwich.  Fries taste good in ketchup, not tomato puree (which I realize is what ketchup is, but whatever).\n\nThe drinks have been great and the service is very attentive.  I'm sad that I'm moving out of the Tech Square area because I can see this place becoming a mainstay in my bar rotation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2WXwWfhpfia7_UflDYnUyQ"}
