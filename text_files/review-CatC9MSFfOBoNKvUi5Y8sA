When they changed ownership, I noticed that the food took a nosedive. The rice was not completely cooked, the curry was too salty, and the chicken overcooked. I had previously rated the new Tyson Bee's as poor, then edible, and now I must say that the kinks have been ironed out. I've upgraded the yellow curry to good. Because it is good. It's not the same as the old yellow curry, but I can live with that. It's still a little salty, but if they work on making it less so, I'd give it four stars. You did good, new owners.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F48wjJ_jjEz59Prh20XhRA"}
