(do i need to point out that main st is not in ireland?) second of all, this is a bar. most bars start a little geeky, get fun for a couple hours, and end drunkenly and sloppy. if you don't like the 3rd stage, go home early, eh? that being said, conor's is a great place to get a drink, bump into old friends (possibly meet new ones, for some), and have some fun. i don't think irish pubs were ever meant to be anything other than that. haute cuisine? i think not. polite and philosophical discourse? not too often. good times, good friends, good cheer? always!", "business_id": "Hc3d_UDV7qE30o6WeQBEmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-09", "type": "review"}
