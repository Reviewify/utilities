First of all, if you want authentic Irish food, it's probably best to actually GO to Ireland. (do I need to point out that Main St is NOT in Ireland?) Second of all, this is a bar. Most bars start a little geeky, get fun for a couple hours, and end drunkenly and sloppy. If you don't like the 3rd stage, go home early, eh? That being said, Conor's is a great place to get a drink, bump into old friends (possibly meet new ones, for some), and have some fun. I don't think Irish pubs were ever meant to be anything other than that. Haute cuisine? I think not. Polite and philosophical discourse? Not too often. Good times, good friends, good cheer? ALWAYS!", "business_id": "Hc3d_UDV7qE30o6WeQBEmQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-09", "type": "review"}
