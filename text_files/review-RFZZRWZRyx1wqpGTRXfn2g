Food is absolutely excellent and very fresh.  Even the dessert, a chocolate lava cake...  simply divine.  I tried the spicy spaghetti, kimchi rice and egg rolls.    \n\nI only knocked off one star as the service was quite a bit sluggish.  When eating spicy dishes, it would have been nice if the waiteress was just a wee bit more attentive keeping the water glass filled (10 minutes would go by and the glass would still be empty).  Otherwise, well worth the trip and I will be definitely coming back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oSMpVfjLeSDV2yZzNH0rKw"}
