I saw three groups of people get in fights with the management because of this! This being said it was pretty entertaining. When we finally got set, we were starving, but the food just didn't match up to our expectations. The catfish was good, but the grits sucked and the fried green tomatoes were horrible. Also, the server forgot my mac and cheese, which I forgot about because there was so much food. But then when the bill came out he still charged us and gave us a \"stern talking to\" about telling servers whether we received everything or not. What? You're telling me I need to tell you how to do your job? OK, I see how it is, now go get my fixed bill so I can bounce. Thx.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zNqQSYafieEgxB2nZ8yAFQ"}
