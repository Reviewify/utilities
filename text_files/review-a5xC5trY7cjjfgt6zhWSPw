As a beer dispensing establishment, this place is perfect.  The waitresses and bartenders have always been friendly and service is prompt.  Sitting outside on the patio with a beer in the afternoon is a great way to unwind.  Plus the running club associated with the bar is fun to hang out with and there are a lot of great people associated with it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OZ-GCbwkmQjz5LmsSUG8GA"}
