However, the back abbey burger is, honestly, the best burger I have ever had. The meat is of really high quality, and melts in your mouth; the bun is wonderful (and glistening, but not in a bad way), and the burger includes, among other things, caramelized onions and bleu cheese. It's so rich that I am rarely able to finish it, but truly unbelievable. It's understandable, yet unfortunate, that it costs twelve dollars. I have been told by many that the fries are fantastic, yet I'm not able to comment. Of course, as a gastropub, they also have an immense selection of beer, for the enthusiast.", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-01", "type": "review"}
