(tarna and shawerma). we went with the chicken and it did not disappoint. it came with 2 pieces of pita bread, sliced chicken, salad/tomatoes, and some type of paste that had a unique flavor. this place was great and next time i'll be trying the beef plate at the montebello location. good eats!", "business_id": "EMXF_jbhx_GNniMnG0uNVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-10", "type": "review"}
