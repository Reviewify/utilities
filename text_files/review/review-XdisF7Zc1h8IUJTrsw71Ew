(aka as it was said before they have no clue what a water pitcher is...) everything u read about the bad reviews is so true (rushing customers, not putting in right orders, skimping on the rice and then charging u extra for a lil more, and blank angry stares) on my most recent experience, i did not even get to eat. i made sure to find out their hours and rushed over after work getting there a half hour before they closed at 10. i barely walked thru the door when they exclaimed they were closed. i then asked if i could get carryout and they said no. what is the point of having hours of business (that keep getting smaller) when you are not going to keep them? *on a side note my friend was actually already eating in there, and she said that after i left some people came in and ordered take out* didn't think it was true, but guess only their fellow indian friend's get the good service...", "business_id": "PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-13", "type": "review"}
