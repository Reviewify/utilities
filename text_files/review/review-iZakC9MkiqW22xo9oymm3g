(their carrot cake is out of this world.) the atmosphere is really laid-back, and it's the perfect place to go with friends or family when you just want to catch up over some comfort food and beer. sure, it isn't for everyone--i can see how some people would find the ambiance kind of dated. but i think of it as classic. and, c'mon, who doesn't love dining amid some ficus plants every once and a while? i make it a point to visit gullifty's every time i'm in pittsburgh.
