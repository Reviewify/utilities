(seriously troy? but that's a different subject.) i stumbled upon this place, although the hour signs stated they would be closed, they were not! i happily danced my tired feet right in! thank you food gods for shining your delicious light upon me. the decor is cute, the service is friendly and the food is great! where can you go wrong? i've been back more than a few times. i heart me some falafel and hummus. i have a couple complaints but nothing major. okay, a few. -it takes a long time to get your food so call ahead or just don't go in starving like i usually do. (i understand quality takes times but i'm sooo impatient. waaaah!) -it's pretty pricey but once in awhile i think it's worth it. -the first couple times i was here, they served my food with doritos. uh? the last time it came with awful veggie stick chip things. yuck. if you're going to go the easy route, at least hit me with some stacy's pita chips. if you're into this sort of food, it's definitely worth a try.", "business_id": "C1OLx5RjPgBM4j9q7sg12Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-27", "type": "review"}
