(thankfully we're not at louis lunch) ketchup could go either way for me, if i need it so be it, but its not a make or break situation, in this case i do need something, and i'm okay with that. my last few bites are all bread unfortunately, a big pet peeve of mine, and the meat was good, nice flavor, but not the best i've had. i will compliment them in that they are the first place to actually cook my burger properly. ( in this case a nice and red medium-rare) the waitress also offers a follow-up inquiry upon first bite to make sure it is cooked to my liking, so a huge compliment for that. maybe its not the best burger we've had yet, but its up there, and there is something about this place you can't help but love. maybe its the history, the fact that its still a family run establishment and all the sites, smells and sounds of a great burger place are all prevalent. worth all the press and accolades? i'd say so, but still not burger perfection.", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-24", "type": "review"}
