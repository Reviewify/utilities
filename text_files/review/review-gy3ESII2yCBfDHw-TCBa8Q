(and as spotty as the service can be here, my worst experience at tommy doyle's surpasses by leaps and bounds my best experience at friendly toast.) in short, i wouldn't drive across town to come here, but if you're in the area and want a good sandwich, or a nice brunch that doesn't require a 60 min wait, then tommy doyle's is a good option.", "business_id": "SfWZsocz-eqeYO1YOvkPiw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-03-25", "type": "review"}
