(i bought a bottle from a local store for about $12 and paid $7/glass at abc). on a busy saturday night, our waiter still made plenty of time to make us feel welcome and tend to our interesting requests. it was packed full and the lively crowd made conversation a bit difficult, yet for a group just meeting each other, it kept things light and easy. can't wait to go back and try food and do a beer sampling.", "business_id": "HMQ_PUJR6y01NOoS2_vJdA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-17", "type": "review"}
