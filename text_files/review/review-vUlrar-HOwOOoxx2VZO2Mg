(on my way, i saw 3 clear parking spaces in front of my building.) at the restaurant, i spoke with j.j. who gave me the same lame excuses as the driver. infuriating. save your time and hassle, and try some of mr. noodle's competitors in westwood- emporium thai (http://www.ethaicuisine.com/contact.htm) or thai fresh (www.grubhub.com/thai-fresh). mr. noodle has gone downhill, and will not receive any more of my business until they acknowledge this.", "business_id": "1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}
