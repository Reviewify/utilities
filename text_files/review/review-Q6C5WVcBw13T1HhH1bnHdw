(his beers both fared much better, so i'm assuming there was something just wrong with the hefs that night.) we eat and notice that the chips are definitely not sweet potato, but are just regular chips and we as him about it. his response was, \"what are you gonna do?\" we finally pay (and luckily he got our tickets correct) and leave as fast as possible. we spent over 3 hours there and most of it was due to the incompetence of the waiter. my husband was surprised we were still there (and was hoping we'd be done so he could get better food) and after he got there, he understood why. from what i could tell, the other waiters were all pretty slow too, but not to this extent. another group that came in the same time we did got there food and that table rotated 3 other parties before we left. that is not right. i definitely would think twice before coming here. black walnut downstairs is much better, as is kubos across the way. i've heard amazing things about the indian place, but can't vouch for it myself. really, really disappointing.", "business_id": "1jf4fZV8IdsRy9yjhAix9w", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-09-07", "type": "review"}
