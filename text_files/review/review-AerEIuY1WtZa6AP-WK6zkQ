(i was surprised at the amount. i'm coming from a city where any night can be a potential sausage fest.) i'd go back, you can haggle with the bouncer on cover. single guys with even a single ounce of suave can meet a nice lady, vice versa. if the dj can get his head on right and play music that everyone can enjoy instead of just playing for one group, this could be a great place to party. i had a great time that night.", "business_id": "pLuntPgXBgUcA9mp7WA4kQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-10-25", "type": "review"}
