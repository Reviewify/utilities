(check out the photo i uploaded of the form w/ prices!) then you hand it over to the cashier who adds up all the various prices for the add-ons. it took about 5 mins to get my food, which wasn't bad at all. i ordered a chicken breast burger, w/ american cheese, all the free veggies, and a side order of curly fries. i have to admit, the burger was solid! i thoroughly enjoyed it. the chicken was perfect- a bit crispy on the outside, but moist and tender in the inside. the portion size was a winner as well. as for the curly fries, they were amazing! seasoned well, hot, crispy, and... curly? they really do give you a lot too! other pros: free wi-fi, good service, and a big lcd tv (i was able to watch for updates on the tsunami/earthquake situation in japan) all in all, i will definitely be coming back here the next time i have a strange, out-of-nowhere craving for burgers. but why not 5-stars? - it adds up to be a bit pricey for a poor college kid as myself. (my total was $8.25) - doesn't beat red mill (my fav!) (phew, that was a long review. but it was my very first yelp review, so thanks for reading!)", "business_id": "NuvWsd7os1l6Pp4Map1xPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-11", "type": "review"}
