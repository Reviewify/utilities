(you actually pay more than the coupon takes off!) i went to explain how the screens were split up so it was impossible not to order wings, and he said i was wrong. will never order from here since they were dishonest and rude.", "business_id": "8uz_6_ogNrpb_MxQnhjZGQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-08", "type": "review"}
