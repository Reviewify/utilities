(i might suggest you go pick up some espresso at tootsie's at the stanford barn first as i've newly discovered it thanks to bradley n.) the pretension is thicker than other large malls in the bay area, but you also don't have much of the riff-raff to deal with. it's a bit of a trade off i'm sure. frankly, i try to avoid malls whenever i can, as they feel sterile and only serve to make you feel guilty that you're not an active enough consumer in this capitalistic society. it takes away from all the amazing experiences you could be having in the great big world. but hey, if you've got an itch to buy something i'm certain you'll find it here.", "business_id": "2oFme3IiUSSi0PdAJNBxwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}
