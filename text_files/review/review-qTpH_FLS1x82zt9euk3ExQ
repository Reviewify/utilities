(groupon) the downtown dog is my favorite, the bacon is smoked so it is nice and crispy that surrounds the juicy hot dog. the ingredients inside was ketchup, mustard, mayo, sauteed bell peppers and caramelized onions. the old town dog has smoked bacon, caramelized onions, sauteed jalapenos, chipotle mayo and cotija cheese. this wasn't that great...kind of soggy...however, i do like the fact that there is a little cart with various sauces like tapatio, salsa verde, bbq and toppings like fresh onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos. service here was great. the staff was very friendly and sweet. they asked if we enjoyed our meal, which was very great since it doesn't have waiter service. of course we tipped them well too! =) overall, i would recommend coming here. however, be careful, the hawaiian bread may be overwhelming because of the sweetness of the bread. also, i would suggest getting all the toppings on the side instead of them putting it on the top of the hot dog...made the hawaiian bread very soggy. note: every dog haus is different as in the style of the exterior and interior designs. =)", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-20", "type": "review"}
