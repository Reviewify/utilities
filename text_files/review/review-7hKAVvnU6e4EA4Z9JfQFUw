(if you're really a sucker for the pork, you can add bacon to it, as a friend of mine always does. he swears it's transcendent.) personally, i really dig the fresh guacamole and the tasty (also fresh!) salsas, and i like my tacos a little lighter. i tend for the green monstah with chicken, or the ground beef with napalm sauce. (which is awesome. put it on everything. sparingly.)", "business_id": "L3uemg97EJZ1SfjEE60Qvw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-15", "type": "review"}
