(yes, see those adorable pups in my pic- you will see them getting their daily stroll past the libation garden. people remember them more than me, but i am not sad. the pups are super cool and they know it.) like much of what i have found in midtown, this place caters to the palate of tourists- \"they will eat anything\" is not a good approach to cooking. i go for a beer and to watch \"businessmen\" chugging 8% abv beers with a jager-back well before quitting time- i really hope they are using the marta. even though they have \"beer geek tuesday\" this is really a place for beer snobs in my opinion. i will give it a few stars because i do enjoy its location and the patio will be a nice place to grab a beer when the weather cools. when i am there, i stick with the cheese dip- it is cheese dip and my expectations are low. otherwise, the pizzas, salad, sandwiches, and other small plates have not impressed me. they list sublime donuts as a local pal...now that is a place that does what they do well. step up pint & plate and be the neighborhood gastropub you have underneath that plastic food you are serving now.", "business_id": "1i63faxXI1TQ7pNlLp3IPQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-09-25", "type": "review"}
