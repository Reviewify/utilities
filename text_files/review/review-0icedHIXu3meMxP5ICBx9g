( i do really like this place, i just with it would get its shit together) ---------------------------------------------------- very hipster-ish its cool though. i'd call the menu \"inspired\"... often for the better. sometimes for the worse. they have a great drink selection. the ambiance is very retro. breakfast orientated, but has meals for all day. the \"waiting area\" outside (where you can drink drinks) would be great if you didn;t have to wait so long...", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-19", "type": "review"}
