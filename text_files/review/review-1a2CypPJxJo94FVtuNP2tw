(the real secret is probably just a bit of mayonnaise on top of real, good quality shellfish.) during happy hour (all day saturday and sunday at the bar! w00t!!), the calif rolls are only $4, so it's definitely worth a try then! another appetizer/happy hour standout is the curry dusted calamari (with lime vinaigrette and chukka salad). it comes in a big round cocktail glass, layered with seaweed salad, cucumbers, cellophane noodles. it's almost a meal on its own! my companion and i got this as part of the japengo sampler plate, which also had shrimp dumplings (with coriander-mint pesto and ponzu) and spring rolls. apart from happy hour and the bar (which has tables and an outdoor patio, so you don't feel like you're at a bar per se), full dinner entrees at cafe japengo in the dining room are great (with first-rate service) but the food is not as memorable as japengo's sushi and happy hour.", "business_id": "baeBGUjh035MU3UkHvp8Vg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-03", "type": "review"}
