(i guess the rdu / ch college kids are super serious about their studies?) expressions knows how to dominate the college scene, with locations in boone, greenville (ecu), wilmington, greensboro, and salisbury (catawba, livingstone) and they often offer their (mostly) young patrons beautiful locally blown glass, along with some adult novelties. they also sell k2 incense, and apparently they used to sell salvia divinorum, so get your k2 before the nc general assembly buzzkills ban it like they did salvia. expressions also features live music---hip hop, freestyle dj, rock, indie, etc.---in their hookah lounge, which was just opened in 2010. you can catch some amazing local live acts here, like kangaroo (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6rrazqneiu) and zayd malik (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrav8vmyaa) and expressions runs food drives, too, each year for charity. apparently in 2010 they collected 7,214 pounds of food, or 6,075 meals. a dogooder head shop, now that's something i can get behind! expressions is located around back at the franklin street market, on the rosemary st. side.", "business_id": "Vtst8E8txms-PGMv6AETnw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-22", "type": "review"}
