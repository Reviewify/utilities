(wait can i use that word (sick) when it comes to food? sorry i'm clueless sometimes...wait...take that back...i'm clueless most of the time!! ;d). ok so this part deserves it's own separate paragraph isolated with spaces before and after. my most recent visit (5 visit so far which is a lot since i'm avoid east bay and a big sf snob) i had the most delectable mud pie with coffee ice cream, perfect crunchy crust, topped with chocolate liquid lines. oh (wo)man!! i could have died after eating that dessert. it was murderously delicious! i also tried the sliders. while i loved their homemade veggie patties, it seemed a bit dry mostly the bread. the sliders weren't as flavorful as i would have liked it to be. and lastly since i don't consider this a criteria for restaurants in general is the service. the service could be a little hit or miss. what happened to smiling staff members in restaurant establishments??!! could i have at least one smile, gurl/boy frens!! it's not that their service is bad; it's just not as good as their battered fried fries. shooooo! overall, i am always happy to visit this restaurant whenever i am in berkeley, which parking could be a bit difficult. happy stomach = happy me!!", "business_id": "S4a-MaxMszQjSPSs1JSM2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-19", "type": "review"}
