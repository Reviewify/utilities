(though i didn't pick up much of that vibe.) i can't complain about the beer selection. there were a number of interesting options on tap, though loyalists of the blind pig might not be impressed. a wine menu was also provided, with about 6-8 bottles available. the drink that stands out best in my mind was their cider on tap, which was crisp, refreshing and would be a perfect complement for warm, sunny weather. our bartender was warm, charming, and made sure we were cared for during our visit. we had taken a booth seat, and fetching more drinks would involve crawling over each other to get out of a tight space. luckily, business was a bit slow, so the bartender came over to check on us, clean empty glasses, and refill drinks with regularity. very professional and helpful. until people become familiar with the layout of the bar, there may also be some trouble in finding it. quality is listed as a location on neil street, but the actual entrance is on chester street. in fact, one of the main windows of the bar faces neil, and i could see curious pedestrians passing by, looking through the window and all over the building for some indication of what was going on. an outdoor sidewalk sign or \"entrance over there\" sign might really help to steer traffic in the right direction.", "business_id": "CSn2-XpArLLYeZ_k2BKzrg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-07", "type": "review"}
