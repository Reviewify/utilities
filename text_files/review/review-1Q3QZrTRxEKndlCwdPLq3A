(especially since we ordered the half and half - half onion rings and half fries as another side). unfortunately the spinach was soaked in oil. the onion rings were good, but the fries were soggy. the steaks were just ok. they are wet aged, not dry aged. of course the waiter tried talking up wet aged steaks over dry aged, but i know better. there are many restaurants in providence that are far better, so i won't be returning.", "business_id": "ezfOX2z0EOFH6UOQyrkRpA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}
