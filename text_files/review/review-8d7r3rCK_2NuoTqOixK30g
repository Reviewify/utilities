(not all flavors are offered each day.) an employee takes your order, and then when it's ready, you sidle up to the register to fork over your money. i've tried the following flavors on a couple different occasions; here are my thoughts: red velvet - yum! lush and delicious. black and white - a chocolate cupcake with white frosting and chocolate sprinkles. meh. ginger lemon - a ginger cupcake with lemon frosting. the flavors go together really well, without one flavor overpowering the other. however, the ginger flavor tasted watered down, like gingerbread with half of the ginger left out. this cupcake has so much potential, but falls flat. overall, the cupcakes are okay, but the frosting has too much sugar, and there's too much of it on each cupcake. that would have been cool when i was 10, but not so much now. oh, and the fact that a single cupcake is $3.25, i would have expected better - like an orgasm in my mouth - but instead i feel cheated. the next time i want a cupcake, i'll bake it myself, (or get it on someone else's dollar.)", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-11", "type": "review"}
