(hmm, they also have sobe in the fountain, but just the diet cranberry grapefruit one.) but go to their website. check out the dude. look how high he is. your expectations should be met with this place, or else you are bad at setting expectations. the chairs closest to the large tv are perpendicular to it, rather than facing it. this seems stupid. i'll be back, because i have a garbage can for a stomach.", "business_id": "qB_Vt4AUbDX6r6qhS6gJ8g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-08", "type": "review"}
