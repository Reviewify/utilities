(rf o'sullivans is just a few minutes away and has much, much better burgers, and it's quite clear how much it's going to cost. o'sullivans is the place for true burgerhounds.) but bartley's has a couple of saving graces. first of all, the menu is fun. half the fun of coming to bartley's is reading the menu. (of course, you could do this outside, for free.) the menu author has a great knack for making fun of famous people. second, it fits the vibe of harvard square oh-so-well. if you're new to harvard square or visiting from out-of-town, you'll get a great sense of the oddity that is harvard square. update: you know, the whole \"no bathroom\" thing is really bugging me. dropping you down to 1 star on that basis alone. how can you serve food and drink and not offer a place to go to the bathroom?", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-06-04", "type": "review"}
