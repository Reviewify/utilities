(not too far or your beeper will be out of range). i also find they usually seat you before the estimate provided. on the negative side, parking is tough (but that's why god invented the t!). is this gourmet food? no. is it a fun, affordable place to enjoy tasty food and strong drinks with your pals? absolutely. do it.", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-09", "type": "review"}
