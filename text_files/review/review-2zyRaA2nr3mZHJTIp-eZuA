(thankfully i soon figured out that the business could bill me instead of having me pay up front.) the only reason i've ever gone to this branch is because it's in a convenient location and frequently within walking distance. but- gah- i don't like it!", "business_id": "XN3_SMaF_AY1wf8KvCYGig", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-01-25", "type": "review"}
