(summer vegetable roll avocado, oshinko & marinated eggplant, topped with wasabi oil, grape tomato, balsamic vinegar & truffle salt.) the ceviche roll was kind of bland and a little disappointing but it was still good. rolls were also reasonably priced at about $10-13 for 6-8 pieces. will definitely be going back and i will definitely be ordering the summer vegetable roll again. so, so good!!!", "business_id": "SSmHkP0tZ4TKn_YUOEkVUg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-06", "type": "review"}
