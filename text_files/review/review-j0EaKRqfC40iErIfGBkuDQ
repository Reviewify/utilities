(i barely had a chance to try anything at the reception because i was so busy talking to people! make sure someone makes you a plate so you get to eat your food!) i wish we'd been able to take home the leftovers but i knew in advance that we wouldn't be able to (it's in the contract) so i am glad that at least the leftovers were donated. overall, we have no regrets about using bcc for our wedding. we had a beautiful wedding at a price we could afford. everything went incredibly smoothly and we and our guests had a wonderful time. the staff all worked to make everything go perfectly.", "business_id": "Xr2S-dlyHVYkoSHJEIm9fA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-16", "type": "review"}
