(and that's not necessarily a bad thing!) great atmosphere. great lighting. descent music. the bar staff is always polite and always seem to be having a good time. this totally became my favorite bar in austin... glad i stumbled into it!", "business_id": "TRMSNc6MM_YRzT1YnaEmWA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-05", "type": "review"}
