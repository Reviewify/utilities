(note: burger also available during weekend brunch) the space nice and airy. high ceilings. while it's more modern than ideal for brunch (i prefer cozy), it makes for a better overall dining space. rating based on the pancakes and brioche french toast, i'd say 4 1/2 stars for brunch. based on the burger and fries, i'd say 3 stars for lunch/dinner.", "business_id": "8lLs3dsSN-Am2_EtNfbXqA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-12-27", "type": "review"}
