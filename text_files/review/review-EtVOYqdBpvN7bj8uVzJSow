(current crush: secret pizza) my favorite thing about this place...the soda machine. i've never seen another creation as blessed with such high fructose corn syrup as their soda machine. so many possibilities from a single machine! zomg! grape sprite?! gtfo! you just have to try it. parking can be a beezy if you're trying to find street parking, there's a structure...but when i parked there in the middle of the day i ended up having to pay $12 for not even close to 2 hours. never seen the place busy, seats were plentiful and the wait was nonexistent both times i've been here. just thinking about eating pizza makes me want to go do some squats. -__-", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-28", "type": "review"}
