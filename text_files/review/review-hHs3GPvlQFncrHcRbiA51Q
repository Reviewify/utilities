(she claims they do). there was also an area of the store that had clothing and bags. i didn't really browse around this area as my friend was checking out... but it looked like they might have some cute items. i'd just say buyer beware here... know what you're getting and the quality you're getting before you decide to buy.", "business_id": "TpHXN_hwEi1fyv0rOvaf1Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-21", "type": "review"}
