(it would have been responsible on our part to check the card before heading out of halo, but when you are drunk as a skunk, you just want to go home and lay down). the only good thing is: halo closes around 3 am. we were able to get there on time and confronted the manager about the mistake. again, the manager handled the situation poorly and he pretended that it wasn't a big deal and he wasn't compromising on anything. hello credit card fraud!!!!! the night ended with a $40 cab ride home and 2 free shots. wasn't impressed at all with their customer service....", "business_id": "IVrNWF-tF5n-KjbhWhXYtw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-10", "type": "review"}
