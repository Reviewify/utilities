(one note: i encountered slow service during one meal within the first couple weeks of their opening, but i think this is forgivable given the growing pains of a new restaurant -- and though things were slow that night, the servers were polite and apologetic. on all other occasions, service has been prompt and courteous, so i'm willing to chalk that occasion up to a fluke.)", "business_id": "H_XBx4erPI4IrUo8WySPLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}
