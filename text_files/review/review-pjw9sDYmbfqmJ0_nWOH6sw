(he even took away a side dish with some food on it and gave us a fresh new one. he didn't have to do that, i really don't like wasting food!) i really liked cucumber kimchi which is provided as one of the default side dish. food was cooked with care, with appropriate seasoning. we tried fried dumplings with teriyaki sauce and bulgogi with octopus. both are highly recommended. the bulgogi and octopus was excellent in the way they were cooked and served; my only wish was that octupus would've been cooked just a little bit less since it was little bit chewy on certain areas. out of all korean food places around the town so far, i can say that my favorite was from this place. price is about what you would expect from korean restaurants around the town. i was satisfied with the quantity of food we (1 guy 1 girl) got with one main dish and one appetizer. no one really knows about this place and this place is always almost empty, which worries me. i would hate to see this place close down... i still need to try other menus.", "business_id": "nWu8OljDYmLfbLQqcfW9Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-27", "type": "review"}
