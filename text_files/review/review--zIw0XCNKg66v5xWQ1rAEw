(kinda slow service though.) there is a bar, but its not very good for watching sports - theres only one t.v. there homemade beer is pretty good and their cider is lovely for girls who aren't into beer. i gave it 3 stars though because its pretty average all around. its not a place that i get excited about.", "business_id": "-4ppieQivAHq4flJXwqy0g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-23", "type": "review"}
