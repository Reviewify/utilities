(though i've heard their meat isn't of the same quality [i'm vegetarian so i can't say for sure]). the staff are generally helpful and nice, with a few exceptions - all in all they run a very tight ship with prompt service and great food. the only thing preventing them from getting 5 stars is their high pricing.", "business_id": "jZGqAdBlDnrP-J7--vdPxA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-29", "type": "review"}
