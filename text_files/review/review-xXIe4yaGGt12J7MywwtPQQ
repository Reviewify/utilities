(and i've been shopping there for a couple of years.) they want you to bring your own bag and that's ok with me. but without any outreach to customers in the store, why not have the option of diy checkout and offer a discount to customers who choose to do that?", "business_id": "GfU3xrGC86YVl2NSxjcibg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-05", "type": "review"}
