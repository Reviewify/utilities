(although i think she's used to it by now, because everyone always messes up her steak orders.) the restaurant was very accommodating though. i called maybe 30-45 minutes before we were going to see if we could make a reservation. they said that they'd figure it out and told us to just show up. thanks for not making us wait! we didn't get a bread basket though, which of course, is really disappointing for me since i love bread... we only got two options- a sourdough and a sourdough with rosemary baked in.", "business_id": "JyOh6zIV1sGINuEnzOBckw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-04", "type": "review"}
