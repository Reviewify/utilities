(1800/month for a 2 bed), and rising. maybe it's worth it. maybe it's not. however, the fact of the matter is, management is indeed assinine. my roomate who lived there for 3 years, has mad major problems with them and i have not heard a different story from anyone else. they are greedy, corporate, little vampires. it look about 2 months to get them to agree to have new carpet installed (which was rightfully ours). they never fix anything. they tried their hardest to convince me not to get the new tile installed when it was time for free upgrades. ....and to top it off, there were multiple security guards patrolling the area. guards that are always conveniently there to kick you out of the gym, pool, complain about noise, etc. but guards that are not there when my car windows (along with neighboring car windows) are smashed with the alarms going off, and the radios stolen. how convenient. and when my father even brought it to their attention, managment refuesed to take responsibility for it. im sensing a theme here. i think i can be a manager. wear business clothes and tell people that it things are not my \"fault\" nor \"responsibility.\"", "business_id": "HzM_6WfMWtW3hBYpu757Fg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-29", "type": "review"}
