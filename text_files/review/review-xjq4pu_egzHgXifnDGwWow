'great cheese selection...surprisingly limited pasta brands selection, coffee good, not outstanding, delicious looking pasties - why do i have to be on a diet? breads look good, but again you will pay! they do not make the bagels in house sad to say. it is a fun way to spend an hour if you are a foodie, but bring your megabucks. parking may get to be a major problem with a walgreens.", "business_id": "n5s4xjB2jwwDHKE2Rj6tXw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}
