(since it's only a couple of people working, the cash sometimes stays on the table for a while, because they workers are busy handling multiple things.) as we stood outside the door, two teenage girls walked in, took the tip and ran out. i was really disappointed because small mom-and-pop places don't deserve that kind of treatment. unfortunately, we couldn't replace the tip because we had no more cash on us. on our next outing at koryo, we double tipped them. lesson learned... make sure to hand them the tip tray so that they get their fair share.", "business_id": "we3YxbueOBb0f-m7ekYk2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-11-28", "type": "review"}
