(i am a whitey brunette and i use the darkest level - level 3) i have a membership there which allows me to get about 7 tans for $50...(for airbrush/spray tanning that is really good) i used to only do airbrushing where someone sprayed in on themselves for you; that runs a hefty $30 a pop. i was there today and wish i knew the girls name who helped me, she is still a sales woman but does it in a very \"non-threatening\" way so i don't have to feel bad for saying no! if you ever don't have money on you; they \"charge\" your account which is nice too! ps: the free bottled water is underrated; you barely can use a restroom for free nowadays! i love it!", "business_id": "HD7UAHS4DhNlUkSmx0ubxw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}
