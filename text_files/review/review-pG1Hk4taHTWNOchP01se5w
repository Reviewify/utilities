an actual provision). i got a response saying the lease terms were written \"under texas law\" and any changes could constitute \"practicing law without a license\". i'm not a lawyer, but i do know that any agreement between two parties is negotiable - and the fine print on page 13 of the contract said the same thing. so, i submitted some reasonable changes (and a couple of ambitious ones, because by this point i'd grown exasperated by the month-long process) and awaited a response hoping there'd be enough middle-ground to still execute a lease. but after a couple more days without any response, i finally threw in the towel and emailed my withdrawal. i missed out on a cool home, her client missed out an already-approved tenant, and lifelock got a new customer because hh wouldn't return my personal documents when i retrieved my security deposit.", "business_id": "KjdpZIvLnR4gjWYcYnsWtw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-03-23", "type": "review"}
