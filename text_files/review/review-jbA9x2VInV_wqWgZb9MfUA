(the seafood is delicious enough that i can overlook the salad part.) i also have a soft spot for this restaurant because i accidentally left my favorite pair of sunglasses here before leaving for the summer. they patiently held on to them for months till i could pick them up. i'm a fan.", "business_id": "TWIrHUi2TWF5hWoVwakNAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-13", "type": "review"}
