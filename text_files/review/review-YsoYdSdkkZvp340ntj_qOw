(i forgot what it was called) was pretty good. service was ok. heading over to pay, there is sassy! i've not seen her and her business partner, sandy, since, like '95-ish. they used to run thai kitchen in skyway (once upon a time, it was more happenin' in the 'hood =p now it's just skyway park bowl...) and my family went there often. sassy & sandy make a great duo. i'll have to come back again sometime. i also like the space; clean, modern and nice.", "business_id": "OursSBHK7kwFEDD91i0o1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-07", "type": "review"}
