(my wife also liked the window-shopping in the rest of the building, and there's ice cream, coffee, good eats, bookstore, fashions, toys, furniture, etc. while you're waiting for whatever you may be waiting for, and all kinds of funky shopping and dining and music et cetera up and down the street from that, street buskers, strolling folk to ogle, whole lively downtown scene; not a generic mall experience like where the apple store is). not hating on the apple store, i did get a new time capsule there (lessons learned late in life are to be savored) ... and i give apple store all due props for being concerned and caring folk. but five stars for left click for saving my month. love you live, baby.", "business_id": "2NzXwHM9fQRwk9_1SF-9eQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-06", "type": "review"}
