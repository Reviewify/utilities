(it's just one room). they sell silly snacks, as well as aurora schwag. programming notes: expect home movie festivals, political documentaries, video dj performances, experimental pieces, great independent kids' shows, and other collected bits of image-driven bliss. other notes: goes well with onion creek or super happy fun land.", "business_id": "QBEyyxwTOk52FTorMShvEw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-08", "type": "review"}
