Finally, a month or so ago, one of my lovely girlfriends enlightened me... and I will never be the same. Burdick's is the perfect ending to a day of shopping and dining in Cambridge. Go for demitasse cups of smooth, dark, creamy hot chocolate capped with foam. Then stay awhile longer, lingering over one (or two) of their awesome dessert selections. Finally, leave with a set of their adorable chocolate mice.  A great place to thaw out in the colder months, Burdick's is worth the wait for a table.  PS I swear I always leave with stars in my eyes - Burdick's = THE BEST chocolatey sugar high....", "business_id": "gctbL0lDIYIHM6yDn99V-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-04-18", "type": "review"}
