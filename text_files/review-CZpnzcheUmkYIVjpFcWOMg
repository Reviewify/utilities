The options are as extensive as Pinkberrys but if you didn't know any better you'll be fine. The choices were original, key lime pie, and mango, and the mango was delicious. It wasn't too soft or anything else, absolutely perfect. The only issue that I would report would be the parking situation and that its kind of hidden. Since its in Downtown Amherst, they dont have many parking spaces available and you would have to know to look down this \"alley\" to locate.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JdG5e8zfYTu6_P29lQ-Wig"}
