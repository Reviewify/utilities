And thanks to my fellow Yelpers, we hit the jackpot! Nice place, great location and awesome outdoor seating by the creek. The drinks are decently priced and food is as well. I ate the stuffed quail and it was quite scrumptious. Great flavoring with simple spices not to overdo it. Perfectly cooked, every piece was juicy and delicious. Once we finished our late dinner we headed straight to the bars on the same block - told you it was a great location! I would def come back here - food was better than Ventana Grill anyway!", "business_id": "C44mTlN9hDsy9CGlgRQ8sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-19", "type": "review"}
