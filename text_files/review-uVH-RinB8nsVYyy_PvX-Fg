I honestly think this is the best place in ann arbor for Indian food. Medium spicy actually has a nice low burn, and everything looks carefully prepared and not sloppy. The buffet is one of the better ones in town, with many vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Even the buffet food is flavorful and decently spicy. And complimentary fresh dosa!\n\nAnother plus - very affordable. I think this is the cheapest weekday Indian lunch buffet in town. Items off the menu are not too pricey either.  Service has ranged from very helpful and friendly to a little flustered, but never rude. \n\nIt doesn't hurt that this place is right across the street from where I currently work... reminds me to go to this semi-hidden gem on state st. You should go too!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Cl9eNsG77yDH93hzmwD5gA"}
