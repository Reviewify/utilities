We ate here for a tiny snack after our Phipps flower trip, so I cannot fully rate the place because all we got was a Hummus wrap and a green been salad.  However, they were both delicious.  I loved my green beans.  There were onions and cranberries within the green bean salad which added a very delicious part to the plate. The atmosphere of this place is also fantastic.  It is very trendy and clean.  One can see the cleanness based off the fact there is 5 different kinds of cans for garbage.  Very cool and very trendy.  I wish more places were like this. I want to come back here and actually have a real lunch, so I can actually have a good opinion, but based on what I experienced, I would definitely come back.", "business_id": "EWswCV97BBb0ezXRZhCoOQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}
