I personally grew up in the independent insurance business (for 50 years my family owned a large independent insurance agency in NY) so i know what goes into running a successful agency. Until i met Donald Tripp, Owner of Dudley Borland i didn't think there was another agency that provided the personal hands on relationship i was looking for. The staff at Dudley Borland are the best in the business. They know insurance, they understand how to provide top shelf customer service and they are always looking for ways to improve coverage and save money. If you love your family and possessions you owe it to yourself to pick up the phone and call the folks at Dudley Borland.
