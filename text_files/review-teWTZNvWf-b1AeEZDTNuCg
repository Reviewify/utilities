I can deal with awkward servers, and bus boys that dive in to steal away my plate or vacuum around my feet, but seriously, there's a line that is crossed.\n\nA couple years back, I had come in for lunch.  Seated, menus, drinks.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  But then we wanted to order lunch.  The waitress said no! She said they wouldn't be serving food for another half hour!  Not only was I upset but the 5-6 other tables around me as well.  She said the owner told them to not take any orders but NOBODY told any of the customers prior.  I saw a few tables stand up and leave but we were hungry so we waited.  Then the food came and we ate and were promptly rushed out.  One server was very kind and apologetic and we asked if we could tip her...nope, she said she would get fired.  Whoever owns that place should be more respectful of their customers and their servers.  It really shows that the people who work there are not happy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg"}
