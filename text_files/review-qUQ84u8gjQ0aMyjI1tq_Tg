The place used to have the ridiculous name of \"Beaners\" but was recently changed (long over due).  The atmosphere kind of feels like a warmer Starbucks with carpet. The staff is super friendly so be prepared! And the coffee is not that great but service is good. The good thing is this place has free wi-fi access. And some pretty decent breakfast bagels. They usually have really good coupons, so keep your eye out. They also have a punch card to work your way to a free coffee!", "business_id": "ZZ8UPQBlkp4AmQZrIjpPww", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-14", "type": "review"}
