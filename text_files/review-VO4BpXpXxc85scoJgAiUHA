Maybe I'm just not cool enough or Berkeley enough to appreciate it. I went there for lunch, I thought the place was a little...prairie/church like, hard wood chairs and tables, a little sparse. The service was unimpressive, the recommendation for the more \"interesting\" of the 2 salads I was choosing between was still only lettuce, add chicken and an ice tea - $20. I am not a big person and I don't eat a ton but the portions were seriously small and the chicken looked rather unappetizing. Luckily I read another review that said to ask for the bread, otherwise I would have had to go get lunch somewhere else as well that day. Also, in addition to hardwood tables and chairs, trendy concrete floor. Of course this translates to no sound absorption - very loud. However, the flavor was good. Bottom line, oh so many better dining choices.", "business_id": "BiZAzf2SAFCE0gJrX-PGFw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}
