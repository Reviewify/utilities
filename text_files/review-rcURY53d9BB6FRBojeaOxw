We go way back; through what seemed like a zillion different managements; through ups and downs...and way, way downs.  I'm happy to say things have settled into something fairly consistent and fairly enjoyable.  It's a welcome addition to my very very small list of places easily accessible from work.\n\nFood is decent all-around.  Hot entrees, nigiri, maki are all enjoyable.  They have a pretty good list of lunch specials and reasonably-priced bento boxes that will totally fill you up.  Also, their lunch happy hour can get you some really cheap rolls/nigiri.  \n\nA couple notable \"misses\": their tenpura is not the best...it's often too thick/batter-y to the point where it still tastes like flour, and their maguro is always, always, always super fishy.  Also, parking is a pain in the ass despite (or maybe due to) the fact that double-parking is fair game in their lot.  It can get pretty busy, but if you go in for lunch a bit later, it's not so crazy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9VlV09HupfzZcRP3lTRi8Q"}
