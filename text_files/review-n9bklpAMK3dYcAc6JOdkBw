Pizza hut and Dominos are around the corner.... \n\nThe Chicken Ricotta pizza honestly didnt taste like anything. And the bread that came with it was cold and stale. \n\nMy second visit, I got the BBQ Pizza (which is not nearly as good as a Dominos or PAPA Johns BBQ but still ok...), But they bring my pizza to me ON TOP OF A CARDBOARD DISH, on top of a plate..... Seriously, wtf.... Not appealing at all. \n \nThis place needs to get itself together...\n\nThe Staff is friendly, but the Menu and paper table covers need to get upgraded, as well as the pizza.\n\nThey brought my pizza to me on CARDBOARD!!?!?!??!\n\n\nBTW! it tries to be classy, but it shoots itself in the foot as soon as you see the paper menus and paper table covers......", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbFqlHYbfbeLW7oKZDr-bw"}
