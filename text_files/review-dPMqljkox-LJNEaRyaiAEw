I enjoy an occasional visit to the bar, but I'm starting to notice that I'm becoming a regular at Silky's. It's hard not to find a reason to stop by the Silky's if you're downtown. The atmosphere is great; plenty of seating; unique art; clean bathrooms; fantastic drink selection; games; the staff wonderful; what more could you ask for:? All in all it just a comfortable and clean place to go and if Siskel and Roper started rating bars they would give Silky's two thumbs up. If you haven't been to Silky's yet, get down there; your guaranteed to have a good time.", "business_id": "NrN-0SRAb33cVyTXHj3kPg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-15", "type": "review"}
