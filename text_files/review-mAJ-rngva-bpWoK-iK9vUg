I'd suggest the regular glazed raised donut, old fashioned buttermilk, and the cinnamon stick. Oddly enough, there are even cheese rolls. I also tried a donut here, which I don't know what it was called, but it was in a bar shape. Actually it was more like the size of a brick and heavier than one too. The inside was packed dense with more donut and I don't think the inside got fried enough.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rNIKiUYsFlBdQ7xoOmYj4Q"}
