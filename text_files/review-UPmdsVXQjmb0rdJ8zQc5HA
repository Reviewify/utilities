I came here specifically to buy some Ploom stuff.  Whelan's is the only retailer that sells it in the East Bay.  I walked in and took a look around-- they had a decent collection of cigars and accessories.    The cigars I felt were a bit overpriced, but I wasn't there for that anyways.  I asked about the Ploom, and was told it was $39.99, and the packs of pods for it were $14.99.  I knew the $40 device price was right, but the pod price didn't seem right.  I bought it anyways.  When I walked out, I decided to do a quick price check online.  The Ploom website sells the pods for only $5.95!!  I went back in and asked if $15 was really the right price, and the guy that helped me asked someone else, and was told they were $7.99.  I was refunded $8 cash out of the register.  Still a bit higher price than the website, but whatever. If I happen to be in the area and want some Ploom pods, I might stop by.  Otherwise, I'll stick to ordering things online.", "business_id": "LQTZbHMktmK-F04MpsofWQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}
