I wanted to, but the more I tried for it, the more I felt a little disappointed.    The atmosphere is awesome and reminds me of my grandpa's old barn, but in a cool way.  And they had outdoor seating which I am always a big fan of.    Unfortunately the good experience ended there. I ordered the BBQ Beer Can Chicken, which sounded delicious based on the menu description.  I can't really nail down specifics on the meal,  only to say it was good, but not great.    I didn't order any alcohol, but they seemed to have an interesting blend of home brewed beers, including a 6 glass flight.  So I may go back to try some of that, but that might be about it.", "business_id": "NosYl_9KiDWOGT3YmNmwxA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-04-19", "type": "review"}
