My friend had a chicken breast which he said was good. I had the Red Curried Duck with jasmine rice and grilled veggies. This was an outstanding entree and I highly recommend it. The waiter on the other hand, was a little snooty and not too friendly. He appeared to be offended that I selected a bottle of mid-priced red wine from Napa Valley instead of his over-priced selections. The desserts were outstanding! I had the Peach Crisp with vanilla ice cream. My friend raved about the Pecan Chocolate Rum Cake. I would have given Madeline's 5 stars were it not for us having to go inside the restaurant (we were seated outside) to select our dessert. Anyone there ever hear of a dessert tray??", "business_id": "vI34pZUeUQWoX1aNTY7Rww", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-04", "type": "review"}
