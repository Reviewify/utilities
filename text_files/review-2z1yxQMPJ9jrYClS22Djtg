He appeared to be offended that I selected a bottle of mid-priced red wine from Napa Valley instead of his over-priced selections.\nThe desserts were outstanding!  I had the Peach Crisp with vanilla ice cream.  My friend raved about the Pecan Chocolate Rum Cake.\nI would have given Madeline's 5 stars were it not for us having to go inside the restaurant (we were seated outside) to select our dessert.  Anyone there ever hear of a dessert tray??", "type": "review", "business_id": "vI34pZUeUQWoX1aNTY7Rww"}
