The patio is just awesome. There's enough greenery and quiet to be able to not notice that you're in the middle of a major city. Well, unless you look up and notice the skyscrapers. The servers are all friendly, some spectacularly so. The bartenders can be chatty. Great if it's with you, not so so great if it's not and you need another drink. The food is better than average bar food, but not so great I'd go just for the food. The biggest con in my mind is the wine list, or lack thereof. The menu only lists Good, Better, or Best for reds and whites. But they're different varietals which aren't listed, not different qualities of wines. And it's served to you in what I can only call a jelly glass like your grandma served you orange juice in. I don't expect a great wine list at any place with \"Pint\" in its name, but this always grates on me when I go here. The penultimate con is that it can be hard to pay up and get the heck out of there if you're in a large group and you don't feel like paying for everyone. Some servers are aces with handling separate checks. Other times I've had to wait twenty minutes just to give them my money. This is partly my fault for consistently underestimating how long I'll stay and not carrying enough cash for an evening's worth of beverages. (This could be solved by getting an ATM on site.)", "business_id": "1i63faxXI1TQ7pNlLp3IPQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-05-17", "type": "review"}
