It's an over priced dump!  One of the garage doors spends more time broken than working and there are too many criminal incidents in the complex to count.  One resident was actually robbed at gunpoint in a common area... not exactly a secure place to live.  Some of the people living there are less than courteous and leave stinking garbage  in the hallways or piled up by the trash chutes. Keep in mind this is a building where you are forced to pay for valet trash service.  No matter what price they quote your for rent, you can add at least a couple of hundred dollars a month to your bills from parking, trash, water and other mandatory fees. The convenience of living next to a Metro Stop isn't worth your safety or piece of mind.  Do yourself a favor and skip looking or living at this high-priced hovel.", "business_id": "iH5a2hXZ0BonJS31n_TwNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}
