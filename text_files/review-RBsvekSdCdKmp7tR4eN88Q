Well, I don't know if she was a grandma, but if she was, and if I was Mexican, I would want her to be mine. That place closed, but it's heart beats on in Tortuga's Mexican Village. It's an adorable little BYOB ;) open for lunch and dinner, and they have different portion sizes for different times, so watch out with the expectations. Every time I go there I say I'm going to get something beSIDES the flautas, but then I go ahead and get them because they are SCRUMPTIOUS and delicious, and because I can't bring myself to leave there without having gotten that flavor of fried crisp to perfection tortilla and melty queso blanco. I only get the chicken and the cheese ones though because the beef and pork ones just don't taste right with the crispy flour tortilla outside. I guess you need drier consistency of meat. They give you chips and salsa for free, but guacamole is extra, although it's not one of those places with insane guac so I wouldn't bother. If you want sour cream on your entree you have to ask, but if they forget something they're always quick to bring it out, so just tell them! I've never had bad service there, and I've also never had to wait for a table, but maybe Saturday night or Friday night can get backed up and I wouldn't know, because I've also never gone on a busy sounding night of the week. Also they have this dessert with vanilla ice cream, cinnamon, honey, and some kind of friend waffle or other. I don't know if they still have it but they used to and it was amazing.", "business_id": "yTjuYyapvDgTRbMgiYtePA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-27", "type": "review"}
