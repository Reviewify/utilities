It is great for Fridays in lent as they offer delicious fish and chips.  Actually they give you far too many chips but the fish is super good.  If you go you should try other things from their menu.  I like to order the full Irish breakfast as a meal.  I also like the guiness beef stew as it reminds me of Ireland.  \n\nAs for the overall atmosphere of the place, it is great to watch soccer games at. the stools inside are kinda uncomfortable and while the weather is nice it's a Treat to enjoy your meal and company on the patio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wp5tEemRSdZZIp8Vk-IFBw"}
