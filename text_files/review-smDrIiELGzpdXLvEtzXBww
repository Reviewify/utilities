I've been waxed in various ways all over the world and I can honestly say that Zara is the best esthetician hair removal expert I have ever  met. She is very fast and I've not had any red bumps which are ingrown hairs from her expert technique. She tells me that the absence of ingrown hairs after her waxing  is due to her speed and her careful selection of the direction of her pulls. Highly recommended and Zara is a very kind and pleasant person to have perform this very intimate service. You will not be disappointed.....", "type": "review", "business_id": "CEYe2iZoOdsInxU9Mlbjcw"}
