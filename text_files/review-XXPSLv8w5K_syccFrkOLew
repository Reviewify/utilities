In the summer it's a great place to sit outside and watch the world of Blacksburg go by.  During the school year the restaurant and bar is frequented by graduate students, faculty, and families from the area.  The cellar has an upstairs restaurant, which has live music from local tallent many evenings.  The bar in the basement is our favorite place to get dinner and a few drinks. The menu differs by 4 ( i think) items.  The upstairs restaurant serving the 4 extra items which includes chicken parmesan.  \nFood & Drink: They have the best beer selection in town both on tap and in bottles or cans.  We often eat the Salmon Spinach Salad - it's huge and has a great selection of vegetables.  The pizza is also delicious and they have many gluten free options.  I also love the pasta - I often get it plain with a butter sauce and garlic.  They are very flexible to your food desires and the staff is very accommodating and nice.  \nOverall a great place to get some good food and have a great time with friends!\n\nSeparate from the restaurant and bar is the Cellar 6-pack store, which sells tons of specialty beers - a must visit!", "type": "review", "business_id": "76hIZMzHZ_lFM0p2N7_gRQ"}
