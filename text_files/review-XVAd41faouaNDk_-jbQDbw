The classes are perfect for me, not too stuffy or new age-y, if that makes sense, like a lot of yoga studios can be, just an awesome workout with awesome teachers, especially Mark Jansen, my favorite teacher ever! Their unlimited pricing is better than other studios too, I really hope that doesnt change! I tried a few corepower studios first but liked this studio wayyyy better, the vibe is just so much better and the classes and teachers better too. Hot yoga has been such a blessing for me in rehabing my neck and back from an auto accident, so I was really worried I wouldnt find a good studio when I relocated here from AZ, so I am very thankful I found this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "S5QYt4yuWq7hj8NzHTgT3A"}
