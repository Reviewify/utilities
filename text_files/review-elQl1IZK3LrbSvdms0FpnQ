I have gone to many different farmer's markets and this is the biggest and best by far. If you think the prices are high, make sure that you walk the whole market before you buy anything. Also, and this is a no-brainer, the best stuff goes first. You can always look online for what produce they expect to have each time, so if you are smarter than I usually am, you can bring your recipes with you. This is a great place to take your (well-mannered) dog for a nice walk.", "business_id": "dvMHcBgCdy72ikzEPTr7ag", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-13", "type": "review"}
