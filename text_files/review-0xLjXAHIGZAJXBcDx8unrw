The food was awesome considering it was 50% off when you buy a drink for a minimum of $3. You could eat a burger for a mere 3.25. We ended up ordering 3 full orders of wings (so yummy), a salad (not bad...), nachos (I wish there was more cheese), and some dip with imitation crab and other stuff (pretty damn good). \nI ordered a baileys and iced cappuccino for my drink and my friends ordered a couple rounds of sangria and Arnie's Army. The sangria wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. Arnie's Army however was surprisingly good. I don't typically drink hard alcohol and it was pretty much vodka. For all you ladies, it is a tasty drink well worth the money and alcohol percentage. \nOnly down side to this place? Bad service. We went up to the bar to order my drink because it wasn't on the menu and she told us just to sit down and ask our waiter. When our waiter came around to get our order she left half way through before we even got to finish telling her what we wanted. Our table was never cleared until we asked. \n\nWell worth it to come for happy hour, don't know otherwise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
