I've been coming for years, it's in the neighborhood. I recently went for my B'day. What I don't love is the service. It's just never been great. We waited for our drinks for 10-15 minutes. I seriously almost got up and got them myself because they were sitting on the bar for a while. 3 girls and two of us got our dinners while one had to wait another 3-5  minutes for her dish. I think I would come more often if the service was better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4_Z2QGkLj5QICAaSv94gnQ"}
