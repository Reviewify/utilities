I got the Waffle Dog ($5) which is a Jumbo Vegan Smart Dog dipped in vegan waffle batter and fried (on a stick) that comes with Maple Mustard. The mustard was really tasty but the Waffle Dog was really bland. They used a Jumbo Smart Dog and that's really the first mistake. Those things taste almost like nothing and battering and frying them didn't really do anything.  Next time I know to get a waffle and skip the dog.", "business_id": "Ey6t9YAXkaIp8Qi-nWEnDg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-12-15", "type": "review"}
