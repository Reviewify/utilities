The executive floor is very cool and the happy hour snacks are always nice to have.  They were renovating the gym for most of the time I was there but it was just good enough for what I needed. \n\nThe staff here was very friendly and by the end of it I pretty much knew everyone on a first name basis which is kinda nice.  I would especially recommend the sushi place in the hotel.  The chef there is amazing and is a great guy once you get to know him.  We would basically sit down and he would just make us whatever he wanted and it was all great.\n\nAlso, if you get a chance somehow the presidential suite in this place is absolutely ridiculous!", "type": "review", "business_id": "oVse63-Kc1elHM9pqaaacQ"}
