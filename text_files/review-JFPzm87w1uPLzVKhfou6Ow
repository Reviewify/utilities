Not impressed with service.  We had the world's most abrupt and \"don't bother me\" waiter.  I'm not used to having to order everything all at once (aps and food) - maybe that's Portuguese style.   It felt a bit overpriced for what we got.", "business_id": "Mva32iGvl0xICU76qwiwyw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-05-23", "type": "review"}
