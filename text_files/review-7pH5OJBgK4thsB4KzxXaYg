(being organic, gluten or dairy free, or vegan are just side benefits to some)\n\nEven though the menu changes every now and then (it's now \"normal\" food on one side and  vegetarian on the other...with some vegan dishes thrown in)  there are some excellent constants\n\nCalafia Burger - Juicy, ample, and very tasty.  The bacon is excellent and the bun is about as good as Mayfields (which is right next door).\n\nShaking Beef Salad - Very tasty.  The greens are delicious (fennel, arugula, mint - can't go wrong with those) and the marinated steak with sesame seeds sprinkled all over are a very nice combo!\n\nThe prices are good, the food is excellent, the decor is \"hip\" but not \"hipster\" (aka: douchy) .  The wait staff is attentive and Charlie Ayers himself has treated us with great care ensuring our Calaifia experience was good.\n\nAfter your meal you can just walk over the other side of the establishment where the cafe/market is and order some quality coffee & desserts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}
