Kinda left-field, but awfully good.  Who'd'a thunk the old Philly standby would go so well with copiously sprinkled jalapenos?  I'm here to tell you, buckaroos, that it does.  Another nifty plus is that the restaurant caters to the parsimonious college population of UT next door, so you can get refills on your obscenely huge carbonated beverage for only a quarter (or at least that's the price I paid when I was here...let's not say when that was and assume that, even adjusted for inflation, they're probably still pretty cheap) and brother, you'll want a big chilled beverage when those peppers hit your tongue.  Jack Klugman can even go to Austin and not miss Philly so much anymore...provided he brings his Maalox.", "business_id": "hy5mLCxslruz46Y16yd7Pg", "stars": 4, "date": "2005-06-16", "type": "review"}
