They had exhibits of Eric Carle's artwork, Dr. Seuss, and other great children's books. They also have a wonderful auditorium where they put on free shows (when we went it was an electric cellist). The gift shop is awesome as well since they have all these beautiful little things that you just have to get/add to your wishlist. And, if you do have children with you, the art room is so cool. They have people in there to help the kids get stuff/make stuff and there is a lot of space for their brains to create great pictures. Definite must see no matter how old you are.", "business_id": "VhpRKw2w_x3foU0x2k5EFw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-02-07", "type": "review"}
