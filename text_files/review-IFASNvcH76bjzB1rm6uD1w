The collard greens and fried corn were delicious as well. Can't go wrong here.  Important note: there is free parking behind the restaurant! You have to turn right on an unmarked entryway to the building next to the restaurant (pass the $3 parking lot) to be able to reach the free parking lot. Most people end up parking at the $10 parking lot because the free parking lot was so hard to find.", "business_id": "zNqQSYafieEgxB2nZ8yAFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-21", "type": "review"}
