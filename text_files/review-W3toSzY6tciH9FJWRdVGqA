They have a covered front patio and a back patio (sunny in the mornings) too.  Music occasionally, and they serve the amazingly good Lighthouse coffee, roasted at the Lighthouse shop in Fremont.\nSolstice bakes their own items, having just opened a new, larger bakery and cafe in Seward Park.  Ask for their baked goods at your favorite cafe around town.\nI'd recommend the cranberry shortbread cookies - esp if they are just out of the oven.  AMAZING.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AXQhTGR3PLFk1TW72CbqvA"}
