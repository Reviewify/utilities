If you like big open spaces with lots of people in it but still a place to sit and write on your lap top go to the U-Village one they are very good down there and they have special drinks that you can only get there. If you like small cozy spaces that have a fireplace and big chairs Or maybe you want to sit at a wooden table and work on your laptop go for the Starbucks near the big green house on 35th. The service there is great and the people that work there are nice. What ever you do do not go to the Starbucks in the barns and nobles it's may serve Starbucks but it is not a Starbucks although the Starbucks in the north gate QFC is just fine to go to if you need a pick me up after some shopping. The actual Starbucks in the food court at north gate mall is okay the drinks and food are as good as any the lines though are way to long so be warned but enjoy the goodness of Starbucks as often as possible", "business_id": "dWV41BVCxC30m6HTgRqQZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-12-23", "type": "review"}
