If you can get past the cost, you'll find a good variety of flavors that are well executed. I tried their strawberry cupcake, which I considered subtle in its sweetness (a good thing). Lots of frosting, but I wasn't overwhelmed. The cake itself was good, though it didn't stand on its own as well as other cakes I've had; it needed the frosting to really have genuine flavor. The complete cake/frosting package was a nice treat though, and unlike other cupcakes I've eaten, didn't leave me with a sickening feeling from a sweetness overload.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-29", "type": "review"}
