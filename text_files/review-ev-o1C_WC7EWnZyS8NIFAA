Not fun.\n\nTry their soups too! The Veggie Chili has a really different flavor from than any other chili I've had.. It tastes weird at first, but grows on you until you've annihilated the bowl. \n\nGets busy during lunch so expect to order to go. Plus side is the service is super fast. \n\nHave yet to try their hot drinks, but as for the pineapple juice/strawberry juice? I'm a fan. Definitely not the best fruit juice I've had, but it is fresh and you get some pulp so that on its own is pretty dericious. \n\nIf you feel like being \"healthy\" mattina is the place for you. (like you could possibly be healthy eating that huge of a salad, COME ON.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw"}
