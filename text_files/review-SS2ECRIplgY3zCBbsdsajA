Which was basically chicken and vegetables in a garlic sauce. The garlic they used was clearly that nasty, pre-chopped kind that is in some sort of marinade/preservative/pickling liquid. Basically the kind that comes in a jar, you have to keep in the fridge, the kind people that don't ever cook use when a recipe calls for garlic..... As you can imagine (or have experienced yourself) there is a huge flavor difference between this type of garlic and the fresh kind. And ohhhhh boy you could taste it in this dish. Very strange tasting, and absolutely covered in these little chunks of pre-chopped, marinated yucky garlic. I mean.... come on!!!! The dish is called \"garlic\", use some quality ingredients!!!! This was the type of meal that when you think back on it it actually makes you slightly nauseous. Blehhhh.\n\nMy boyfriend got the pad-thai and wasn't impressed with it at all. I tried a bite of it and it definitely didn't taste like any pad-thai I had ever had before (which can be good, I'm all for new things, but this was not a good \"new\"). I only had one bite, so I can't pinpoint exactly what was different about it, but it definitely wasn't something you would want to eat a whole plate of. \n\nMaybe we just tried the wrong things? I'm not sure, but I do know we won't be back again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OursSBHK7kwFEDD91i0o1w"}
