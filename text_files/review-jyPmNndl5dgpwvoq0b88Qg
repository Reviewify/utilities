This Bartell is big though, which is pretty much the only reason I shop here, although sparingly. Because it's so big, it pretty much has everything you would need if you don't have the time to stop by Safeway or QFC. I don't use the pharmacy here so I have no comment on that, but the staff here is nice. Lots of parking since it's in the U-Village and this location is open til 11PM, later than the one on the Ave.", "business_id": "PFSFEI3xrjSw17uetOUkhg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-01", "type": "review"}
