A little expensive but a fun experience. Try the wine flights, they are the best deal for drinks and a cool way to try a bunch of different tastes. Not a place to go if you are really hungry but a great place for a smaller meal and some wine. Perfect date place. Seating can be hard to come by, especially on the weekends.", "business_id": "BdpaiSFcwCJKQHV7nhez7g", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-27", "type": "review"}
