We were feeling like going on an adventure so we tried out the Pasadena location since it is so much closer to us.  When you get there they give you your menus which is a clipboard and you fill out the type of burger you want.  You get to pick your cheese, up to 4 toppings (premium toppings are $1/each), sauce and bread.  They also have a special burger which is the MP selection.  \n\nMy nephew got the mini burgers with fries and he loved it!  For the appetizer we went with the Parmesan fries, a definite must and it's good for sharing.  I ordered the 1/3 lb with softened brie, dried cranberries, roasted red peppers, pineapple, lettuce mix with ginger soy sauce all wrapped in a multigrain bun.  It was awesome!  All the flavors mixed well together especially with the ginger soy sauce.  My sister got her burger with jalapeno jack cheese, pineapple, roaster red peppers, lettuce mix and grilled onions with the same sauce.  She is not one to finish her food when we eat out but she finished his one, that has to tell you something.  My brother ended up getting the horseradish cheese, grilled onions, red peppers, pepperoncinis, roasted corn & black bean mix with basil pesto sauce.  All of our burgers were perfect!  \n\nService is on point.  Our server David took excellent care of us.  He answered all our questions and checked up on us frequently.  He also reminded us that they validate for the parking structure which is always a plus.  \n\nWhen you go here don't get the traditional stuff, experiment.  If you're not sure what to get ask for some suggestions.  Live outside the box.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MAW0cVbtqZEoXVESDkVDFQ"}
