They have awesome fried pickles, and their medium sauce is very hot... just the way I like it.  I've never been fond of their Dr. Pepper, Ranch, Tarrayaki or Barbecue flavors.  \n\nSometimes the service can be pretty bad, and the place is sort of a dump.  They have a few TVs to watch sports games on, but it usually isn't the place to go to watch games since there is always a wait due to their limited 15 table capacity.\n\nParking is usually hard to come by, especially during UT football games or when school is in session.  You usually are best off finding something on the street since most private lots tow vehicles.\n\nAll-in-all, this place is good once in awhile.  However there are better places out there in my opinion.  Although it is nice to have some greasy food every now and then...", "type": "review", "business_id": "hGNI2d-tCmVwUWKztDDl2w"}
