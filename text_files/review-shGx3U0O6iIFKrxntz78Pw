Honestly, I don't care for the tofu burgers, I just get the vegi stir fry. It's not great, but its good. And it's mostly good because the vegis taste fresh. Large seating areas so it makes it a good place to just chill in between shopping, sip a beer and eat a light meal.", "business_id": "ZRm8fSEBn8DsSLD4o7T4hQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-31", "type": "review"}
