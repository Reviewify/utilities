I ordered the vegetables with brown sauce and egg flower soup. The soup is OK but the vegetables with brown sauce is too salty. I am Chinese and grew up in China, and I don't really cook. I can even make a better dish at home than what I ordered. The good thing about this place are they offer you brown rice, the staff is friendly, and service is fast (good for a business lunch).", "business_id": "kni47-g5-ux_JhCaxnJYBg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-10", "type": "review"}
