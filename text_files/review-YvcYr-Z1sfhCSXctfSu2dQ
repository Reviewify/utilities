Lots of GDI's (goddamn independents), a decent dining hall (clean and comfy - booths - very restauranty) and close to Paradiso and That's Rentertainment. I spent many a night outside with fellow porch rats. Discussing, smoking, listening, smoking and smoking some more. The people I met within the first two weeks at Allen remained my core group of friends throughout college (and beyond). I can't believe I had this place down as my third choice. (the six pack was closer to the art building). I don't know where or how I would've ended up without Allen.", "business_id": "ImsH-N-I-I6yxATvNPSzUg", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-11-26", "type": "review"}
