I thought that strip was Comm. Ave the whole entire time... DUR. Now that I've got that out of the way.... Fin's is a solid sushi place...not the greatest though. Having lived in NY for over half a year, I have been spoiled by the world's greatest sushi. Am I comparing apples to apples? Absolutely. Boston is also known for superb seafood and I have lived there all my life. For a Saturday night duo date, we decided to do family style and ordered the sashimi platter and two rolls: Rainbow & Ocean maki. The rainbow maki was not good. It was kinda plain and it lacked flavor. The ocean maki containing soybean sheet with salmon sashimi wrapped with tuna avocado in a honey wasabi sauce...which was fantabulous. The sauce was simply amazing. The sashimi was a little over average... again emphasizing that some of the pieces just didn't seem fresh to me and the cut was not proper (pieces were too big). I did notice that they do salmon really well here, which is kind of odd. It was the buttery of the bunch! It's decently priced sushi, so the value is definitely there. Any more than what we paid for and I would have been outraged! I guess if you're looking for bargain sushi, this place would be it. So let's sum this review up already! \"Nothing special\"", "business_id": "YA2zC4F32g-BwRfQ0KUeaA", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-03", "type": "review"}
