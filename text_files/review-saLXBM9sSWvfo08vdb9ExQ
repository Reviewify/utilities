Slate tables, low lighting. . . depending on who you are the Garden State soundtrack playing in the background is either a plus or a minus. . . The food was pretty good - it's not so much \"pizza\" as it is flatbread with toppings.  You can't pick it up with your hands, and there's no meat lover's special.  The salad was tasty, had the right amount of dressing, and the produce was wonderfully fresh.  I felt that a salad and half a pizza was plenty of food for a light dinner for two. I wasn't as blown away as other reviewers, but it is a classy, relatively quiet spot in Harvard, which can be a real lifesaver when you're out on a Friday night.", "business_id": "M487o17d25K9Jnrf-bKFQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-13", "type": "review"}
