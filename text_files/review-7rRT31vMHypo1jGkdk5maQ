My daily Pasadena staple of too-many-carbs-to-burn-off during the day.   I'm all too familiar with Einstein's, having worked a few years in downtown Chicago.   The bagels are definitely a bit chewier in consistency than that of Noah's and less crisp on the outside.   But one big omission is their lack of having an egg bagel flavor.  I hope this changes one day.   My upbringing as an honorary Jew will not allow me to abandon this staple.  Get with the program Einstein's!!", "business_id": "TgWlYYP6G1Lm1Hyv8RRiKw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-02-01", "type": "review"}
