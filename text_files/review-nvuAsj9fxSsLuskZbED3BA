Its in the heart of Westwood Village but not the most authentic Indian place. I ordered vegetable samosas which did not smell good at all, the service was so slow. I didn't even order any entrees and left. A place that serves beef is not authentic Indian (or not even Indian...) I had a bad experience and will never go back.", "business_id": "Ee7h-Pp4jhAEQVK7ay2AtQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-05-13", "type": "review"}
