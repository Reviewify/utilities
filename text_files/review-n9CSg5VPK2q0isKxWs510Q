They are brewing ACTUAL COFFEE! I'm a *huge* Counter Culture fan and they sure know how to make a cup of it. The coffee is always so strong and delicious and the people who work there are so nice. It takes a couple visits for them to get to know you but then they are so friendly. The food is pretty good but perhaps a tad expensive for what it is. Hands down the best iced coffee in University City (I say this after extensive research on the subject). Be sure to get a frequent visitor card - the 10th cup is free!", "business_id": "eblnR1cQsR_aeUkNu38VkA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-13", "type": "review"}
