Since we were so hungry and we were by \"Gypsy's Trattoria Italiano\" we decided to try it. The place was so crowded and noisy we have to wait to get the a table.We asked for the calzone SICILIA for just $5.69 and the calzone COMBO for $6.29 which was yummy!. we also got the chichen piccata and it was also great it was really tasty and good seasoned. This is not a fancy place I think next time I'll call ahead for take out because it was a long waiting and for the service it's not bad but nothing exciting so my 3 stars are just for the food but definitely I'm coming back because the food it's tasty and cheap It's just a deal!!", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-25", "type": "review"}
