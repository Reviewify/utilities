I ordered the chicken souvlaki with the side salad. The chicken was juicy and tender, the cucumber sauce was light and tasty, and the pita bread was thick and soft. The greek side salad had the perfect amount of feta and the dressing was perfectly simple. People watching from the outdoor seating on Thayer Street makes the place even more fun.", "business_id": "sIsXmah-sGpHaKBjU3KOFA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-09", "type": "review"}
