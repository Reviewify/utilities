I came with my husband and a guest who have both been eating here at least 1x a week for the past 6 weeks.  \n\nMy husband reports that not many of the appetizers are that great, although he did order the ebi katsu (sesame crusted prawns) that night and really enjoyed them.  Our guest ordered calamari which he's had every time since going.  I must admit that I don't like calamari, but I thought that Boom's wasn't too bad and they had a great sauce for dipping.  I started with a cocktail - the eleven one five (?) - per a recommendation on here.  It was okay.  \n\nI ordered the kimchi ramen which I enjoyed although there was tons of soup left over.  It was hard get the taste of the soup in the noodles.  The sizes are hefty as everyone reports.  I was miserable despite the fact that I had so much left over and my husband ate a good portion of mine.\n\nFor my husband and our guest, they both ordered pad thai and LOVED it.  D has ordered it the past 4 times and won't deviate.  Our guest had his first experience with it and loved it.  He reports that the red curry noodles are also great.\n\nAtmosphere it trendy/modern/sleek.  It was extremely cold - the AC felt like it was set at 55 degree.  Even my husband who freezes me out at 65 or colder was chilled.  \n\nOtherwise no complaints.  I agree with other reviewers, this probably isn't a restaurant  where I would go out of my way to eat at, but obviously if you're in the area and like asian influenced cuisine, this isn't a bad stop.  And it definitely exceeded my expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2DEz094o_CZQo2m_rQSoqw"}
