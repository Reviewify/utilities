He told us this place was relatively new, and they had a full bar, so we decided we would give it a shot a couple nights ago.  We weren't too hungry, so we primarily ventured there to get a drink or two. We arrived around 8:15pm, the restaurant wasn't too crowded, seemed to be picking up. We grabbed two seats at the bar. We were immediately greeted by the friendly bartender (Dan) who by the way, made excellent drinks. Even better, my girlfriend, who is not the most decisive person especially when it comes to choosing a drink, was pleased with Dan's suggestions and creativity at the bar front. He made us feel like regulars.  After about 45 minutes, we built up an appetite.  Dan also suggested a few things off of the food menu, so my girlfriend and I decided to start off with the oysters, and we also split a forest floor pizza. I must say we were impressed. My girlfriend is picky when it comes to oysters, which we both enjoyed. And they weren't stingy on the mushrooms on the pizza that's for sure. Which I must admit, was a great thing. After a couple more drinks at the bar and another tasty food order for me, (Ham and Eggs) We were fans. We will definitely be back, not only for the food we tasted, but for the wonderful service and experience we received.", "business_id": "02A7EMn1GbOtsX3w8NwTAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-19", "type": "review"}
