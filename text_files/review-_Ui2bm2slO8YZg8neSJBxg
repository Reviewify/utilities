The prices were outlandish for what is offered, the service takes forever, and the food is mediocre at best. As a tip to the owners: Please don't serve anymore burgers -- they suck. On the other hand, your fries redeem your restaurant somewhat, and that's why I'm writing this review. I truly believe you may have a business in specialty fries, as they are quite good and you offer a large number of sauces. Do a number of tests with different flavors and combinations, and you may have yourself a viable business that isn't going to shut down after a year or two (as I imagine you will now). Reinvent yourselves, speed up your service, and keep your costs low. Good luck.", "business_id": "cFp-Kr831uIA3F6o5aeV2Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-20", "type": "review"}
