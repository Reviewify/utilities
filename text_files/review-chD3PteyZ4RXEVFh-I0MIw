The menu and beer are great and I love the out door eating space. The shrimp poor boy is easily the best I've ever had. Sadly the staff really dropped the ball on our last visit.  After bringing us a pitcher our waitress told us she was about to get off and our new waitress would be there shortly. 35 minutes later our beer was gone, our stomachs rumbling, and still no service. Our original waitress was still on the job and helping the tables around us. We flagged her down and asked to order and she actually rolled her eyes at us and sighed! She even tired to tell us we should just keep waiting. We started to leave and then she finally took our order. Our food got there pretty quickly and it was amazing but our new waitress only showed up as we were finishing, 75 minutes after sitting down. We never got any further drink service. This was a bad move because we  had been panning on partying that night so instead we went over and gave our copious amounts of beer money and tips to Jupiter. The worst part was that it was a Monday night and it wasn't even busy!  They seriously need some retraining.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VJW_lfjWxofdtpuVRPY0yQ"}
