I have never been as happy with either of these services as I am going to Shane in Westwood. The location is perfect for me as I can stop by before or after work and the owner is very easy going and always listens to exactly what I would like done. Almost more importantly, the pricing is very fair and especially for students as there is a discount offered for them. Having lived all over the U.S. and dealt with many, many, many hairstylists over the years -- this is my FIRST yelp review for a Salon and most likely my last as I will ALWAYS go to Shane as long as I live in Los Angeles. Everyone who works at Shane Salon is pleasant and inviting. I recently had my eyebrows shaped by Ashley and absolutely love what she's done.", "business_id": "3iSwk-H-PiiGistUOJXz7Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-12", "type": "review"}
