We had to pay a cover charge to enter. It was late & we were hungry. First after 10 minutes of waiting we were told there was only 1 piece of salmon & we had to choose which one of us would get it. The winner of the meal got a lg piece of salmon, & a very generous portion of asparagus. I, the loser ordered something else. After at least 10 minutes the waitress returned to advise they mysteriously found another piece of salmon, I was shocked, starving & famished after watching the other 4 people at my table consume most to all of their food. I finally received my plate & guess what??? The new found much smaller dry, over cooked salmon & the small portion of asparagus was over cooked, which lead me to believe it was someone elses leftovers re- heated. I wasn't happy in the least but after watching everyone else finish their meals I nibbled a little. I was an unhappy camper. Then to round the evening off it was time to divvy up the bill. Well we couldn't do it evenly because much to my chagrin we discovered that the pitcher of Margarita I was drinking on an empty stomach cost $30.00 + tax + gratuities. I was very surprised, shocked & pissed (on) off. My stomach was empty & I didn't even get a buzz. Yes, I could afford a $30 drink, but I would like to have been given the option of knowing so I could make a more informative decision (not to get the drink). It wasn't worth it. I nor any of my friends will ever go there again to be robbed. PS. I took my horrible meal home in a doggie bag & it stayed in my refridg until it molded, I just couldn't eat it & I wasn't leaving it for the next person who ordered the salmon & asparagus. After all, that's how I ended up getting the booby prize!!!!", "business_id": "C_EtrXTygRX5RTUOKtO6Dg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-14", "type": "review"}
