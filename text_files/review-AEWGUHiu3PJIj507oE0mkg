It's the perfect afternoon treat as you are strolling the streets of downtown Berkeley.  \n\nYou might expect it to be a small dessert, but it made me full!  A generous scoop of ice cream smashed with two giant delicious cookies should cover my lunch!  \n\nI love the idea of this shop, but I must admit the ice cream was not as tasty as I wanted it to be.  I chose Green Tea with Sugar Cookies.  The combination of the two was pretty good, but was not the best.  I think the ice cream ruined it for me.  It became nothing to really rave about, other then the concept of an ice cream sandwich shop.  The cookies deserved a grade of A- though.  \n\nOf course for the price, I can't expect much.  Worth a try and will probably come again for a different combination.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
