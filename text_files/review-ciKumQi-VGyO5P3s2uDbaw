Ike's is the flavor of the quarter on campus right now, but it won't stay that way unless certain things change. WAIT: This was my second time to eat here.  I waited in line for 15 minutes to order and then waited more than another 40 minutes to get my food.  It was only about 10 minutes faster the first time, so this is not an anomaly. ATTITUDE: I overheard the conversation of a guy who went up to the counter and asked for a refund b/c he had waited more than 40 minutes for his sandwich and it wasn't out yet.  Reasonable request.  The employee said, \"Try Subway. They're right down the street and they're faster.\" PRICE: $14 for a menage a trois, a bag of chips, and a can of Pepsi.  This is pricey. FOOD: I ordered a menage a trois (BBQ chicken), which was pretty good but certainly not exceptional.  Unfortunately, they were already out of dutch crunch at 12:15 PM, so I had to settle for french roll.   Bottom line: Go there for something new to get out of your boring campus eatery routine, but don't plan anything else the rest of the day unless you eat at an off-peak hour.  Make it a social event.  Also, order something with bacon.  After waiting for so long, you will deserve it.", "business_id": "GqFwgMpqggQgYTco0AbEAg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-17", "type": "review"}
