They sell good-quality food, which I appreciate. I know I can safely buy food here and it is not full of byproducts or grains. The staff are friendly and helpful. I love shopping small and local where I can, but ultimately my wallet has to have final say.  After doing a lot of price shopping, I found that they usually meet or beat  online and/or big box retailers. Oh, and you can special order and they will give you a case discount for canned food. (I thought that only happened with wine!) This is a great spot that I plan to use for many years.", "business_id": "t6bhgKxsZDnbny0KW8o-jA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-09", "type": "review"}
