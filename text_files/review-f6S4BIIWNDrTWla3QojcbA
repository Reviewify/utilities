One of my friends here in the \"A\" (male friend I must say...I will spare his name...but nexttime I will not! LMAO!) Invited me to this place on a Friday and let me just say....Heck to the Naw! In other terms \"GHETTO\"...Ghetto meaning: hood rich fabulous hood bling pimpin no character of style at all... I don't know why he even invited me to such a place...\"trust\" he got part of what I'm venting now...hahaha Let's just say...Ok so, I know I am not all that...but the Men in Leopard were looking at me like they knew I was cut from a different cloth and was on me like white on rice...! It was just toooo much...Leopard needs a face-lift of NEW people with class, style, grace and Hollywood glam! A face-life period for the club itself...(Have the owner contact me, I got him/she for a small intro fee..to give this place a much needed facelift!) Spend some of the money on upgrades... I just don't get what people see in this place....its not a classy club at all but got soo packed like rats...people actually like it here...The place looks as though it had not been updated in centuries..the downstairs rapped around this corner to only be hit by a wall with no d\u00e9cor. The downstairs was one way in and one way out....trapped! The men...ladies...the men was not \"it\" at all...come out the house next time with something on that don't look like you just got out of bed fellas... Gosh....is this what ATL has to offer....I can't wait to see more...maybe I need to hit the RITZ's and have a drink with some midtown folks.....any takers??
