Sushi chefs are sweet and attentive, as well as pretty entertaining. i always get extremely fast service at the bar and if you're a sushi buff, you should know that the fish should be eaten immediately after being prepared. Sushi will taste better at the bar and the sushi chefs will really take care of you. It's a good idea to let the chef pick a few things for you since he'll know what's fresh.\n\nService:\nThe hostesses are amazing, sweet and make you feel  at home immediately. They are right on the ball, and make sure you are always well taken care of. I could not ask for better service.\n\nThe fish:\nThe sashimi and nigiri sushi are my favorites. They always have great fresh fish that does not disappoint. I love the conch, albacore, tuna, uni,and crunchy spicy tuna (the rice is warm and crispy and pairs perfectly with the spicy tuna; i like it with avocado). The kobe beef and calamari salad are orgasmic.\n\nSushi is my favorite food, I'm part japanese, and I've eaten at just about every sushi restaurant on the westside. \n\nI've eaten at katsuya, koi, katana, sushi roku (santa monica, vegas and hollywood), tengu (westwood and santa monica), hide, tomadachi, kiriko,echigo, uzen sushi, hamasaku, sushi masu, sushi mon, Taiko, Yuzando, Mori, En Sushi, Hump, and Sasabune. So I definitely know my sushi, and  Isshin is definitely one of my top favorites.\n\nI love sunday nights because they have karaoke. So much fun!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SASKKO2nRWJ5UOH2ZiF91g"}
