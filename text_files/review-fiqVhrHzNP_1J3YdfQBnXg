But she did a mediocre job on my hair. I have a big head of hair so I take awhile, and her next appointment was about to start so she just stopped cutting my hair. Uh, HELLO! I understand you have another appointment, but that does NOT mean you can skimp on my hair. I would not go back there. They aren't as pricey as high end salons like Bladerunner (my fav) but I would pay more for a better cut. You just can't go cheap when it comes to hair.", "business_id": "faDGJ7kdZAqGSY2yXOFqRQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-10-23", "type": "review"}
