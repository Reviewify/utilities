The food is exceptional and the service is great.  Some of the appetizers that I have tried are the chilled seafood platter, the shrimp and avocado tacos,  and the tuna tartar tower and they are all delicious.  I usually get the NY strip for dinner with a side of caramelized onions and mushrooms and the steak is always perfect.  I recently went for lunch and got a blackened salmon and avocado wrap.  It was excellent.  Drinks are good too.  I know it is hard, but save room for the vesuvius flourless chocolate cake.  It is my favorite, although I don't try the others since I love this dessert so much.", "business_id": "HimyYoJuralZPoamcF_00A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-24", "type": "review"}
