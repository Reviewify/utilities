Like a lot. He did it perfectly and was like so fast! He was very nice and super chill. The guy behind the counter was a douche. Dude just cuz I don't have plugs and tattoos and a ton of piercings doesn't means you get to be a dick. Don't have an attitude when I ask a question like I'm dumb! I'd come here again but only deal with polite and nice people. I'm having a needle stuck through my face. Don't be an asshole. Prices aren't too bad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "du9U4M5k9NSgipndIW8swg"}
