Very gorgeous. The menu has a good variety. I had scallops in orange cream sauce which were good but the serving was skimpy. Their Orchid tea completely blew me away.\n\nHighly recommended for taking a date to. Be prepared to spend. Bring a light jacket if sitting outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C44mTlN9hDsy9CGlgRQ8sw"}
