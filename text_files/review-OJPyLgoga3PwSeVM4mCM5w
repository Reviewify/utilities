Clean locker rooms (women's, anyways). Great selection of cardio equipment, I love being able to vary my routine. I hesitated using the women's weight room at first (I don't know, that just seemed weird) but now I love it - nice and quiet, peaceful, no macho grunting, plenty of yoga mats and a good selection of weight machines in a quiet place so you can figure out how to use them! I took off a star because of their selection of classes - they switched over to the Les Mills classes last year and I hate them, they are all the same, commercial, even the same music every class. There's very few classes there I like - Zumba is one, but very popular, full class. There's one or 2 non LM step classes. Otherwise the Island is great, and it is wonderful seeing the inlet out the windows.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8XnaYCZxSH-K5_Bs1bIa_Q"}
