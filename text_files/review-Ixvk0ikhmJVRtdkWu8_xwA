I love the concept: it's original and very cool. However, I think there are a few kinks that the Cookie Lounge needs to fix before I'll ever visit them again.\n\nFirst of all, there's no clear \"process\" for ordering and paying for your cookie. They need to rip a page from Which Wich. \n\nNext, they quoted our wait time as 15 minutes. Seriously? 15 minutes for a cookie? Shit, it better be the best damn cookie in the world!\n\nFinally, the biggest issue, the actual cookie... I've had better. In fact, this was one of my least favorite cookies I've ever had in my life. It's only trumped by a disgusting chocolate chip cookie I had in Barcelona that tasted like dry card board with colored in chocolate bits...\n\nWe ordered two cookies: a vanilla sweet cream cookie with belgian dark chocolate chips, and a creamy brown sugar cookie with pistachio, cranberry, and white chocolate chips. The first cookie was edible, albeit, not the best cookie ever, but acceptable. \n\nThe second cookie did not fare as well. The \"creamy\" brown sugar dough tasted bland. Creamy it was not, nor was it edible. I threw most of the cookie away.\n\nLuckily, it came a la mode. Thank goodness for the teeny (and I mean teeny) scoop of Blue Bell ice cream... otherwise, this trip to campus would have been a total disappointment.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3mJyi-U08lFS2ilXCqCQKg"}
