Chill environment where people can do their own things. I come here to study or get online. I always get my roast coffee. And the staff who work there are very chill. It's a very small Starbucks and not very many tables are available. But for some reasons when I sit inside and look at all these ppl walking down on the lake avenue I feel like I'm in the east coast. I know I'm weird but sometimes I feel that way. Cool little spot:) very good for both relaxing and working on your stuff", "business_id": "jQ71WVHVsQ2A5m-V4bqRyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-30", "type": "review"}
