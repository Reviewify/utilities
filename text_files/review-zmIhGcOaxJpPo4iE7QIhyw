Chill environment where people can do their own things.\nI come here to study or get online.\nI always get my roast coffee. And the staff who work there are very chill.\nIt's a very small Starbucks and not very many tables are available.\nBut for some reasons when I sit inside and look at all these ppl walking down on the lake avenue I feel like I'm in the east coast. I know I'm weird but sometimes I feel that way.\n\nCool little spot:) very good for both relaxing and working on your stuff", "type": "review", "business_id": "jQ71WVHVsQ2A5m-V4bqRyg"}
