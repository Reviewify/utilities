I can't believe I've been by here a handful of times and never stopped in! My hubby and I were picking up his car at the dealer behind Petra and I was starving! I thought, I'm hungry and this place is near, why not? We come in and they offer us pieces of their pita bread and I was sold! I love me some good bread/pita! I got the lamb sandwich and my husband got a plain cheese pizza. Both were good, but I definitely enjoyed my sandwich! Lamb is hard to cook, you either make it good or you make it tough. They made theirs really good! It came with this cucumber/yogurt sauce which was like the whipped cream to this deliciousness. I was so full after I didn't even eat dinner, just snacked for the night! I'll definitely be more patient when my husband takes his car to the shop because I will be next door indulging!", "business_id": "-tz1m0CuiFnW9nsRTTtvOw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-05", "type": "review"}
