Delicious Mapo Tofu - the best tofu ever - and a very spicy vegetable soup with Thai Chile Oil on top. I also enjoyed my Thai Ice Tea (Sweet/Un-Sweet Tea has never tasted anything like Thai Tea...) \n\nThe food came so quickly that I had not even finished my soup when the entree arrived. I will return to try other meals. Limited outdoor dining and plenty of indoor seating.\n\nIf you like spicy food, and I do, then this should be on your 'to try' list.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gfbe0jloLHdlCflngyiUIQ"}
