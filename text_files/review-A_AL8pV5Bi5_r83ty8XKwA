I'm all about compostable \"silverware\", but not when your soup spoon gets all bendy/melty and starts making it hard to eat your soup. *sigh*\n\nThe burgers and a sandwich from the newsstand in here have made me sick, though. Blah.\n\nOh and it's dark and usually super crowded here during lunch. It's kind of an okay-spot if you're feeling lazy, but... at the same time... it's kind of sad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6LPu-7ZmGFuYbiW7xDvXDQ"}
