The special of the day is sometimes alright, the Mexican food is sometimes okay, coffee is like any other Tully's coffee on campus (super long lines just before class), there are smoothies that I've never had because I never remember it's an option, and so on.... The tomato soup and grilled cheese WOULD be an okay option if you had your own spoon or were super careful. I'm all about compostable \"silverware\", but not when your soup spoon gets all bendy/melty and starts making it hard to eat your soup. *sigh* The burgers and a sandwich from the newsstand in here have made me sick, though. Blah. Oh and it's dark and usually super crowded here during lunch. It's kind of an okay-spot if you're feeling lazy, but... at the same time... it's kind of sad.", "business_id": "6LPu-7ZmGFuYbiW7xDvXDQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-03-02", "type": "review"}
