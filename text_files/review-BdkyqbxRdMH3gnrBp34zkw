Waiting for my hair to grow out a disastrous color and cut from another salon.  Lesley did my hair.  She was very efficient.  Did the cut in an hour, taking her time and asking what I wanted again and again.  I APPRECIATE THIS!  She was very good as cutting.  Knew what she was doing.  Used a product that makes my hair look MUCH less damaged.  I need to let the damaged hair grow out before it can be cut off.  \n\nVery friendly husband of the owner.  Engaged me in conversation while I waited for Lesley to be done with her previous client.  The rest of the salon's employees, including Lesley were also very friendly and helpful.  \n\nA bonus?  It's in my hometown.  I'm going back!  Yay!", "type": "review", "business_id": "L6OpSiSJLgP6Jn7zJa_ZUg"}
