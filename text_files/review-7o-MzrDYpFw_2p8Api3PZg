The food was actually pretty good, although I think they should have more breakfast food. There was pancakes, eggs, and bacon and then everything else was lunch food. For most people I know, brunch pretty much just means breakfast at lunch time, so I was surprised to see so little breakfast stuff. I thought it was a bit overpriced...I'd say $20 would be more reasonable, rather than $23/person. I was not impressed with the service, though. Tea came out quickly, but my mimosa took quite a while to get to me. When we were up getting dessert the waiter came over to refill the water glasses, but he spilled water all over the table and didn't wipe it up. I came back to a big puddle at my seat. After we were done eating, we had to wait 15 minutes to get the check. Our waiter was bustling around setting other tables, and even when we tried to flag him down we couldn't get his attention for a while. I made sure to have my credit card out so that I could hand it right back to him when we got the bill. If we'd had to wait for him to come pick it up we'd probably still be sitting at the table waiting.", "business_id": "RThn3_Y6qN8MsqZKWa6WyQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-01", "type": "review"}
