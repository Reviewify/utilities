But, when you can have both quality and quantity it's like heaven. This is what I experienced when I dined at this fine establishment last week along with my wife. We ordered a mix of things.. the sampler appetizer, a salad, some raita, a naan and the paneer tikka masala. About 6 minutes after ordering the food started coming from the kitchen .. bam, salad.. bam, appetizer, bam bam, everything else. I looked at my wife then I looked down at the table and we both just started eating. Everything was delicious and there were even some surprises such as the middle eastern items on the appetizer that added to our enjoyment. We were unable to finish all the food so we gladly took half the naan (which was about the size of a small pizza) and half the entree home. The waitstaff was gracious and courteous and _quick_. Yeah, it was sorta crowded as others have said. I can also agree that parking in the neighborhood would be a pain, but we took the bus. I highly recommend this place. Good value for your dollar and great food.", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-04-01", "type": "review"}
