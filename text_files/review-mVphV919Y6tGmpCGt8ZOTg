Hehehe.. funfun because I found a BEAUTIFUL dress here! I was contemplating even trying it on because it was a size 12. :3 Shame on my ego for doing that because it fit pretty snuggly/wonderfully. ;) I am superduper excited to wear it this Friday! It is a tad hard to bend in, and I hope it doesn't rip. ;P It was brand new.. 100% silk.. tagged at $200.. and only $23 or so dollars. :):):) I love me a deal. The bad thing about these stores in general is that you can't return anything because the consignment money automatically goes to the original selleeeee. I don't intend on returning my goodie, but I can see how this could be problematic. .*. Anyway, this location.. in particular.. I was very happy to find an entire bottom floor devoted to discounts :D Discounts upon already discounted goodies! Props to the ladies working in this store as well because they were the ones to convince me to try on the dress. :) I really want to spend less money on food now, more on clothes + wonders... tystaforteachingmeavaluablefoodielesson!(:", "business_id": "xeiAVo9qNFkQ3zE8ZW-IFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-13", "type": "review"}
