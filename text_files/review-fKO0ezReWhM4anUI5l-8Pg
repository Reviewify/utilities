This is now my go-to place for pizza on campus, not only given its great location for me, but also fresh ingredients in more imaginative and successful juxtapositions. I love the veggie pizzas with artichokes, others with caramelized onions, and yet others with sauces and cheeses I wouldn't have come up with myself, as far as pairings. I have yet to try the other offerings of Russo, the other hot entr\u00e9es/specials, as well as the beautiful desserts. Glad it's so close by for me!", "type": "review", "business_id": "JN0Sf_2yNzzCOS5vBW3fTA"}
