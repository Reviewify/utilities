Hands Down. \n\nDon't think you are going to get a seat or have the best decor. Just come for the best pizza in Atlanta. This place is a god send for people who like really good pizza without all the bs.\n\nI love the back room and kitchen feel. Makes the food come alive.\n\n\nNot the cheapest, but the best. Plus BYOB is always a plus in my book.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ"}
