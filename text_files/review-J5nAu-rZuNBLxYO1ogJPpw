Never been to PA Bimmer before, I met with Mike. Within seconds I knew I was in the best hands. Mike took care of the tire, removing the nail and plugging it in no time. The best part other than his friendliness and courteous service? He refused to charge me for that service! A+++ service all the way. I can guarantee you I'll be bringing my car to him in the future. Thanks Mike!", "type": "review", "business_id": "31h-8EaRfZZPs32ej2r-Xw"}
