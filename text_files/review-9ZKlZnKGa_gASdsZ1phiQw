I love thE fact the salon and implements were so clean... She is very sterile which is a major plus because i took my daughter there for her first man and pedi.. She loved iiit and sherry was very patient with my 2 yr old... The parraffin wax was really great.. I love the fact that she does not double dip not to many salons do that and ive been toooo many...
