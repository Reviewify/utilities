This is one of the only places in the ENTIRE STATE to play Japanese style arcade games... specifically 2d fighters and bullet hell games.  They have melty blood and arcana heart 2!!!!!!!   If you don't know what those are, you probably won't care.  If you do know what those are, you're probably stopped reading by this point to jump in your car and drive yourself down to the arcade to get in on that action. The only downside to this place is that the locals are insanely good.  People are gonna whoop your ass.  It's all in good spirits though.  Fun times!", "business_id": "ZtIdXjQnceRzzJtUX7YRug", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-03", "type": "review"}
