Absolutely delicious food and wonderful people at work to create it. I ordered the \"Le Provencal\" sandwich today and it was perfect - delicious balance of veggies, hummus and goat cheese. Delicious, healthy food with an excellent mindset behind it - everything from the organic ingredients to the compostable containers it comes in. Definitely check out Molly's salads - it'll be worth saying \"I knew them when\" after they've blown up and become Seattle's best lunch option!", "business_id": "rQZBjywf-SFDNjokmN_v7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-27", "type": "review"}
