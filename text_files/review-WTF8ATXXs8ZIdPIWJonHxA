I ordered the \"Le Provencal\" sandwich today and it was perfect - delicious balance of veggies, hummus and goat cheese. \n\nDelicious, healthy food with an excellent mindset behind it - everything from the organic ingredients to the compostable containers it comes in.  \n\nDefinitely check out Molly's salads - it'll be worth saying \"I knew them when\" after they've blown up and become Seattle's best lunch option!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rQZBjywf-SFDNjokmN_v7w"}
