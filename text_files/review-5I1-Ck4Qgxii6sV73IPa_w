The beers are top notch (with very few exceptions). I could drink their IPAs, Coal Creek Porter, or Old Rip all day. The bartenders are awesome too.\n\nTheir kitchen serves up standard pub grub that ranges from OK to pretty good. If you need a meal go for a pizza or sandwich. If you're looking for a snack chips and salsa is the way to go. I don't know how they do it, but the salsa is excellent.\n\nNever crowded (except when Old Wooley is first tapped) and completely free of the Greek system (it's too far for them to walk) that pervades the slightly more northern establishments on the Ave. This is a place to just come and hang out with your friends or by yourself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WxUTo2tUjcN5AxA6UzRFfw"}
