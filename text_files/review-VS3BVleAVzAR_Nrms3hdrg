You place your order, get a number and wait for it to be called.  This system works flawlessly at delis across the country but not here...because its impossible to understand the numbers being called out.  This results in people standing around staring at the counter waiting for their food in the exact space that you wait in line to order.  Either get a new pa system or ditch it altogether.  \n\nThe food was pretty plain.  I got the beef kabob which was overcooked to the point of being jerky and completely lacked any seasoning at all.  The meal is served cold, so if that's not your thing then you're out of luck.  The pasta and cous cous tasted like they had been sitting out all day drying out, because they had.\n\nMost of the tables are occupied by people who have finished their meal hours ago and are completely oblivious to the lunchtime crowd as they stare out the front window, daydreaming of the crappy restaurant they will eat at tomorrow.  Either all the cashiers are new employees or have no idea how to operate the registers and the grill is about the size of a george foreman, adding to the overall sluggish service.\n\nCome here if you enjoy bad Mediterranean food and have infinite patience, don't come here if you consider yourself to be remotely intelligent and/or desire a satisfying meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rjW33uw9o5k1x5SlRaZfng"}
