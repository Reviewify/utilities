I take visitors and overnight guests here for brunch almost religiously.  Here's what comes with the $5.50 Huevos Rancheros:   1) Two eggs over easy   2) A small salad   3) Chips and salsa   4) Six warm tortillas    5) Enough rice and beans to be its own meal It's good, too. Real good. Not fall-out-of-your-seat good, but so much good food for $5.50 that I feel like I'm stealing. I usually take home enough for a second meal.  Their menu recommends a 10% tip. I always tip generously. After all, I feel like they lose money when I show up.", "business_id": "DGPkpfu9hm-ETpU6jL-ujQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-06-14", "type": "review"}
