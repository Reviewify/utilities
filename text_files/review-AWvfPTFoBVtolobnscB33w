So much food. I take visitors and overnight guests here for brunch almost religiously. \n\nHere's what comes with the $5.50 Huevos Rancheros:\n\n  1) Two eggs over easy\n  2) A small salad\n  3) Chips and salsa\n  4) Six warm tortillas \n  5) Enough rice and beans to be its own meal\n\nIt's good, too. Real good. Not fall-out-of-your-seat good, but so much good food for $5.50 that I feel like I'm stealing. I usually take home enough for a second meal. \n\nTheir menu recommends a 10% tip. I always tip generously. After all, I feel like they lose money when I show up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DGPkpfu9hm-ETpU6jL-ujQ"}
