Perfect for a quick trip and a nice gift.  \n\nNice workers, sometimes they even let you take a couple extra for free or take a small cutting of a plant to grow at home.\n\nThis place won't blow your socks off, better to go to the brattle florist for that, but it will make a thoughtful gesture a little sunnier.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eNgzDtYCpDrQh1lCMTZU0Q"}
