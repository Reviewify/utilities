You are struck by the white furnishings as you walk in, and the funky lights offer a scene that I'm sure was cutting edge a few years ago. The place looks a little passe now, but that doesn't affect the food. The sushi is high quality and there are ample selections of dim sum, more \"traditional\" chinese dishes, and a few other asian dishes such as crab pad thai. The food was great, well prepared, and bursting with flavor. The miso seabass was so soft it melted off my chopsticks. Pod has many innovative takes on more traditional dishes like mushroom dumplings in a marsala like sauce and the aforementioned crab pad thai. I wasn't thrilled with the dessert menu but the wait staff let us try a small portion of the toffee-chocolate bread pudding, which was incredible. The worst part of the restaurant was trying to figure out what to order since the menu is so good. The truth be told though, the worst part of the Pod is the prices which are very high even for the large portions. Service was extremely attentive, there are a large selection of cocktails and wine as well.", "business_id": "3gVSrS4kffGGZT8oXHsIcw", "stars": 4, "date": "2005-09-26", "type": "review"}
