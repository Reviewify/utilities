The first time my experience was awful. What I ordered was uneatable and I sent it back and asked that it not be returned. We ordered the fried mushrooms as an appetizer and loved them! The second visit I decided to play it safe and ordered a simple sandwich. It was bland and I didn't enjoy it very much. Again, we ordered the mushrooms and they were fantastic! The third visit was so much better. I ordered the fish taco lunch combo with chips and salsa and French onion soup. The French onion soup was really good. They didn't throw a bunch of croutons in it which is a plus in my book. The fish taco was really good too. I asked for extra chipolte sauce which made it that much better. The chips and salsa were OK. The chips were good but the salsa was on the bland side. I also think it is somewhat pricey for lunch. If you are looking for a better lunch deal then go to Friday's where they offer a lot more lunch combos at a much better price. I will go back here again. Especially with a group so we can order the mushrooms again. They are so good. Word of warning though, they are big and I think you get 6 or 8 of them. You will need help eating them.", "business_id": "RQxLNvAra_MUUPHdhukilA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-12-03", "type": "review"}
