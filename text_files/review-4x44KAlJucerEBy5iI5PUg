But dinner this past Saturday was exceptional. And I believe what made it exceptional was our server, Adam. I can't put my finger on any one thing that Adam did that was special, but he made the evening very enjoyable. He was very attentive to my wife's pickey needs (\"medium-well please...\") and made sure our wine glass was never empty. In addition, we had a window-seat over the water where we saw the \"Water Fire\" for the first time. OK, that was kind of wierd, but it was enjoyable. Except for the smoke after we exited the restaurant. In sum, a great restaurant with a great server, Adam - all the ingredients for a great evening.", "business_id": "kATS8uEAIQfeD66JypmgaQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-11-03", "type": "review"}
