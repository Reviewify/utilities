Larry was a deft server and had helpful suggestions for wine and appetizers. Will be back to try the burgers - the lamb burger looked fab! Music was a little loud for my taste, had to lean over the table to hear each other and it was early - uncrowned 6:00pm dinner. Also had the front door open so I had to keep my wrap on as it was chilly. Prices are reasonable, especially for the powerhouse entree. Overall a nice experience; we'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v13Ur9Yf2EhvGlvPAaFNeQ"}
