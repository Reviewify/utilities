Come early so you can claim good seating and set up your blankies close to the screen x) Bring cash for parking, entry and food trucks.\n\nBRING LOTS OF BLANKETS and also pillows so you're not constantly in a crunch position when you're lying back on the grass while you're watching the movie... my abs got a pretty good workout. I brought two blankets for me and one other friend and it wasn't enough! Probably because it was breezy too... But better to be over prepared than under prepared.\n\nGreat selection of food trucks, there were also a handful of vendors there.\n\nAlso bring sunblock and something to do while you're babysitting your spot on the grass. I brought a book, some people brought cards, some brought booze.... hehe. And the A Rockin Ice truck is a must!!!!!!!\n\nHave fun :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "BPT-D30wcq-_SOU8pY6zTw"}
