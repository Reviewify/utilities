My biggest complaint is this place is so dirty. I was afraid to drink the water, but thats just me. However, their Thai iced tea is pretty good. I can't say that I would go here again, but it was worth a try.  Also, this place is pretty cheap( around $8 or so)", "type": "review", "business_id": "QdganL5AW9E_fNoRVroLig"}
