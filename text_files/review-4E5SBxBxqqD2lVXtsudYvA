Although I am, you don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the food here - I've come here with non veggies and they've been really pleased with their meals.  I seriously dream of their hot and sour soup, its the best soup I think I've ever had, very spicy and a really exotic mix of mushrooms, and its really filling so you may want to split an entree or just stick with another app (this coming from someone who can usually ALWAYS clear her plate). Another fav is the stir fried spinach linguine, and their guac is so good I get a to-go portion of it to bring home for $3.  Its BYOB which is sweet, although buy a bottle before resorting to the wine store next door, which is crazy overpriced.", "type": "review", "business_id": "03w8pzPbE51xMi8rdlvYWg"}
