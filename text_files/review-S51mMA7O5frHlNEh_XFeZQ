It's a very good place to hang out, play games, lounge around, etc. The thing about this place is that it is in such a good location, it is heavily populated by UW students and some high school students, too.  Their service is pretty good for the most part, but they do take a little longer than most BBT places to prepare the drinks. The quality of bubble tea is pretty good but I've gotten random tea leaves in my cold drinks before. Their hot bubble tea drinks are actually really good, and great for those cold winter days after studying in DC. I also had my birthday there last year, they reserved 4 or 5 tables for us and were very prepared.  Their menu keeps growing, I really recommend Icy Swirls. The food menu is typical BBT food. Sweet Dreams isn't the best place to have good food, it's sort of just an extra that they have. Plus, for the past couple years they've been hiring a lot of Caucasians. They also sell some over-priced merchandise, and hold events from time to time, i.e. open-mic.  Overall a great place to chill with friends, I guess it's the asian equivalent of WIlliams, which is in the same plaza.", "business_id": "Fy1XzG9pBh3DtB0POjkQsg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-26", "type": "review"}
