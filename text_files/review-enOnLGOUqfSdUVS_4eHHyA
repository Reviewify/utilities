Rather than wait for a table my boyfriend and I ate at the bar which I did enjoy because it changed things up a bit. The house cocktails were old schooly- I had the drink with Makers Mark and my bf the Manhattan. The food was excellent as was the atmosphere/ decor. Kind of an old NY feel. We ordered a house salad, seared sea scallop appetizer- quite good. And for dinner the sausage ragout and skirt steak- both super flavorful and yummy and a side of onion rings. We ordered dessert- the apple tatin which was also very good. Being at the bar we also tried the \"house chips\" which I am a big fan now. The bartender- a young blonde girl was also super personable and friendly. We found out that the restaurant was started by 2 brothers and that much of the food is grown/ raised locally. Oh and I hear they have live jazz on Thursdays. I will def. be back! ... and we have since I originally drafted this review.  Still 4 stars!", "business_id": "dz1qvyImYe6lG-UEU0VkTQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-27", "type": "review"}
