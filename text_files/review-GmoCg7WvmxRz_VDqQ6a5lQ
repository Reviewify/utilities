The only problem is they NEVER have enough people working here. I've never waited less than 15 minutes in line just to order :( so don't come when you're in a rush. I always get burritos and have yet to try anything else. But I've realized they are a lot more filing than what you think they will be! I get the freebird burrito, which is a little smaller than the Chipotle size, but it is definitely filling! Also, go for the steak, chicken doesn't have much flavor to it! P.S. The mild green salsa at the salsa bar is awesome on chips and in your burrito!", "business_id": "qG4njyS8j8an-alwNFflMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-04", "type": "review"}
