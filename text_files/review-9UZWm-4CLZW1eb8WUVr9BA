So that must say something about the quality of what I've found and settled upon: The avocado turkey has a tasteful amount of sour cream (doesn't make you feel icky like a mouthful from a not-sufficiently-diversified burrito bite), which is the secret to it's consistency.   I guess some say there's a secret ingredient, but I don't like that very much, I guess my secret irrational fear is that the secret ingredient is spit from the head chef (who is the only irreplaceable cog in the machine hmmmm) or hair from the cat out back (that's why no other restaurant has it), and ok maybe i've just ruined secret ingredients for you for the rest of your life, but hey, maybe they're keeping IT hidden from the public for a REASON. If there is a secret ingredient, it is delicious, but I think the oomph added by the sour cream is all the mojo they need.     The split pea soup is so thick, and speaks for itself.  I don't have enough experience with various degrees of split pea soup, so no connoisseurial yammer, but, yah, it's flavorful and filling (for a soup). Nothing really wrong with the place, and the sandwiches are rich and wonderful, but as far as sandwich places go, this doesn't get the 5th star.  (Maybe I just get off on being withholding)", "business_id": "PUK0RoIvq8pgi38FSCg7cQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-08-21", "type": "review"}
