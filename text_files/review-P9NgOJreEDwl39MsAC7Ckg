I was impressed with the array of beers and games. The food vendors were also quality. Ormsby's was there with their sausages/bratwurst offerings. I had a tasty jerk chicken sandwich at the stand next to Ormsby's that was reasonably priced and huge. I wanted to do the funhouse mirror, but that thing was packed all day long. Were the lines for the bathroom long? Sure, but it's a festival--that's par for the course. I found beer all the way up until the end of the festival without too much trouble, so I'm not sure why others are suggesting they \"ran out\" of beer 2 hours early. (Yes, some individual tables ran out of beer, but not the whole festival.) More water access and maybe carby cheap eats (pretzels, crackers) might be a good idea for next year. But again, awesome festival that I'll definitely be coming back to again.", "business_id": "kAdooEXG26HrltXkyRI9Nw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-21", "type": "review"}
