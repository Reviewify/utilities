(yes, some individual tables ran out of beer, but not the whole festival.) more water access and maybe carby cheap eats (pretzels, crackers) might be a good idea for next year. but again, awesome festival that i'll definitely be coming back to again.", "business_id": "kAdooEXG26HrltXkyRI9Nw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-21", "type": "review"}
