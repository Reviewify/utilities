Very unique crowd (probably didn't help that the hair show was in town- HEEEEEEEEEEEEY) But we loved it. Service was attentive for a Friday night... and there was 6 of us! Food was really good for bar food. I got the tacos. These were really really good. I got scallop, shrimp, and calamari. YUM! Burgers, seafood, drinks and more. def a place to check out!!!", "business_id": "cEC3lx06tjhMOAomZnD1Sw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-01", "type": "review"}
