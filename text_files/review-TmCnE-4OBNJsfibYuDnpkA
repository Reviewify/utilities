What I would like to address is the bizarre reputation this place has here as a \"hipster\" restaraunt. THe only reason this label would be appropriate would be if, by \"hipster\", you refer to any casually dressed 20 or 30 something without a spray tan. On any given night i would say 3%-5% of the clientele here would fit my idea of a hipster... tattoos, piercings, americn apparel/urban outfitters wardrobe. The majority of the people who hang out here are betweem the ages of 20-50 and are mostly either grad students or employees of the various tech firms in Kendall square. They are wearing business casual or jeans, which is entirely appropriate for the tavern style atmosphere. This place is hardly Williamsburg. Granted It isn't Clery's either, and if you are most comfortable in the exclusive company of Hearty besuited executives and girls with flippy blonde hair and stillettos then you should probably stay downtown. But please dont call this a hipster bar. Its unfair both to those of us who do enjoy it and to hipsters.", "business_id": "A3D8gBGNmt51kvcI0GkaGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-03", "type": "review"}
