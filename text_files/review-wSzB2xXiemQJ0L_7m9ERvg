But, I can't bring myself to. I cannot believe that it took me so long to try this. I shared a large 4 scoop ice cream with my husband. We had:\n\n- Coconut: AHHH so good, my favorite of the four flavors. It tasted fresh, it punched me in the face. \n- Coffee: creamy, and good but it wasn't my favorite.\n- Peanut butter: delicious with tiny bits of peanuts found everywhere. When mixed with the dark chocolate below  - heaven\n- Dark Chocolate: SO rich. This flavor rocked me off my seat. Jett T. : you got it right, it was all quality\n\nSo expensive though. So worth the splurge", "type": "review", "business_id": "y0xTHTPtxXTctQEKWVuGpg"}
