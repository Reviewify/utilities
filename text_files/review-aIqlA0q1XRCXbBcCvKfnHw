I enjoyed it immensly! :) I got my hair cut and styled by Marie. She just returned from her honeymoon all refreshed and chatty. She was a delight. Marie was very gentle and was very attentive. I cut ~ 4\" off and I was quite nervous. She did exactly what I had explained to her. As she was finishing up she let me check the back to make sure I liked it. I plan to come back... especially for my coloring because that is what they are known for.", "business_id": "L6OpSiSJLgP6Jn7zJa_ZUg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-02", "type": "review"}
