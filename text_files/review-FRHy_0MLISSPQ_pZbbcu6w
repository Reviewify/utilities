We brought our dog and sat outside - the staff was extremely responsive, bringing her a bowl of water and dog treats without us asking.  We ordered the reuben, an omelet and split a chocolate malt (they are huge).  The reuben was really excellent and not greasy at all.  My fiance was also very happy with her omelet.  And of course the malt was great - how could you goof that up? We were very pleased overall and will definitely be back.", "business_id": "KG3Y2qyrru2SZxR_c5gHyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-30", "type": "review"}
