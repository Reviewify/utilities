Sometimes it's only a few minutes, but sometimes its as much as an hour.  Now they introduced a call ahead service, but they haven't advertised it much.  The wait is long, but the food is delicious.  BJ's is probably my favorite of the casual dining college crowd franchise restaurants (TGIF, Chili's, etc.), most because they offer excellent brews.  It's too bad this location got rid of their brewing equipment, and they only have their barrels for show now.  Regardless... give me a baked potato or burger and a beer, and I'm so happy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "FjmEYsEtRNaerkOjh07wSQ"}
