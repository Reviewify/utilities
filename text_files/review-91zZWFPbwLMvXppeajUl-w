On the corner of Bancroft and College, this is really a great location to have a cafe. I usually go here in the mornings when I have free time to do a little studying before my classes. It often gets crowded around rush hour before people head to work and whatnot, but with 3 cashiers behind the counter, service is really quick. Also, service is top notch. Never have I had my order messed up, and the people behind the counter are always cheerful.  The inside of Strada doesn't seat that many people so often times, I find myself sitting on one of the many tables outside but this hasn't been a problem at all. On cold days, they turn the head lamps on and its just as good outside as it is inside.  For breakfast, I usually stop by to get a cinnamon roll and a Americano. The cinnamon roll isn't the greatest and most freshest roll, but it gets me through my morning.  For the atmosphere alone, this place deserves a four star.", "business_id": "_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-15", "type": "review"}
