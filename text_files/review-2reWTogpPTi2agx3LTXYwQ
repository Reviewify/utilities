They have a social and dynamic atmosphere complemented by that San Franciscan modern aura that keeps people working on their homework for hours at a time.  Their selection of foods is a bit limited but the quality compensates. The coffee's great, the seating is comfortable and there's a plethora of plug outlets.  The people are often easy to approach, so you can take a break between chapters and get to know someone that's interesting. It's a fantastic way to get work done without unproductive interruptions. Great for students and faculty!", "business_id": "DO1Ukiuia9hs33VTnTY_Jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-08-10", "type": "review"}
