For those of you who aren't familiar with Chipotle, it's very similar to Subway in how you can choose what you want in your burrito or salad. I've always had friendly service at this location and have had no problems with their food at all. I usually get the Steak Fajita Burrito with basically everything inside. Nothing's wrong with putting everything you can in your burrito if you can right?! Then to top it off, it tastes even better with some Chipotle Tabasco sauce to spice it up a bit. When going to this location, be aware that it WILL be crowded during Lunch and Dinner, so try to go at an awkward hour if you're trying to avoid a long line. Being right next to UCLA, you'll be running into a lot of students, as well as business people eating here.", "business_id": "JtQI62zBQWmXOIUT2_RoIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-06", "type": "review"}
