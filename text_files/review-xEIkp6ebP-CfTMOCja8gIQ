Service is the same, hit or miss. This place caters more to the \"oyster, lobster bisque\" foodie and not the generic \"catfish, salmon\" foodie. I find myself going here a lot more during Lent because of the aversion to meat during that period. For that, it serves its seafood (no meat) purpose. Side Note - I don't understand why they randonmly open the door in cold weather without asking the customers if they want the door open. If they did ask, odds are the answer would be no, because it's freezing. You'd think the Southern hospitality in them would have caused them to ask their customers first. Tsk. Tsk. It's happened to me twice now, once by the owner.", "business_id": "ztY4uPNUTWMN9LT3L5mD3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-03-09", "type": "review"}
