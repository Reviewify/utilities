A year out of Boston and it's the one place I think about most often. I must have been here hundreds of times and seen hundreds of great shows here. This place is Boston legend. All the bands I talk to seem to have a Middle East Story and everyone remembers seeing someone way back when they played here or when they saw so and so play a surprise show here. The stage is close enough to let the audience be a part of the show yet the security isn't oppressive. They look out for everyone and keep the place safe. Very easy to get tickets here. There is a good show at least every week so you'll be back a lot. There are two stages, one behind the restaurant area and one downstairs. The Upstairs is more slower, folky stuff while downstairs is anything goes. They have bellydancing in the corner (the restaurant) too. The bar is great and they serve Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food though I've never eaten there. With all the good rock clubs in Boston closing to turn into college bars, Middle East is one of the last good refuges for a good night of hard music and drinking with your friends. Not to mention when Scissorfight plays there the place goes crazy.", "business_id": "YFkrZhuA1phCiJB1EJV39w", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-05-24", "type": "review"}
