My date and I went here for lunch for Restaurant Month. We were seated in a completely empty restaurant on a Sunday at 12:30, which seems a little weird, but okay. The servers were really nice, and the service was prompt throughout. What was less impressive was the food. My tofu was tasty, but not really special. My date got eel, which he also seemed to think taste mediocre. The portions were a decent size - not huge, but good enough ... if only the food were also \"good enough.\" I'm glad we came for the restaurant month menu (15 for two courses); regularly, a la carte dishes cost about that amount alone, but definitely would NOT have been worth it. The ambiance gets 5 stars. The food ... 2? The value, 1 (or zero). It deserves some mention, though, that they are pretty vegetarian and celiac friendly.", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-27", "type": "review"}
