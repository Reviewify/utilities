And then found myself there again last night. There's a ton of flavors available, which can be a mixed blessing when you're feeling indecisive. I usually wind up getting a little bit of anything that interests me. And at only 39 cents an ounce, this strategy seems to work in my favor. The first time I went here the Taro flavor was off, alarmingly so. I haven't tried it again because I'm afraid to - hence four stars instead of five. My favorites so far: -Green tea: the tanginess hits you over the head at first, but then mellows into a delicious sweetness. -Fan-tachio (aka pistachio): ignore its almost neon color - if you like pistachio ice cream you'll be a fan fo sho. -Chocolate craving (with no sugar added...and I'm pretty sure it's also nonfat!): definitely sated my hankering for chocolate, and with a sprinkling of shredded coconut it reminded me of a guilt-free Mounds bar! Definitely beats that disgusting TCBY on MLK any day. Plus, anyone that offers mochi is an automatic hero in my book.
