Since I was in the area doing Yelp Eats errands, I pulled into Antone's for a quick sammy.\n\nQuick sammy indeed. I walked in, grabbed a Diet Coke from the cooler, walked over to the pre-made sandwiches and snagged a tuna po-boy, paid and was out the door. \n\nThis tuna was rockin': pickles, spiced up tuna with a cajun kick, and no overload of mayo. It had a slice a cheese, which threw me off (fish and cheese freak me out), but I was so hungry, I ate it any way. And you know what? It wasn't bad at all.\n\nI want to stop by another time and take look at their cheeses, hummus, and creative wraps. Thanks for feeding my belly, Antone's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "K8v4s2WYnnYr7ouRSpC1rA"}
