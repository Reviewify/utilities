I can honestly say its my first choice when I'm choosing where to eat in the area. My boyfriend loves the white pizza but I opt for the minestrone soup and caesar salad. They bring your order right to your table and the soup & salad look like they've came straight from a 5 star Restaurant, a awesome presentation for a classic \"fast food\" type of place. The soup is better than anywhere I've experienced and I am a minestrone soup fiend. My small salad is always huge and almost too much for me to eat, while you definitely need to go for the large soup! I can never get enough. I can't wait to try their pasta in the future, I'm just so obsessed with the soup and salad that I haven't strayed yet. So many italian selections in this menu and you can tell they put a lot of effort in making them perfectly! They also have a huge bottled beer selection which is awesome if you want to watch a game on their flat screen tv! My favorite thing about this place is the service, the staff is friendly and is very helpful... They even remembered me the second time i went in, they make my experience a joy! I couldn't find a better place to enjoy a meal that is well over worth the price! Restaurant quality food in a classic pizzeria! Its safe to say i'm hooked :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "XqKhC29UQ1ya1Py3bTzvAA"}
