They have a great kids' area in the back which is also enjoyable for adults.  The new African area is different because they spend a lot of space on atmosphere and not so many animals.  \nBecause many of the animals get more space in their habitats, you don't always get to see the critters you came to see.  You also have to consider the temperatures before you go.  While they have several \"houses\" to go into with a/c, most of the zoo has you walking around outside in the heat.  Bring a hat, sunscreen and lots of water when you go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rsEJu-ANPOBdSaR4ikLHgg"}
