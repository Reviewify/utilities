It was a Saturday at around 5pm.  Service and atmosphere were great.  Seating was outdoors which was nice on a Sat summer afternoon.   I wasn't in the mood for a beer for some reason so I went with an Arnold Palmer to start.  That was great.  I ordered a small pomme frites and the abbey burger.  The pomme frites were eh...ok.  I guess my expectations were too high, I just had some pomme frites from a place names Duckfat in Portland, ME two weeks ago and those were the best ever.  These didn't really come close.  I mean they were good, just not as good as what I have had recently.  The burger was good too, but I'm not sure what people are saying on here that it is better than Father's Office.  I honestly, don't think so.  My girlfriend just brought me home a half of a fathers office burger, and I warmed it up and ate it the next morning and it was better than the Abbey Burger.  \n\nWith all of that said, I did enjoy the place and the rest of the menu looked promising.  The service was really friendly and welcoming and it does seem like a cool place to hang out.  I would go back, but not for the frites or the abbey burger.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81IjU5L-t-QQwsE38C63hQ"}
