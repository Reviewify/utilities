The meat selection is lacking. It has everything that a basic grocery store has (junk food, dairy, etc, household items), but it also has the high-quality items that Whole Foods has (organic and gourmet items). The prepared food is superior, and the Asian buffet is pretty good. I like the decor, it feels like you're in an Italian market.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RCGryVRZqKvnDH4Yyhhe8w"}
