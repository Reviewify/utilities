I crave it even when I'm not in the city of Pittsburgh. It's pretty satisfying, even though it clearly is unhealthy to eat too many times in one week. The fries are only free if you eat there - you have to order it for take out. The bacon cheeseburger is my favorite sub, but the special is pretty good as well. I hear the salads are decent, too. Cash only. Parking is best over at the lot across the street, under the library.", "business_id": "IhjrIdQkNgXIobdKg6eFmg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-08-26", "type": "review"}
