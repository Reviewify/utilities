I am not much of a comic book person, but the selection here is great. I talked to Reid and he led in the the right direction of some things that I would like. The staff is helpful and the ambiance is great, clean and bright. Makes it very easy to come back to see what is new each week.", "business_id": "DDN9pnYwuC16wWrSfkV1AQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-01", "type": "review"}
