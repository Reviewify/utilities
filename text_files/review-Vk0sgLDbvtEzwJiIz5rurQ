I am not much of a comic book person, but the selection here is great. I talked to Reid and he led in the the right direction of some things that I would like. \n\nThe staff is helpful and the ambiance is great, clean and bright. Makes it very easy to come back to see what is new each week.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DDN9pnYwuC16wWrSfkV1AQ"}
