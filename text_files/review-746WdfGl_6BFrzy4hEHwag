The food is quick, cheap and very tasty. While not a gourmet restaurant by a loooong shot, I have never had a meal that wasn't satisfying. And the staff is AMAZING! They are friendly & helpful, and they remember you when you come back. It sort of feels like eating over at a friend's house, and in the very good way. The atmosphere is cozy and casual. I also can't believe the complaints about the portions of the lunch. Americans just eat too much. I've had the lunch special, and it is small. But it is perfect for a quick, light, affordable lunch. The dinner portions are also smaller than you might expect for a restaurant meal, but they are an appropriate size for a dinner. I will continue to go to this restaurant on a regular basis, and I would recommend that people give it a chance. It might not be for everyone, but I don't think it deserves 1star. This is a great little local place the deserves a try.", "business_id": "fhizCa69lP1RS8yHJUUBSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-15", "type": "review"}
