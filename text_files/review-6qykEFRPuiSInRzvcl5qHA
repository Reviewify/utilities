The lighting set the mood and was perfect for dinner after a long day in the office. The restaurant wasn't overcrowded or noisy. The waitress was friendly and very welcoming. I got the vegetarian platter and it was more than enough food. Each item was very delicious and full of flavor. The food took a while to come out considering it wasn't that busy but, my friend and I didn't mind because it gave us more time to talk and catch up. I would definitely come here again.", "business_id": "Znl2P0iZNNHXxvf5jQRKAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-02", "type": "review"}
