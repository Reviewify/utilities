I would acually say the food is NYC quality Indian Food (meaning as good as as an average place in NYC, but not equal to the better ones).  I find the service pleasnat too...   But like some have noctied I am a low rater, so this translates to three stars. ...   I see a good many Indian people eating here too.", "business_id": "VZNKj35pKzs-fR8_CMPrgA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-21", "type": "review"}
