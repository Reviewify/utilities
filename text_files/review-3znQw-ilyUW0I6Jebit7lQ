I just know that mochas are tasty. My mocha is served in a glass mug. It keeps me warm while I study. I don't know about this snobby baristas I've been reading about. They might not be Starbucks-friendly. I'm not really looking to make my barista my BFFL (best friend for life). My mocha satisfies me.\n\nWhat I love about Cafe Allegro is this: three separate spaces. Four, if you want to count the outdoors. I walk in, and 3 eager faces look up from laptops as if I were the prophet. I don't know why people are always staring when I walk in. I'm just the run-of-the-mill, small Asian girl. This room is loud. I order my mocha. And take it somewhere else.\n\nAcross the hallway is nice. Globes...stools...etc. But upstairs, if you brave the cold, is even better. And there's a balcony! How to get upstairs, you ask? Simple, find a portal. Step into it. Not really.\n\nHere's how (though I might come after you within the next seven days if you ruin my peaceful, secret room): exit Allegro. Find the door between the two parts of the downstairs cafe. Or, start at the main entrance and proceed to next door (North?). Walk  up the stairs. It isn't rocket science.\n\nCafe Allegro is hidden because the building next to it is new (around 2008 or 2009?). So people shouldn't be complaining about Cafe Allegro...they should be complaining about the new building. Cafe Allegro used to have a prime view of a parking lot across from UW!\n\n5 stars for a study space, a mocha that keeps me satisfied, and a readily available pitcher of water.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G_xjBimSuQ73gEg1wYDacA"}
