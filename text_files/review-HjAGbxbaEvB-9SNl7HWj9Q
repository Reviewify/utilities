They always greet my dogs and give them treats, I think my dogs know they'll get treats as they approach the counter now because they get so excited. The Science diet comes in all sizes of bags and I'm thankful for that since my dogs go through so much of it so fast. It's great to see that they have such a big size for it, I can't find that at Petco even if I wanted to.", "business_id": "Hr597HbGWAp9UbF2JyhOgQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-12", "type": "review"}
