One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants by far.  The skewered lamb was so tender and delicious, a knife wasn't needed.  Equally as good were the chicken skewers, salad with the freshest, crunchiest vegetables and a light dressing,  grape leaves, hoummous, falalel, etc...I'm still salivating as I write this....The only downfall is that they are not located close to my office so I could enjoy all they offer on a weekly basis.", "business_id": "AHC01qlTiuHn-pHVQ_4DGQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-19", "type": "review"}
