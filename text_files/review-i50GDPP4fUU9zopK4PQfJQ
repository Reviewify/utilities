Along with Pisticci, this is the best Italian food in the Heights. \n\nI dig the warm vibe, the friendly service, the cheap pastas and affordable carafes of vino. \n\nThe only thing I don't dig about this place is that it only takes cash. What is up with that? \n\nUsually that's not  a big deal but last night I had dinner here, and the cash only took me by surprise. \n\nStill, with only $40 in hand, my friend and I were able to share a pasta, calamari and a carafe and the cash covered us and afforded a nice tip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w"}
