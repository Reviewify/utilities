It's pretty much like any other Mongolian BBQ place you see in the malls where they cook your food in front of you on the round hot stone. \n\nYou pack your own bowl with raw meat and veggies, then at the end of the line one of the guys will pack on a ton of noodles for you. I always pack my meat up to what I think is the bowl's maximum capacity, but they somehow always manage to add on another bowl's worth of noodles on top. This place is not stingy at all!!\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that they'll add in all the sauces for you and it's hard to tell them exactly how much of which sauce you want...but overall this place is still great!", "type": "review", "business_id": "T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ"}
