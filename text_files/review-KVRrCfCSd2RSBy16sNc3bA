Some sites had rated it #1 in Boston for breakfast.\n\nWow - what a mistake.\n\nOrdered the pancakes + strawberries and my friend ordered the \"Kitchen Sink\" quesadilla and the eggs benedict. We shared an order of onion rings as an appetizer.\n\nI've had better pancakes out of a box and the sauces on the quesadilla were indiscernible & unpalatable quite frankly.\n\nThe hollandaise sauce was sour & didn't taste right according to my friend. Although once scraped off the poached egg, \"virginia ham\", and  english muffin, were decent.\n\nI will say that the onion rings are actually pretty good, and for $4.50 they give you a huge plate full.\n\nWe visited on a muggy night and either their a/c was not working or not turned on which coupled with the worst \"music\" ever playing over the tinny speakers made for a very unpleasant experience. The atmosphere would jump leaps & bounds if they decided to just not play any music at all.\n\nWon't even make mention of the nonexistent service - oh wait I just did.\n\nThe place has potential - but I'd advise you stay away.\n\nI'm serious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A"}
