Some sites had rated it #1 in Boston for breakfast. Wow - what a mistake. Ordered the pancakes + strawberries and my friend ordered the \"Kitchen Sink\" quesadilla and the eggs benedict. We shared an order of onion rings as an appetizer. I've had better pancakes out of a box and the sauces on the quesadilla were indiscernible & unpalatable quite frankly. The hollandaise sauce was sour & didn't taste right according to my friend. Although once scraped off the poached egg, \"virginia ham\", and english muffin, were decent. I will say that the onion rings are actually pretty good, and for $4.50 they give you a huge plate full. We visited on a muggy night and either their a/c was not working or not turned on which coupled with the worst \"music\" ever playing over the tinny speakers made for a very unpleasant experience. The atmosphere would jump leaps & bounds if they decided to just not play any music at all. Won't even make mention of the nonexistent service - oh wait I just did. The place has potential - but I'd advise you stay away. I'm serious.", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-04", "type": "review"}
