The dark chocolate is perfectly smooth, the caramel is creamy, and the sea salt complements the sweetness of the caramel. It just melts in your mouth. As an added plus, these chocolates only have 50 calories each!!! I have to say that they are my ultimate favorite chocolates.  I'm always craving Fran's, but there aren't any locations in California :( I was able to find Fran's at a small grocery store in Napa, but I'm on a search for a store closer to me that sells their chocolates.", "business_id": "Jyo7e8mYJGwVQKBHqCUvTA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-06", "type": "review"}
