But, I am giving you two stars because you charge me extra for a splash of soy milk and that is retarded.  I literally use a tablespoon of soymilk.  Your coffee is overpriced and too small to begin with, but then charging me $.50 extra for a splash of soy makes me hate you.  No other coffee place I have been to  does this.  Yes, places charge extra for a soy latte and that is stupid, but I get it because you are using a lot of soy.", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-29", "type": "review"}
