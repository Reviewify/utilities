It's one of those places that I've gone to many o' times wanting everything and then walking away with nothing. A girl's gotta discipline herself every now and then, you know. \n\nOn every occasion that I've visited Langford since it opened in February 2007, I've always had such a pleasant experience with the helpful female staff. I'm not much of a fashionista, so when they ask if I need help, I give a stern, \"hellz yeah.\" My most recent visit was last week. I was in search of a particular style of dress. I spent almost an hour trying on everything, and my helpful little lady even pulled other dresses and accessories she thought I'd like. It was like having my owner personal shopper. I ended up with a sassy little fall number.\n\nAt Langford Market, you'll find an assortment of jeans, sexy button ups, tunics, skirts, body suits, lingerie, dazzling purses, retro furniture... They also carry a ton of belts, jewelry, scarves (though I couldn't find a simple black cashmere), and shoes (though no boots for now.) It's a plus that only a few size per style can be found; you don't want to spot some gal wearing YOUR outfit and go through a \"who wore it better moment?\" That always sucks.\n\nMy only gripe: the dressing room \"doors\"; they're curtains. I despise those! When there's a man--who's not your man--who's sitting outside waiting for his little lady, you sure as hell know he's probably peeping through the sides tha won't close all the way. Creepy. I'd advise at least adding those little suction cup things to stick to the side walls like American Apparel has.  \n\nReturn policy is only within 14 days, and for store credit only.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R3i_rrYhJHWmZxfNXIuP6Q"}
