Been on my map for a while now, and then reality hits. After our hike in Eaton canyon, the GF and I decide that burgers are cool.  Make the drive down and one of the challenges of Pasadena takes effect.  Where to park.  Across the street was only 1hr parking and the parking in front of the place was full.  Finally found parking on a side street. Inside, it's a small diner.  Not many people were in there, so we stood there waiting for info.  Finally a waitress told us we could sit anywhere we wanted.  Now, I'm notorious for not carrying cash and there was a sign that said \"Cash or Check\".  Lucky for me, I had some on me that day. The menu is very simple and they only offer two styles of burgers; cheese or no cheese.  Can't get much simpler than that. I got a reg. burger and the GF got the cheese burger, also ordered share fires and drinks. The burgers came in a decent time.  As mentioned before, very simple.  The only problem with simple, it's not special.  There really was no Umami Moment.  It was as if you went to a buddies house for a BBQ and he made burgers.  No identity at all. The GF and I agreed that it was very blah. Next we ordered the pie. I got the Dutch Apple and she the Lemon Meringue.  My pie was ok, simple. The GF was stating that her Meringue had a tinny, metallic taste to it.  She didn't finish. What killed the whole experience more was the bill.  For what we got, the price tag was way out of the park.  It came out to $34 for the whole thing.  I've gotten more special food for less.  I've gotten more food in general for less.   I usually love the little people, but not this time.", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-08-28", "type": "review"}
