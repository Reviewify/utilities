The place is order at the counter with open kitchen and a few tables for eating in. The place is owned and operated by a Chinese couple. The menu offerings include the standard Chinese dishes plus Cantonese, Szechuan, Hunan, and Mandarin special dishes, mainly chicken, beef, and seafood and most dishes come with white rice. The prices are reasonable, most dishes are under $11. 20 Lunch Specials ($5.35-$6.60 Mon-Sat 11AM-3PM) served with pork fried rice and choice of soup, egg roll, or soda and 23 Special Combination Dinners served with pork fried rice and egg roll are offered. Health Food Selections with no salt, oil, or corn starch and served with steamed rice are also offered. I ordered the L8 Roast Pork Lo Mein ($5.35) with Pork Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup. The food and soup were cooked fresh to order in sizzling woks and pots. However, the food was prepared pretty simple and missing a few key ingredients found in the dishes. The lo mein was mostly soft noodles with the right amount of tender roast pork strips, but lacking in vegetables, very little cabbage. The fried rice was mostly firm golden rice with very few pieces of pork and diced onion, no egg or vegetables (ie peas/carrots/sprouts) added. The hot and sour soup had eggs, tofu, pork, and red pepper flakes, but no mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and wood ears in the soup. In general, the portions of hot food were generous for the price and tasted good, a bit on the salty side.", "business_id": "4Ep1aEi5o9wDThzL4dbWuw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-04", "type": "review"}
