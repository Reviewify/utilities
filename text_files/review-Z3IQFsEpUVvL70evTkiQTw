I called her as I was having issues with my iPhone and customer service directed me to this store as I bought the phone from them. She got on the phone with me, and instead of helping me, she got into an argument with me about how her employee was correct to give me misinformation and when I questioned how that was correct, she told me she wasn't going to sit there and argue semantics with me. You could tell she didn't give a sh*t when I voiced my displeasure at this and told her I'd have to rethink my options about my cell phone carrier in the future. She just said fine, as if she didn't care if Verizon lost a customer. GREAT rep for the company -___- Piece of advice for anyone thinking to buy an iPhone. GO TO THE APPLE STORE. Verizon only has a 14 day return/exchange policy and charges a $35 restocking fee. Apple has no restocking fee and a 30 day return/exchange policy. On top of that, if you have an issue with your iPhone, Verizon will just push you to Apple anyway. Save yourself the trouble and just go to Apple to begin with.", "business_id": "1lxPWNldqJTpcEM3a757CA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-01", "type": "review"}
