Really fresh fish, creative specialty rolls (go Korean-style sushi!!)  - and there's actually enough room to seat fairly large parties (~20 people), indoors or outdoors.  In fact, there's probably more indoor seating room than there is parking lot space - but Joshu-Ya is right at the intersection of Dwight and Telegraph so it's within walking distance from any of the shops on Telegraph and the vicinity.  I've actually found the service to be fairly quick and attentive - but that could be because one of my friends has the hook up (he works there part-time, we love you Isaac!).\n\n\nRecommended specialty rolls (in no particular order): Lucky Danny, Zoolander, Marilyn Monroe, Stanko, any of the tempura rolls,...and my friends had a special roll custom created called, \"The Ark.\"  Ask for \"The Ark\" roll.  So. Freakin'. Good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RDa29pAaWeZjA9MvAry7Gw"}
