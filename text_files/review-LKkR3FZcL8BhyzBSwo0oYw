That said, this is usually where I go when I'm looking to get Thai on campus. The staff is always extremely nice and the prices are not terrible. The food is not the best, but it's always edible (by college student standards, at least).\n\nThe main issue I have with their food is the overwhelming greasy-ness. I've never had a pad thai so oily and \"fried\" tasting. It's good, but it's heavy. And it's not what I'd consider \"pad thai\", rather some sort of Basil Thai original creation. The other noodle dishes are all the same way. The main dishes with rice are better, but still nothing memorable. Salads are absolutely not recommended, with greasy meat thrown on top of chopped iceberg lettuce. I have heard good things about the soup, but never tried it myself. \n\nWhat I have enjoyed is their curries. I can't remember which specific one I got, but it is the only thing I remember ordering there that I felt fit in with all the other Thai food I've eaten in my life.\n\nThe Urbana location is a nice place to sit and eat-in as well, as opposed to the one on Green Street which is far less classy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "w5Y_FiGPSlPemJVxAZZToQ"}
