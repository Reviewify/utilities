When you have a computer problem, you want  a solution FAST, because until it's fixed, everything grinds to a standstill.  I've relied on Bay State IT several times in the past three years. They always responded very quickly to my requests for help. They seem to have professionals strategically placed throughout the greater Boston area who can deploy to your home or office the same day, and often within a few hours. They are very knowledgable, and once they diagnose the problem, will take the time to explain it, what's involved with fixing it, how long it will take, and how much it will cost. Most importantly, they tell you ways to avoid losing data, protect your computer, best practices for back-up and maintenance tips. They have always been very friendly (and attractive!!) :-)  Aside from repairs, they also have helped me set up a network, load software, get all my hardware talking to eachother...stuff I would rather not have to figure out on my own. \nGreat Service is what I remember most, and it will keep me coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TRuQUtwPcQnW2isZoSCArw"}
