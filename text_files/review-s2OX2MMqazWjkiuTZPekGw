I was not disappointed. The first visit I had a drink with friends during their second week. The ambiance is very cool and trendy, its a first for us, and the menu selections were very tempting. I had red snapper and my friend had shrimp & grits. Both of us were VERY pleased. My friend had never dined in Harlem before and was very impressed. I love the blue lights, and the service was very good. Our waiter was extrememely professional and the wait time was not long. The owner stopped by our table and introduced himself and see how we enjoyed our meal which was a nice touch. Both times I went was during the week. I wish them the best. Harlem needs more places like this and I think it has great potential. Wait staff is excellent! Try their Chocolate Martini! Excellent and not too sweet!", "business_id": "YRfDdBgWS4T80oJfKmVThA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-31", "type": "review"}
