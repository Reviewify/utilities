I love the husband/wife owner team and their creations. From the food to the decor to their crazy hard working ethics. Abricott is a great restaurant. But I am less than crazy about the Old Town Pasasdena pricing scale. Croque-Madame is really good. The sauce has a heavy horseradish taste. It doesn't give you that sinus clearing sensation, but the taste is bold. Perfect sandwich. Love it. This came with shoestring fries which were more like potato threads. They are good but not as addictive as regular fries. For the heath conscious, this is great. Enough to satisfy but less filling. I am not totally sold on the pho. Maybe cuz I'm too married to the tradition stuff. Wife loved it. A bit lacking in depth for my taste. Or maybe just missing MSG. I dunno. Try this place out. You'll like it. A great variety of solid dishes.", "business_id": "R2-_hZIboGriSatS2kn7rw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-07", "type": "review"}
