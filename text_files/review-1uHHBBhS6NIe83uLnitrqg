It may look like a dive but that's because it is. C'mon man, you're looking for a place with the most legit blues in the city, do you expect a lounge adjacent to the Hilton? The neighborhood, honestly is kinda upcoming and a bit overpriced (at least when it comes to restaurants, I've heard living is still cheap). The place may look sketchy but it's surrounded by old factories converted into green living condos and apts. Check out the yelp reviews for local eateries and you'll find they are mostly $$$ and $$$$. Seriously, this is a yuppie neighborhood. We went there based on a recommendation from a musician we enjoyed watching at another venue (Nathan Nelson). The night we went to the Northside ended up with the same upright and 5-string bassist we saw with Nathan, Dave Roth, who is also also awesome. We saw Eddie Tigner take over on the keyboard. This tiny, 80-something year old man just takes over a room. Google him and you'll find he's an absolute legend. There are tons of funny bumper stickers and such behind the bar and the bartender even blew fire at one point later in the night. Everyone was so friendly and made sure we had a way of getting back to our hotel at the end. If you're in the area and you want some good live music (don't bother yourself with genre) then this place is NOT TO BE MISSED!", "business_id": "67C24XL76kejjs0BuwxJJw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-25", "type": "review"}
