For some reason, I really like bento boxes. Maybe it's food neatly organized or just the variety. Regardless of the reason, it brightens my day. \n\nOn my most recent visit, I tried the Bulgolgi Donburi, marinated beef on top of steamed rice with mushrooms and veggies. The spice seasoning on the beef  was mild but the combination of the different components really made it a good dish. Even though the Bulgolgi doesn't come in a bento box, i still received a bunch of different sides (kimchi, miso soup, salad). For under $10 it definitely is a good value for the quantity you get. I've also had some of their sushi in previous visits; nothing spectacular but it's a nice alternative to have for lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AKfHinPZ5vdPdHRzpvSWtw"}
