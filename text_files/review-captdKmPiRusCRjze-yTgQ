We were out apartment shopping for him and passed by it on accident so thought we would go back for dinner. We were pleased. The build your own burger idea was pretty cool and the options were great. The options that are $1.00 more are pretty much the best options...so I can see where they get you on that one because who doesn't want to add avocado or bacon to a burger? So....the price of a 1/3lb burger was $8.50 but with all the sides that I wanted on there it would have been closer to $12. But, no worries...still pretty good prices. \n\nMy burger was cooked well, which most people would say is overcooked and my boyfriends was cooked they way they cook all of the burgers. It was a little on the rare side just by looking at it but I guess that is how they do it....he enjoyed it.\n\nDress is definitely casual, and the service was great. The music made us laugh because it was more Top 100 and Hip Hop and when we looked around it was an older crowd. HAHA But, it was good for us.\n\nAlso.... finished the evening with a server recommended Peanut butter, chocolate and banana shake.5 stars for that! soooo Good!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MAW0cVbtqZEoXVESDkVDFQ"}
