Tough call, but you are going to get great wings and beer at either place!  I give both these places 5 stars.\n\nGo to the Ruck is you want a limited (but yummy) food selection, more beer selection, a fun bar atmosphere, and to cozy up next to some college co-eds later in the evening.\n\nGo to the Ale House if you want to sit down, be waited on, have more food selection, and not have the noise volume override your conversation. My friends and I will often randomly declare it \"Ale House Night\", and we all gather there.  It's laid back, not pretentious, the wait staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is conducive to conversation and catching up with each other.  Surprisingly, Wednesday night is Mexican night, and they have great Quesadillas!  In general, I recommend the wings (Regular Medium wings, and the Tequila Chipotle wings), sweet potato fries, and carrot cake!  \n\nThe Ale House has also started hosting the Front Parlor Storytelling series on the 2nd Tuesday of every month at 7:30.  This is an amazing night of storytelling, and definitely worth checking out.  I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner alone on that night - the place is packed, and you don't get a seat unless you show up before 6:45.
