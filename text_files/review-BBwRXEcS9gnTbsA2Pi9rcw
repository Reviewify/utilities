I ate with reckless abandon.  I cried a little when I left because they don't make fried chicken like that in Boston... I should have docked all my reviews 1 star for their bloody mary downfalls.  I drank 3 bloody mary's from 3 different  bars in the RTP and not one of them was good.  I thought Southerners know how to do it right?  I guess you have to go deeper south for that to be true.  However, at least Acme tried with 5-6 different types...that was impressive.  (here's a hint: interest.  Make them more interesting.  Add an Old Bay rim, throw in a pickled asparagus spear...I dunno....just make them better!) Notation: booze isn't served at brunch until NOON. I wish I lived in Carrboro so I could eat here all the time :(", "business_id": "7ZiKL8jps-9Xiu3LeVPGFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-11", "type": "review"}
