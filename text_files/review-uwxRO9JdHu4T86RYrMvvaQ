This chinkered log cabin is a relic of an older, tackier Atlanta and it delivers all the greasy and salty promise of a southern breakfast at half the cost. The food is cheap. Really. And the waitresses are sweet even if the owner's son is a mouthy, abusive arse to'em. One time, when Junior raged on while I was trying to work through a pile of biscuits and gravy, I got the Camper van Beethoven song \"Jack Ruby\" stuck in my head. Now whenever I go to Bobby and June's I hear \"He seemed like the kind of man/ who beats his horses/ or the dancers who work in a bar.\" Tip the waitresses well, please.", "business_id": "Ic2xakPYKgM_Uma5hnLnFg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-01", "type": "review"}
