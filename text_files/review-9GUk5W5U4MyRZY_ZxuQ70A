It is small, cozy and always packed with students who seem to camp out. If you can get a table it is the perfect place to meet up with a friend or sit down with a book.  The coffee is good and I highly recommend the Crema latte (Delicious honey and cinnamon concoction). I have only eaten there once long ago but their menu is extensive and very creative.", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-05", "type": "review"}
