It's by Georgia Tech, across from where the new 5 Seasons Brewery will be. \n\nYou can order some soups and sandwiches from the counter, then there are a few tables and the rest of the space is reserved for a relatively small amount of Italian dry goods, cheeses, pastas, prepared dishes, and wine. They have some fresh pastas from Via Elisa but also some of their own prepared foods. \n\nI ordered the minestrone soup and a soppressata, fontina, and arugula panini that was affordable, with above average bread and really hit the spot. \n\nI plan on going back to try more stuff, and possibly pickup some more cheeses. \n\nFull write-up here: http://www.eatitatlanta.com/2008/11/12/toscano-sons/", "type": "review", "business_id": "1kHV-hdQXDLeyRyrxn4p7g"}
