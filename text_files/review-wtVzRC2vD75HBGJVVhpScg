So many menu options, free sampling of anything and everything, and quick service for a place that's always so busy. I'm in Ann Arbor checking out U of M, and I had heard about this place from a friend. Suffice it to say that this is some of the best food I've had. Jon and Amy's Double Dip (corned beef, pastrami, the works) was big, was definitely worth finishing. Definite recommend.", "business_id": "fQ8c9S6jitKS5RT6S-ziGA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-19", "type": "review"}
