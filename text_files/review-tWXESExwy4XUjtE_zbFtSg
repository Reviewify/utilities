One night we came and there was almost an hour wait to be seated but with tons of empty tables. When we asked the host, he said it was because the kitchen was backed up. We turned around and left. We came the next day but even though we were seated promptly, we waited over 10 min before they asked us what we wanted to drink. Then again it took forever for the food to come. Maybe it was just a fluke because of presidents weekend, but this place is sloooow.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EqpBJpt5_JzF_MQjIvc6Gw"}
