We both got sangria ($8) and then one each of the flatbread, sandwich, salad, snacks and sweets (well 2 sweets) :)  The portions were very ample (we thought they might be skimpy given the happy hour special).  Would particularly recommend the arugula salad and the cranberry-turkey sandwich and the artichoke dip.  The dip itself was huge and definitely enough for 4 people.  Needless to say with only 2 people we took home much of the food.  A great, ample dinner out for $32, including drinks!", "business_id": "HrED44acwUngPkOWS0GUZg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-16", "type": "review"}
