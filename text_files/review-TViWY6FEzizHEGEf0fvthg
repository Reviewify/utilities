It's really crowded and loud, and I've seen lines out the door before when walking past which made me think it must be really excellent.  But, no.  The food just wasn't very good.  The first time we went I got an omelet, which I thought was kinda dry and not that interesting.  My friend had strawberry waffles which were just strawberries dumped on her waffle (I think she was expecting whipped cream and strawberry syrup).   Still, we decided to give it another go.  We both got pancakes, and we both thought they tasted like pancakes, nothing special.  She also got corned beef hash, but didn't like the consistency and left most of it on her plate.  Overall, a meh.", "business_id": "GHe641VggznYYFnD9RM8pQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-07", "type": "review"}
