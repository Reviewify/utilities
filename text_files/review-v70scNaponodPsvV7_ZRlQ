Can you even call it a pizza then?\". Yes. I'm serious. Enter Cafe 47. With everything I read on the menu, I was increasingly impressed. They label everything on the menu that is grown locally, so you can eat your meaty, cheese ridden pizza without feeling the guilt of knowing that the cheese came from 1,000 miles away. They also label the organic items.  AND THEN I saw the wine/beer menu. Yes. They also labeled the local craft beers and wines. I nearly died. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Not only were they in support of local farmers and small breweries, but the food was out of this world.  I saw that many of the customers were ordering takeout, so I know that must be where they do most of their business. That being said the interior decor was very intimate, and as I ate in I would recommend that. The staff was friendly and service was prompt.", "business_id": "06eY-W4sjDQjhVDjnhJi4Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-11", "type": "review"}
