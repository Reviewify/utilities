I had the Prime Rib (done medium rare of course) and it was deeeeeeelicious. Yay for meals paid for by my family. \n\nI also got a shrimp cocktail, it was alright. The cocktail sauce was average but I think they put too much vegetables in it.\n\nMy mom and sister in law got the salad bar, which looked alright. My dad had some kind of fish, it was pretty good too. \n\nService was great, the place was really home-y. I only went to the restaurant and not the inn tho, I'm sure it was nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Gx2873IIvAYb9eRvXKJoYg"}
