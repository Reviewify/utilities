It's cheap and you get a HUGE portion (if you want to) so it's a good value. However, that's where quality suffers. Let's be honest: it's frozen meat. It's not that good. However, once you cover it up with noodles and veggies and spicy sauce it tastes ok. It's very salty which is annoying, but hey, it covers up the meat. Overall, good value, lacking quality/flavor. Come here if you're hungry, not to get an authentic mongolian BBQ experience", "type": "review", "business_id": "T42uQiJVIUqTTWMmkQtDiQ"}
