They have an upstairs for dine-in and downstairs for takeout. If you go there for lunch, its significantly cheaper than dinner. Samosas are only $2 and they're huge. Grab one or two and a few chutneys and you're good to go.", "business_id": "g6NXfYp1ZeJjUQrqne8-Ig", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-23", "type": "review"}
