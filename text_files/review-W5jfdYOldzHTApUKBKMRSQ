They make the pizza from scratch. ALL of it. So that means after your order, they make crust, put on the toppings, and bake it in this wood oven. I think baking probably takes the longest...up to 45 minutes. However, the pizza is so good. I would probably have given this place 3.5 stars. Also, it seems that their employees are as mellow as the mushroom on their sign, if you know what I mean. Their bathrooms are really nice though. They get brownie points for that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Apjfj4kkALF86mPlD9gR_Q"}
