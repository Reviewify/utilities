Sad because for so long it had been on our list of places to try in Troy, a place that everyone said we simply must try - and it didn't live up to my expectations. I don't really have any complaints about the food. It's flavourful, hearty Italian fare. The salads were great, and the bread was delicious (though I should have read Ticia's review more carefully - I didn't realize you had to special request oil, so we just got butter). I had an eggplant parm that was lovely but could have held off on the cheese, and my husband had a seafood dish that was loaded very generously with scallops. Here comes the '.... but.' When we walked in to the somewhat empty room without a reservation, I was surprised at the instantly frosty reaction from the hostess. Like lullabylove x, we got shafted in this table by the kitchen, where there was huge amounts of traffic from the staff.  I felt uncomfortable the whole night as it was difficult to relax with someone brushing by every five seconds. It sucked. I also had the distinct impression if I was thirty years older I would have been treated better. A place has to be really special for me to ignore such bad service.", "business_id": "_21B4W3qjnl8lcxDYJE3kw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-07-20", "type": "review"}
