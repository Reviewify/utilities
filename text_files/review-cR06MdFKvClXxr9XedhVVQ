I showed up for dinner with several friends only to find that the restaurant was \"closed for the holidays from 12/24 to 1/02\".  Ok, that's fine, I understand a holiday closing.  The only problem was, I showed up on 1/03 and they were closed.  Staying closed another day would be fine, just change your sign.  I was extremely disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "F_ofTZiczPkYZ93JAE3RRQ"}
