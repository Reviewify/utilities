The old Earl's had charm, with the attic level with air hockey, and the impossibly crowded bar area downstairs. Last night my date and I stepped in on a whim, our attention first drawn to the place by a gaggle of young harlots in cleavage inducing striped tops and orange skin. Sweet. My expectations were low, and they were met. The charm of the old place is gone. The bar could theoretically handle traffic better than the old joint, but the overwhelming horde made for lengthy backups. Never mind that the girl in front of me in line ordered 2 Slammers, 2 Iced Teas, one 3 Wise Men, and a few other assorted shots. I came in expecting that on a Thursday night there'd be a 50-60% ratio of people actually over 21, and I have to admit that it was probably closer to 80%. Plenty of little tarts with big old tities hanging out, plenty of dudes saying \"dude\" but everyone was pretty chatty and I wound up even meeting some somewhat respectable if not incredibly bright pharmacy students that were 28 and thereabouts. We never got a pool table but the darts were open. The air hockey is gone. The place was fine for what it is.", "business_id": "mtpoFcw4x8W0C9Qhs_PYfw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-05-18", "type": "review"}
