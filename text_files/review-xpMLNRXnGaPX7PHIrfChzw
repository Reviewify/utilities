Anything they were unsure about, they googled, including the alcohol for my cocktails.\n\nEverything I ordered was better than I could have imagined. The roasted cod and the olive oil pistachio ice cream were out of this world.\n\nI can't say enough good things about the food AND the staff! Very gluten free friendly!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rP90TP7gOMzBFTrKWEEsOw"}
