Parking isn't too bad so don't get freaked out by the whole \"street parking\" thing. The decor is super fun and definitely Mexican! Lots of sombreros and beer signs along with coordinated lighting and wood finishes. We were seated in an acceptable amount of time at a small table in the back. For this dinner date, being seated away from people was nice but not usually something I am totally psyched for. I kinda felt like I was at the reject table. There seemed to be a birthday party going on by the bar, which is nice to know for the next time I have a friend's birthday coming up. We ordered the queso dip which was yummy! It had a nice kick to it. For my first, and only, drink I ordered a mango margarita. As many other yelpers have said, BEWARE of the drinks. They are very strong! But good ;) I ordered black bean chimichungas (spelling?) and my friend ordered baja fish tacos. The food was to die for. I kept wanting to eat more but I was so full after eating half. My dish was served with guacamole and olives on top and rice. The guacamole really helped to cut all of the flavors going on because sometimes too many flavors can be overwhelming. Service was good. Nothing to complain about, nothing to rave about. The only thing I was wish done differently was for the server to time things a little better so that our entrees did not come out when we were still eating our appetizer. That's just a small pet peeve of mine when the appetizer is not cleared when dinner comes out. We almost had no room on our little round table.", "business_id": "MGOt6JSu0NPI-DKhWRTTeA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-18", "type": "review"}
