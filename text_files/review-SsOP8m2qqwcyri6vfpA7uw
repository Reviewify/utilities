Amongst the many Indian restaurants in the city, New Delhi has to be by far the best when it comes to price, quality and quantity.  Not only is the buffet about $10 per person, but show your student ID and you get 10% off.  As cheap as it sounds, we've never ordered off of the menu because everything on the buffet's awesome. The service is top notch - it's like being at a 5-star restaurant in the city.  If you're done with your plate, it's gone in a minute and if you need a refill, it magically appears.  Perfect. I strongly suggest that anyone who hasn't tried Indian food before should stop here first, close your eyes, and try it all.  We brought my dad there a few months ago and he literally tried it all and loved it. Keep up the good work New Delhi.", "business_id": "YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-05", "type": "review"}
