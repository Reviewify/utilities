The place is pretty mellow on most nights, but sometimes there's quite the crowd. (And that's not necessarily a bad thing!) Great atmosphere. Great lighting. Descent music. The bar staff is always polite and always seem to be having a good time. This totally became my favorite bar in Austin... Glad I stumbled into it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TRMSNc6MM_YRzT1YnaEmWA"}
