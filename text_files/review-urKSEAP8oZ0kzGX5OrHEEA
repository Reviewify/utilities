We should have though because I fell in love with this cute little cafe. When we walked in, we weren't sure if we should sit down (judging by the appearance of the place-very rustic and spartan) but then we decided to check it out anyway since everyone around us seemed to be having a great time and enjoying the food/atmosphere. I had the black bean salad which was served with corn chips. It was great, very flavorful although it could do without the onion, just tasted weird with the avocado and black beans. I also had the chocolate mousse, which was fabulous too. My only caveat was  that there was way too much alcohol/rum tasting stuff in it especially when I got towards the end of that bowl.  Our server was great, charming and a great conversationalist while leaving the table for enough time to do the same for other patrons. Although like someone else mentioned, the server did disappear right after he left our food on the table and we didn't see him after that until we asked for the check which was just as well as my friend and I were engrossed in our own little conversation. This is great cafe for people watching by the way and I bet it's fun to sit outside in the summer. I can't wait to go back!", "business_id": "22o_VdMfKA1jjemWwbeujg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-18", "type": "review"}
