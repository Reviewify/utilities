The menu has a lot to choose from, though items can be a bit pricey. The best deal has to be the lunch special. There are four choices for the $7.95 lunch special. Since we were a group of three, we chose three out of the four possible specials and would share our meals with each other. One friend ordered chow mein with miso soup, salad, and honey chicken, my other friend ordered garlic chicken with salad, gyoza, and jasmine rice, and I ordered the green curry with salad, an egg roll, and jasmine rice. Everything came out fairly quick and in an orderly manner. I tried mine first... the curry, unfortunately, was on the watery side, but the vegetables were done well and the salad and egg roll were very tasty. My friends' food definitely took the cake... the garlic chicken was savory and the chow mein had a unique flavor but was still very good!  We decided to finish off the meal with some green tea ice cream. It wasn't out of the ordinary, but the presentation was well-done. Trio House is nothing extraordinary, but for college kids who have been deprived of asian food for a couple of weeks... this stuff hits the spot!", "business_id": "1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-26", "type": "review"}
