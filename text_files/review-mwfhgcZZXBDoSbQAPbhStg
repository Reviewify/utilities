I quickly realized that contemporary is definitely preferred over historical art. However...I'm not sure if I totally love it. Some of it is very cool while other parts are plain bizarre.  This museum is comprised of 2 floors. The first one is just a big room, it has a loft type feel to it with bigger physical pieces while the lower level is mainly just pictures.  This exhibit featured engines, a car shell, skulls, bones, neon lights, and a moon man pinned to the wall. I took the meaning to be the going to the moon at all costs.  Overall it was pretty interesting, but the best thing was the palm tree in the back.  Also this place is FREE.", "business_id": "kaJbKJmdVYuzYyZeWr3YtA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-17", "type": "review"}
