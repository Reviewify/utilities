It seems to be hemorrhaging money. But that's besides the point. Intended to be a cool, fun space for lesbians and their friends, Shine just completely dropped the ball. Great vision; horrible execution. Drinks are ridiculously over-priced (and that's assuming you can even get one, before you walk away out of utter frustration). Dance floor is small and awkward, and there's a minimal amount of seating available. Music is reliably vomit-inducing. Saturday nights are hit-or-miss: either you're the only person there, or the place is so jam packed with the 35+ crowd that you just feel like a pre-pubescent. Expect a cover charge. Annoying to get to from the Kendall T-stop.", "business_id": "ElpPPmebeOHLxEmp5XRhmQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-01-13", "type": "review"}
