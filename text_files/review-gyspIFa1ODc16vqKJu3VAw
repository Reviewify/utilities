I say best cuz I still think all of these restaurants have no serious competition.  Again I could have a bias in regards to Chinese food but I think San Jose beats all these places hands down.  Food quality was alright.  Standard and kinda uninspired.  They did carry \"yo teow\" (sp?) and \"do jian\" so that kinda made my day but otherwise... if anyone asks me of what I think of Chinese in Princeton, I'd say, save yourself and go to New York.  Pricey too... yech...\n\nThe first time I came here, we ended up tipping around 10% cuz the service was horrendous.  We waited forever for them to take our order and gave us some attitude while we were still deciding.  What really set me off though was the fact that after this, the waitress had the nerve to look at the check and demand more right in front of us.  WTF?  I was leaning towards a higher tip prior to this as my friends are a little conservative on tips in general... but once she pulled this crap, that sealed the deal.  In fact, thinking of the ordeal's pisses me off so much that instead of giving em 3 stars as I had originally planned, imma give them 2.\n\nPros: Best Chinese food in Princeton\nCons: Service?  Taste?  Where's the competition?\nVerdict: I might come here with a friend, but only if they want to go", "type": "review", "business_id": "_Q7Q04xMtletor5BwDf2xg"}
