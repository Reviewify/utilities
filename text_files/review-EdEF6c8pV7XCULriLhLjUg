The (what I am assuming) owner's wife came and talked to us, told us about her family, talked about how lovely my girlfriend's eyes are, etc. She was genuinely fantastic. Moving on....\n\nWe ordered the twenty dollar \"Everything Vegetarian,\" and it was a little greasy. I wanted to rave about it. I wanted to love it, but saying I did would be disingenuous. Basically, this meal was literally everything on the menu that didn't contain meat.\n\nThe good: Excellent falafel, a scrumptious salad that tasted like nothing I have ever had, and really great pita bread.\n\nThe meh: I thought both the hummus and the babaganoush were a little greasy. Excellent consistency and flavor, but an unnecessary pool of oil on the top.\n\nThe bad: Dolmas left something to be desired. Once again, very greasy. And a little slimy. Like runny garlic peanut butter wrapped in a leaf. Kind of coated the mouth with an oil based film. Not good. And the lentil soup (something I normally love) had a reflective grease sheen on the top, and looked as if it wouldn't be out of place washing up on a gulf shore.\n\nOnce again, I cant stress enough how amazingly great the owners were. Hilarious, genuine, and very kind. The value was amazing, and we were both very full when we left. I would certainly go back now that I have an idea of what to order. Stick with the falafel, stay away from the awful. Get it?\n\nTalk to the employees. They are very sweet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yqQ6Umb2Rc9mJcsgxswt-A"}
