I can't tell one sloppy pile of goo from the other sloppy pile of goo. Not even from a difference of colors......that's pretty scary. \n\nThe utensils and plates that they offer are used and look really dirty and cold. I was already afraid of eating what I ordered because it was literally puke color and puke consistency, but it was also in a dirty bowl. What an awesome combination. \n\nSo, verdict: Been there, done that, tried it...not going back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zxgq_w9H65cy-V_GQDK5qg"}
