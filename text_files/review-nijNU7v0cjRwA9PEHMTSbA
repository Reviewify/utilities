The food tastes like what vegan food sounds like. I can't tell one sloppy pile of goo from the other sloppy pile of goo. Not even from a difference of colors......that's pretty scary.  The utensils and plates that they offer are used and look really dirty and cold. I was already afraid of eating what I ordered because it was literally puke color and puke consistency, but it was also in a dirty bowl. What an awesome combination.  So, verdict: Been there, done that, tried it...not going back!", "business_id": "zxgq_w9H65cy-V_GQDK5qg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-05", "type": "review"}
