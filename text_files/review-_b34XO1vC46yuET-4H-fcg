Burdick's has the *BEST* Macaroons I have had in the U.S. My bf bought me a bag to eat in the car. However, after one delicate bite in the cafe (fitting in perfectly with the nonchalant Harvard crowd), we morphed into crazy, ravenous werewolves and gobbled the entire bag. We almost gobbled the bag, too. YUM! This entire process happened one more time and we left, feeling slightly guilty and very fulfilled. So many flavors and light, fluffy tastes. They melt in your mouth like angelic little clouds. I'm sorry, I can't even comment on the hot chocolate or teas we ordered because it would seem wrong not to dedicate this entire review to The Macaroons.", "business_id": "gctbL0lDIYIHM6yDn99V-g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-03-19", "type": "review"}
