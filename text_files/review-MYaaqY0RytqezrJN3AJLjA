Reading the reviews (highlights and the low-lights; 'pizza get soggy if not eaten immediately', 'eating in the kitchen is loud and bustling'  , 'there' nowhere to put my SUV or my two rug-rats.' and so on...) my in-and-out lunch experience where all of us left the kids at home and passed on the cool metallic Coke bottles for sparkling spring water was pretty excellent.  I don't remember the name of the pizza we ordered (it had mushrooms and artichoke hearts, that I do remember), but it was completely excellent. Not too much garlic, not too little good-quality tomatoeyness, and, though others may disagree, the char, for me, is what tells you it's from a high-temperature brick oven, and not an industrial pass-through like your typical pizza joint.  We jockeyed for a table (and, to be honest, some of my dining partners would have preferred one), but ended up standing at one of the high-tops in the back. Great for lunch. Had I anticipated a leisurely sit-down dinner, Iwould have been disappointed, but knowing what the space is like, I kind of feel like that's not what Antico is selling here.  This is no white-checkered tablecloth-linger around the cappuccino type of place.This is a raucous Italian immersion course full of fire and blaring arias that's all dodging elbows and jostling for position with your stranger-table mates. It's lightening-quick and messy and fun, and really, really tasty. Highly recommended.", "business_id": "CxQ1m2iY4wQpXC64tSfWgQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}
