First off the interior is beautifully designed and has a welcoming layout. The atmosphere was definitely buzzing, but we had no problem hearing our own conversations at seating for 8. The Food here is wonderful. Full of flavor and in combinations that are very unique using ingredients both familiar and unfamiliar that kept everyone at the table saying the same thing after tasting \"Ooh, that was good, what was that?\" with responses of \"I have no idea but pass it over here\" or \"Mmmmm\". In any case, the menu is very vegetarian friendly though there is enough to satisfy the average carnivore as well. With our party of 8 we managed to widely sample the menu, including Halibut tartare, Compressed strawberries, Baby Artichoke Salad, Spring Vegetable Salad, Spring vegetable broth, Vegan \"charcuterie\", Spicy tomato Pizza, Barbecued young chicken, Prather Ranch burger, Braised Lamb Shoulder. EVERYTHING was good according to all diners, well sourced, executed and most important, TASTY. Favorites for me was definitely the BBQ Chicken (juicy and fall of the bone tender), Vegan charcuterie (amazing variety, unexpected, and very flavorful), and the Spicy tomato Pizza (light, wonderfully crispy crust, and had a good spicy bite). Oh, and I had the best Ginger Beer I've ever had. Light, refreshing and with a real spicy ginger kick like i've never had anywhere else before. Excellent. Service was great, the hostess was very accommodating to our group despite last minute changes to our party. Our server explained everything very well and kept all of our glasses refilled. Food came out promptly and for the price I thought everything was a great value. Gather is definitely a place to return to.", "business_id": "BiZAzf2SAFCE0gJrX-PGFw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-03", "type": "review"}
