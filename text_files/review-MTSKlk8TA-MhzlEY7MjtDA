We decided to go here because we walked by while going to the Farmer's Market and noticed that there was a lot of ppl in there so we figured it would be good.   The setting there is very simple.  They have pictures and a big board illustrating what is on their menu and you can actually order based on what # you select.  The most expensive item on there is $8.50 and they only have ONE w/that price.  The quantity is pretty big and the food is pretty good.  We had the tempura noodles (#3) and the chicken combo (#11). You have to bus your own table and get your own utensil and water, but I think for the inexpensive price its worth it.  I believe that's how they reduce the cost of their entrees is by reducing their overhead/labor cost.  They now have a punch card, where if you order 12 entrees the next one is free.  I think this is a very clever way to ensure that you have return customers.   They have delivery w/a min of $25.  Overall, the quantity, price and food is good, especially if you are on a budget and looking to get very full.", "business_id": "_rlU6AQD8jJJb7iCiHrRdg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-06", "type": "review"}
