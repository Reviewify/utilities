I used to live above Sharks (the costume/vintage store next to Peet's). So down the stairs, out the gates, walk by one store, and there it was Peet's. Living so close to Peet's had it's benefits; I use to go quite a bit and the baristas were very Berkeley and nice. It definitely contributed to my caffeine intake for the day. The seating space inside is decent and it plays classical music, which I love. There's also seating outside, but sometimes it's being occupied by young hooligans or homeless people (no worries this is normal for Berkeley standards). The only negative thing was that it closed too early; can't go down for late night coffee! (It would have been a 5 star if it opened later, so really, it's more like 4.5 star). :o)", "business_id": "Ojj7Eb6gxtZ_X5g2oQuoOg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-06", "type": "review"}
