UPDATED: I came here on a Friday after work and tried the Bier Grand Sampling with 5 5oz samples of beer. I think I had Erdinger Dunkle, Erdinger Urweisse, Duvel, Delirium and the Krusovice. So nice I had to try it twice. I came back Sunday afternoon and had the Bier Grand Sampling again had the Jenlain, Krusovice, Deirium, Erdinger Urweisse and the Erdinger Dunkle. I think the Dunkle is slowly but surely becoming my favorite. It was getting ate so my friend and I decided to get something to eat, I had the Krainerwurst sausage and it was to die for. I love spicy food and mustard, the absolute best. I ordered the pretzels thinking I would get sourdough pretzel bits but they were 2 full freshly made pretzels! Communal tables are a still a bit weird for me, you're either forced into someones creepy conversation or you have people budding into yours, like this man did to my friend and I. Other than that, Bier is definitely becoming one of my favorite places to hang in Harlem.", "business_id": "Fk495HaokZDrGkAG8s_dlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-06", "type": "review"}
