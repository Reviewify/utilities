It's in a shopping center that is definitely crowded and it might take a few minutes to get a spot, but it's not like trying to drive up and down streets for street parking.\n\nSecond, the staff was extremely friendly and they were not over chatty like I saw in other reviews.  Just right, always smiling and just super helpful and very patient!! I also didn't find the shop crowded...but I was also there around lunchtime, so maybe the dessert crowd hadn't hit yet:)\n\nThird, and most important...the CUPCAKES!!! They were as amazing as I remembered!!! I had the Banana, Lemon, and Irish Chocolate (shared of course, I didn't eat 3 alone:)) I LOVED them all!!!!  As far as the price, I've been on a \"mission\" to test cupcake stores when I travel and the price is very worth it and reasonable.  I have had other cupcakes that were same price or less than $0.50 less than Sprinkles and they didn't even compare quality wise.  I'd compare this to saying \"you can get designer Seven for All Mankind jeans for $200 or you can have the cheaper Old Navy ones for $175...which would YOU chose??\".  If the \"designer\" cupcakes are very little more (plus they taste WAY better), then why NOT go with them?!?!  And as someone said earlier, even if they have gotten smaller in size, I would still pay for them!  \n\nHope they get one in my town soon (or maybe my figure will thank me if they don't:)) A million thumbs up to these gals at Sprinkles in La Jolla!", "type": "review", "business_id": "roEQNfyPi3jRv3WFFr-f_g"}
