They have a little blurb on there that says \"Voted Best Customer Service of 2008\".  Check it out.  I does NOT say who did this voting.  Fer real.  It has no indication of in what Bizarro World poll this took place.  Typical Campus and Central.  \"Let's make something up and see how many people believe it.\" And if you don't believe me, check out the Better Business Bureau which indicates that Campus and Central has been told to remove this statement because it violates the BBB's Truthful Advertising code.   Classy, NIck, really classy.", "business_id": "J4U35rKMJu91Y2R9orntIg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-03-02", "type": "review"}
