I went here to get a mani pedi since the sign outside advertises that you can get them both done for $15, which might quite possibly be the cheapest anywhere in LA. The pedicure was so bad I decided to skip the manicure. Why waste $7 more dollars? The lady said she's been there for 19 years, so I was expecting good work. She used dish soap as a foot soak and I doubt the tools were sanitized. I almost got up and walked out when she put the polish on my nails with no base coat at all and the paint job was sloppy. Instead of putting the lotion on my feet, she put it on my legs....I was so confused!!! Just to make things worse, she would be quite about her daughters relationship problems. Never again!", "business_id": "4c_37VOogYjnY2R_GIU4xw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-06-23", "type": "review"}
