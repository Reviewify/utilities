The last place you want to do your laundry is at a dirty laundromat!!! If you don't want to look like a newb (that was totally me), just follow my directions: 1. Walk all the way in & next to the counter, there's a machine where you can buy a rechargeable card. This will cost you $3 and you need to put in dollars. NO $5's, $10's 2. Once you get your card, you can charge however much you want! This time, you may use $5 or $10 bills. 3. The washer's pretty easy to use--follow the direction. They have small, medium, large & extra large size machines for $2.50, $3.50, $5.50 and & $7. 4. The dryer's a bit more complicated. For every 8 minutes, it's $0.35. So if you want to use it for 32 minutes, then you put your card in, the machine will show how much is left on your card & you press a button that says 8 (8 for 8 min & you gotta either press the cold, warm, or hot). Then you swipe your card again, this will now increase the minutes to 16 & so on. If you're not sure how many minutes you need, then just try 8-16 min & put in more money as you go. You can also open the machine while it's running if you need to take something out or if you want to check. There is an area where you can fold your laundry, but it's not that big, so I def wouldn't do that especially if the place was crowded.", "business_id": "ncSgY1qZEM7LkkytY6Cehg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-06", "type": "review"}
