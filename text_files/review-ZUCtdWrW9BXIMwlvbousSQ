I walked out of there with a giant $8 bouncy ball with blue and purple dust inside and a magic light ball that lights up when you bounce it (uber trippy).  My girlfriend got some stickers of space dogs and some stationary for a friend's birthday.  \n\nBasically, this is the kind of place that you don't plan on buying things at but can't really help yourself if you're at all into kitsch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D_ZKufq8TzvOVo4CLrA00w"}
