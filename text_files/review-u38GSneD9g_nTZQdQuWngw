So obviously I HAD to check it out once I was older, hehe.\n\nWhile I wish I could have been around when it was in its heyday, I'm perfectly satisfied with how it is today. Telegraph Ave. is one of my favorite places to go to. For the most part, I walk around, browsing shops before and after going to Zebra (because whenever I'm on Telegraph, I'm going for my piercings initially) and just enjoying the street.\n\nTelegraph Ave. is worth a visit at least once if not more often.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6kYBC9JIMPueGFI5Da98-w"}
