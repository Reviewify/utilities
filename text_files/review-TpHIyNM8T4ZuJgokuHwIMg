I was really excited, but the experience was SO blah. The wine was really poor quality. For the price, I wasn't expecting really expensive foreign wine, but literally all of it was California or Washington wine and most was Clos du Bois, Gallo, and even Charles Shaw. They had a few different varieties, but I was really really disappointed. When selection is poor, service can be redeeming. THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL. The woman who worked there looked like the only employee there... and her boyfriend was hanging around, so she was distracted. When we asked for some water, she looked at us like we were crazy. She said that they didn't have water (WHO DOESN'T HAVE WATER?) and when we asked again and said we'd settle for tap, she huffed and got us a tiny glass that had about a quarter of a cup of water in it. It was pathetic. She left the wine area so we had to go to the bathroom to re-fill our cups. The woman acted like it was her mission to get us out of there. We might have bought full glasses or come back again if we'd had a good experience but this woman was literally trying to make us leave. Finally, we realized that we hadn't gotten any kind of discount from our groupon. Although it said we'd gotten a 50% discount on our $20 groupon, prices were REGULARLY $5/flight... so wine styles lied to us. I will NEVER go back to Wine Styles. The service was pathetic, the wine was terrible, and the groupon gave us a raw deal.", "business_id": "LrDOKA2n0tyzCEE_aSXEqw", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-30", "type": "review"}
