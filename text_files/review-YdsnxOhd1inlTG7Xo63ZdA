It was somewhat difficult to find but worth it. Cacti are somewhat ugly looking plants but very interesting. Their prickly nature lends them that unique shape. It's an awesome place to just wander around. It took me back to my travels to NM ABQ. There are giant ones that dwarfed moi. Not that a simple tomato plant won't be able to do :) But this one even more. Some cacti are more pleasing to the eye than the rest. But it is truly a unique place to go and visit. It's free and peaceful. When I was here I saw a person and that was it. It was isolated enough that it offers you serenity that is a good match while you walk around undisturbed. Although it's not fenced in I can see taking kids here for a show and tell.It's pretty cool really.", "business_id": "7kDmnprC9ZK-KiMw0SV5yQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-13", "type": "review"}
