A lot has changed with the menu over the past five years but the main things have not - (a) Great Burgers (b) Great Beer Selection (c) Great atmosphere.\n\nI ordered the English Burger ($10.95 - cheddar, bacon, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun and your choice of fries or salad) which I had years ago. Back then it came on an English Muffin with a fried egg, now a days it comes on a toasted bun with no egg, but you can still have the English Muffin by request.\n\nThe burger was still amazing. The patty juicey and cooked to perfection and the bun perfectly complimented the meat and toppings.\n\nThe beer selection offers a great variety of local and New England microbrews. The atmosphere is filled with energy and youth (thanks Columbia).\n\nWhile the 125th Street location may seem out of the way for some, I assure you that you will not only enjoy a great burger at Toast, but also a great time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VAkdznBlCPQ7KFvm-Kma0g"}
