Stayed here for a wedding that was in the area. Location is great and very convenient. It's not a 5-star experience, but you don't come to Palo Alto for that. This Sheraton does the job and the staff is friendly and helpful. Parking is $10 a night and is very easy, so I wouldn't valet unless you want to burn money. Food was surprisingly good. Bed and pillows were comfy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IjEH1nDo-XGvS7afud_q0Q"}
