I had a dish from their \"Specials Menu\" It was a steak with peppercorns and a awesome sauce, roasted potatoes, and vegetables. My Friend had another dish from their \"Special Menu\" It was a sole fish with a Delicious sauce. As an appetizer we had the spinach empanadas and the baby spinach salad. For dessert we had the Dulce de Leche Crepes. I'm not a fan of Dulce de Leche, but these were pretty Yummy. Highly recommended.", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-25", "type": "review"}
