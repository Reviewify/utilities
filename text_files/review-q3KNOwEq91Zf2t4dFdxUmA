Had the beef steak teriyaki and mix tempura. The lunch special includes white rice, miso soup, and salad. Everything came out to $8. The tempura batter used was was great. The service was good. I went during lunch time and it was a bit busy. For the people who are on a strict lunch schedule, you will be in and out of the place in 30-40 minutes. You can also call in and order for pick up. If you are looking for good Japanese food at wallet friendly prices, go to Zono Sushi for the lunch specials.
