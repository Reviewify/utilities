My husband and I went here months ago and I keep meaning to write a review.  We both got the King Crab dinners, which were spectacular!  $65/person and the quality of the food was magnificent.  We had a fantastic bottle of vino as well.  The service was impeccable.  Always anticipating our needs, and exceeding our expectations.  We live close by and will be going again and again.  Thank you!", "business_id": "mjJH2IVATkFqWdleRc3dmg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-12", "type": "review"}
