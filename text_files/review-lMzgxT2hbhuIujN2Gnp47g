I came to the cashier, asked for a sample, they have plain, green tea, & pomegranate. I only tried the plain & green tea. If you love green tea taste, I suggest it here!! The plain was tangy & creamy, It's not exactly like PinkBerry, It's more like yogurt bar in SF, It's Okay. But i love the green tea taste!! To open in such a busy area like this, they should've prepared the fruit in advance. When I came in, the girl still peeling the kiwis in front of me. & then the server asked what kind of topping i'd like, and I said mango & they didn't have it. So it was pretty limited when I have to choose the topping. But overall it was good. I give a 3* for right now (fr green tea!). If they turn out to be better in the future, i will give more of course. Oh don't forget, it's 10% discount for students. You have to ask them for a discount, or you could give to them as tips ;p", "business_id": "UcYOqUelwmNsftrYTQdh0g", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-10-30", "type": "review"}
