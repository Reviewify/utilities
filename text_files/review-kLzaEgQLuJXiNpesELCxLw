I'm not exactly a veteran of such establishments (meaning I haven't scoured the universe to find the perfect one) but I'm impressed with the efficiency, prices and selection at InStyle. Compared to other places, the prices truly are reasonable. Compared to other salons, the colors they provide really are exceptional. (I know some people don't think they have enough OPI... try Essie for ONCE in your life! OPI isn't the end-all-be-all of nail polish!) Yes, it is frustrating when there is gossip in a language you don't understand, but hey. They scrubbing your feet. How would you feel in that position? I think they deserve some slack! It's also in a lovely location, so you can stroll down Westwood Blvd while your nails dry to the finish (they do have nail dryers - with computers to go on, no less!) but we all know they're still a bit vulnerable even after that.  I have no idea why anybody gives two shits about the pink. It's a nail salon, not a home design studio.", "business_id": "zIKNSkOpNOXeXsXIlZ8Onw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-06", "type": "review"}
