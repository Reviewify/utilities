(i know some people don't think they have enough opi... try essie for once in your life! opi isn't the end-all-be-all of nail polish!) yes, it is frustrating when there is gossip in a language you don't understand, but hey. they scrubbing your feet. how would you feel in that position? i think they deserve some slack! it's also in a lovely location, so you can stroll down westwood blvd while your nails dry to the finish (they do have nail dryers - with computers to go on, no less!) but we all know they're still a bit vulnerable even after that. i have no idea why anybody gives two shits about the pink. it's a nail salon, not a home design studio.", "business_id": "zIKNSkOpNOXeXsXIlZ8Onw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-06", "type": "review"}
