Yes, really. Today I ate a #1 with everything. When I was 16, I lived on grilled cheese Hoagies (they weren't yet on the menu, but I ate one every sunday after church - yes, church). When I stopped being vegetarian one night at midnight, I ate a whole roast beef hoagie by the fountain with my skater buddies. In college, I got into the weird realm of cheesesteaks, and all the crazy heart stopping variants that fellow Cloister Inn folks invented. Since then, every visit home, reunions, holidays, involves several haven visits. I'm still a huge fan of a #1 with everything - except mayo. I won't turn down bites of a hot pastrami or a bacon cheesteak, but my 6 foot husband is more likely to burn that off.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5G0Vy0N4H6c4eIGxb1JPSQ"}
