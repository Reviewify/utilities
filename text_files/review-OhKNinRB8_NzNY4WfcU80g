I used to eat here every Sunday, and order some eggs. Nothing great, nothing terrible, it was just, well, eggs. Then I made the mistake of coming here for dinner. I ordered a tuna melt. It wasn't that good. A few hours later, around midnight, I woke up with a horrible feeling in my stomach. I fell asleep for a few minutes, than I woke up and uber-barfed all over my bed. It was pink, the same color as the tuna melt I had eaten a few hours before. Carousel had given me food poisoning. Besides that, the food is mediocre at best, the decor is non-existent, and the music is terrible. Vile place. DO NOT WANT.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fjGpK3l90w_NX3dICkKj4Q"}
