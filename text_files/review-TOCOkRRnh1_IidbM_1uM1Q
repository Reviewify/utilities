I like that you can walk in there and buy some things that will be expiring the next day for a huge discount.  They don't add preservatives, which is a big bonus and their juices are not limited to Orange and Mango.   I like that you check it out yourself and I love that they have recycling bins in the front where you can recycle bottles, grocery bags, etc.  The employees are so friendly and they put little testers of cookies out every day.  I would recommend this to single people who would like to make meals simpler or to small families.  It's hard to cook for just two people, but their meals are just the right size. I hope this has been helpful!", "business_id": "aKzoUZv2iND_AFv62cuMYw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-08", "type": "review"}
