I would not go to Patsy's again even if they paid me. 1) I wanted some simple embroidery on a jacket. They refused to complete the order after I told them I was dissatisfied by their numerous delays. 2) I placed my order on Monday, and Raul said it would be done Friday. On Friday, they told me to come back Tuesday. On Tuesday, they told me to come back Thursday. On Thursday, they told me to come back Monday. On Monday, they told me to come back Tuesday. On Tuesday, they made me stand and watch them sew my order...which only took 15 min, so I don't see why they procrastinated so ridiculously inappropriately. I had to leave and didn't get my order until today, after I already missed my friend's birthday. I was very polite and understanding throughout, even when they called and woke me up in the morning to tell me they couldn't spare 15 minutes for my order but could give me a 10-minute long call filled with excuses. 3) The prices are not cheap. I frequented KEDA in Torrance, and their prices are roughly 60-70% of even Patsys' discounted prices. They also have jackets in stock, which Patsy's doesn't. 4) The quality was poor. The stitching was severely off-center and a word on my order was misspelled. If you enjoy being swindled, suckered in, or otherwise duped out of your money in exchange for shoddy, rude service and a ruined product, by all means go to Patsy's.", "business_id": "I20i9e32ab6vF2LvdUA54g", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-15", "type": "review"}
