Expect a line on the weekends, and don't waste your time looking for free local parking in the evening. \n\nThe pizzas and salads are TAST-EE, and while the menu isn't really immense, the pizza options are diverse enough to keep you coming back until you (and your friends) have tried them all. I've enjoyed the steak, the sausage, and the straight-up cheese; I recommend all of them, but the sausage especially. The steak and arugala pizza, I've found, is kinda hard to eat, even with a knife and fork. \n\nThe service is attentive without being obtrusive. For neat freak diners, you can guarentee that the seating area and the bathrooms are pretty tidy. I'd recommend going in the spring or summer, because it's not a particularly warm venue. \n\nIn fact, if there's one thing Cambridge One is missing...it's probably heart. The decor is pretty sparse and cold, and the black stone tables remind me of mortuary slabs. Everything is marked by a certain rigidity...while I enjoy my food and I enjoy my company, I'm not always convinced the restaurant enjoys me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "M487o17d25K9Jnrf-bKFQQ"}
