Not as pretentious as a lot of other Harvard Square bars and a great beer selection. Bartenders are super friendly as is the crowd in general. We spent most of the night on the second floor and around 11 the DJ started playing a really fun mix of songs and an awesome dance party ensued. Overall a great, great, time.", "business_id": "bzZ7jQ-RXxsD0heDIUzojQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-16", "type": "review"}
