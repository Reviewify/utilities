The atmosphere was much like a typical run-down sports bar with a large dance floor and a stage for a DJ or a small band. I'm not sure what the typical crowd is like, but on this particular night it was fairly eclectic, ranging from straight up duders all the way to neckbeards and then back to hipsters. Somewhere in that triangular range is where I fit in, and it was surprisingly enjoyable. Within 10 minutes of entering the place I saw a blatant drug deal/pass right on the dance floor, and it set the right tone for the night. After another 20 minutes of dancing someone spilled their entire mixed drink on my back and then ran away. I like to think it was to cool down my hot as ice dance moves. Fortunately for me, I absorb alcohol through osmosis in a process I call awesomeosis. I probably won't be back, but if someone suggests coming here again, I would not protest.", "business_id": "q2EXggq1IIrw20YPSfvJeQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-10", "type": "review"}
