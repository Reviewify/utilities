I've been coming here for lunch about once a week for over 4 years, and I still love it.  Most of their sandwiches are $6.95 and there's a wide assortment of cold and hot sandwiches.  My favorites are the fajita wraps (beef/chicken, lettuce, pepper, onion, sauce in tortilla) and incredible sandbags (turkey, avacado, bacon, tomato, cream cheese, sprouts on wheat).  The sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch for me.  If it's too much food, it's easy to take home because your order comes in its very own lunch bag. If you're a UCLA student you can get a drink and small bag of chips for free.  If you're not, you can get the free drink on thursdays.  Also, most people don't realize they have a stamp card, so if you're a regular, you can get your 11th sandwich free! I'd definitely recommend stopping by when you're in Westwood, you won't find a better sandwich place elsewhere in town.", "business_id": "0OXTdtcR_HnuCPbZ6804Xw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-01", "type": "review"}
