I must have gone at at good time cuz was in & out within 5 minutes.  The service was quick and friendly.  Had peanut butter cookies with banana walnut fudge ice cream. The cookie was slightly warm so it melted the ice cream a little, which was so good! The only minor complaint was the cashier said the small bottled water was $1 but it rang up as $1.25. No biggie. Think I will try 2 different cookies next time...so many options!", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-12", "type": "review"}
