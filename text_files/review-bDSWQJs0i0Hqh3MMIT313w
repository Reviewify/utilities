The cookie was slightly warm so it melted the ice cream a little, which was so good!\nThe only minor complaint was the cashier said the small bottled water was $1 but it rang up as $1.25. No biggie.\nThink I will try 2 different cookies next time...so many options!", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
