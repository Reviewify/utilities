I took a voice acting class over the summer that was pretty good.  It was about $100-$200 cheaper than other classes around town of the same caliber.\r \r The writing classes have a particularly good reputation.  I know a few people who've been really happy with their writing classes there.\r \r Most of the classes allow you to take them on a pass/fail basis or you can request a letter grade.  For some classes, you can get college credit.", "business_id": "3k9PWkWl7WYLySeudeGx6w", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-10-11", "type": "review"}
