I took a voice acting class over the summer that was pretty good.  It was about $100-$200 cheaper than other classes around town of the same caliber.\r\n\r\nThe writing classes have a particularly good reputation.  I know a few people who've been really happy with their writing classes there.\r\n\r\nMost of the classes allow you to take them on a pass/fail basis or you can request a letter grade.  For some classes, you can get college credit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3k9PWkWl7WYLySeudeGx6w"}
