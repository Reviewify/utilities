Its just amazing if you are a vegetarian, like I am, given the number of options they have for you.\n\nMy personal favorite is Chutney's Paneer - I go for a parata wrap if I'm not really that hungry or for the rice bowl otherwise. Their sauces are just too good, be sure to try their Mint Chutney.\n\nValue for money and really a decent enough ambiance to enjoy a quick bite or two. Although the wrap keeps falling apart, I don't complain rather have a reason to put down the silverware and hunt with my hands. :P", "type": "review", "business_id": "sizgsuBgbH1ShRE5iDTjxA"}
