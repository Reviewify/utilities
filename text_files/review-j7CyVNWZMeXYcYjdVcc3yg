I recently bought a thank-you gift there, for a \"women-who-has-everything-incuding-a-very-discerning-taste\" type friend of mine. She loved her glazed tray, and I've seen her use it at a few dinner parties since. It's the kind of store you want to linger in, and feels like the items were hand picked from a recent trip to France (which I gather, they were). They indeed offered free gift wrapping (a clear bag around your item, filled with a few dried flowers... very pretty, but also placed the store wrapped gift inside another gift bag from home). I ended up buying some honey lavender beeswax guest soaps and I think a gardenia soap from the jars behind the counter- the girl working that Saturday was SO patient with me as I wanted to sniff and consider each variety, and even offered suggestions on other scents that I might enjoy based on my reactions to the ones she offered up. I ended up purchasing about 5/6 soaps (which were so delicious smelling that I've gone through all of them myself, note-to-self: must go back and restock for my guests!)... and might I add they were VERY inexpensive, especially for the quality. If you are in the area and have some time, I def. recommend stopping in and perusing their offerings. Perhaps not everything will be in your budget, but I bet you'll find at least a few wonderful things that put a smile on your face.", "business_id": "eWtpYjkvI7HYY5EqNJji4g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}
