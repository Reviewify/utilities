Apparently they didn't honor many things in a contract their own staff had signed. They essentially ruined the party, were difficult and annoying and mysteriously \"didn't receive\" SIX of the liquor bottles that had been dropped off for our party. Aside from that, the music was terrible and was too loud. This, after not allowing us to have our own music for the party. After we finished off the booze they did manage to serve us (from one, slow bartender they had working), we literally grabbed our birthday cake and moved the whole party down the street to Noir (which rules). I've popped in once or twice since then--against my better judgement... I wouldn't say the crowd was \"hipster douchebag,\" as another reviewer put it--just kind of lame and totally out-of-synch with the rest of the d\u00e9cor. I suppose this is a good place to hang if you're a Harvard student with a fake ID, but if not then I'd recommend you stay the eff away from here. Definitely one of the lamest bars in Cambridge.", "business_id": "vfat4AeWHMgamDTeM9xS2A", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-08", "type": "review"}
