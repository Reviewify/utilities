It is without a doubt one of the most unique  hot dog places because the buns are replaced with a stack of Hawaiian bread!  Service is fast and the cashier was also friendly.  The ambience is rowdy from all the fryers and whatnot during busy hours, but it tends to quite down around 3 pm which makes it ideal for a casual lunch with friends.  I would definitely recommend the Bratwurst or Spicy Italian topped off with caramelized onions and sweet peppers or sauerkraut (awwwwww....foodgasm).  You will not be disappointed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg"}
