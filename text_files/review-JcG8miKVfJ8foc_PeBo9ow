My boyfriend & I came 15 minutes before closing but everyone was still welcoming. We were seated quickly & our waiter was very helpful. We asked him for the steak with the most fats, and he suggested the Ribeye STEAK. Yum!!! It came with roasted potatoes which were also yum!  I recommend this place :)", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-17", "type": "review"}
