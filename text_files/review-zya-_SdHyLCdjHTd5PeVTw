This one is HUGE compared to the one in Burlingame, but small compared to the one in Union Square and NYC :-)  They have the cutest fashion and home accessories!  I can only afford the sales racks but when I was here a few weeks ago to pick up some presents for friends, this location had a lot of sales items! Oh how I can't wait to go back!!  The staff was really helpful with getting me boxes to fit my odd shaped presents and they just looked so adorable in their boxes when they were all wrapped up.", "business_id": "AB2EgekwtXiXfzi8_FL30w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-03", "type": "review"}
