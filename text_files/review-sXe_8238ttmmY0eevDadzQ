It was so easy, I laid in the comfortable chair the whole time and watched a movie. They gave me as many blankets as I needed, and a bunch of hot water packs. They are all experienced and so friendly; it makes donating that much more satisfying! Donating platelets was different than donating blood for a few reasons. It takes about 1.5 hours for platelet donation but because of the movie (they have a billion movies by the way, it's so hard to choose which one to watch!) , that passes by quickly. They also filter out the platelets and put the remaining fluid back in your body. That sounds weird, but because they use the same needle, it's not a bigi deal. They also put this other fluid in you that makes your lips, fingers and toes all tingly. It felt weird... but cool :D And the benefits are awesome. You're helping out, and you get 3 movie tickets, worker's comp/meal tickets, a cooler bag (I think this depends on the time that you go though), and you get entered into drawings for gift cards and other cool things! GO GO GO GO GO DOOOO IT!", "business_id": "hC5-IFAE5U2CObQmivGesQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-06-26", "type": "review"}
