The point is that I come here more often than i should and I walk in and the line always has 8 people in it. They are doing so well over there that they always make the line move super fast and the orders come out fast too. AND they listen when I say 7 layer burrito no guacamole! Which is really exciting for me since I'm allergic to guacamole and if its in there I can't eat :( Good job Vermont Taco Bell!", "business_id": "TsxBE0dpdbgRtjsZoYPPNw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-08", "type": "review"}
