They are doing so well over there that they always make the line move super fast and the orders come out fast too.  AND they listen when I say 7 layer burrito no guacamole!  Which is really exciting for me since I'm allergic to guacamole and if its in there I can't eat :(\n\nGood job Vermont Taco Bell!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TsxBE0dpdbgRtjsZoYPPNw"}
