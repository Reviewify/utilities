The staff is generally helpful but not particularly friendly. I never feel appreciated or anything like that when I'm here.\n\nOne time I came by and the outside ATM was either out of money or out of order. I can't remember if the ones by the parking area were working. I almost never remember that another ATM exists on that side...\n\nMy last visit there was when I realized I didn't have my wallet on me and needed to give a business money in 30 minutes. I am kind of thankful that they did require me to have my debit card and/or federally issued form of ID, but what the heck was with suggesting I wait in line to talk to the manager (when I'm already low on time)... especially when they already tell me that the manager probably can't do anything and my time will probably be wasted!?!? (Thankfully I soon figured out that the business could bill me instead of having me pay up front.)\n\nThe only reason I've ever gone to this branch is because it's in a convenient location and frequently within walking distance. But- gah- I don't like it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XN3_SMaF_AY1wf8KvCYGig"}
