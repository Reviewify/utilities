We sat outside since we had the pup with us but it took about 15 minutes for a waitress to give us any attention.  We placed our order with her and 5 minutes later had a man come by and inform that he will be taking over.  Another 10 minutes go by and the waitress that had taken our order comes back and asks why we don't have any bread on the table.  Hmmm...were we to go get the bread our selves?   About 5 minutes later we got bread and it was nice and warm. We ordered... Mojito - very good The Pink Panther - not good at all (don't know why my husband ordered this) Nachos - my husband liked it Penne Alfredo with Shrimp - good (wish there was a little more sauce) As far as the service, I can't say anything great.  The food was good but it wasn't the best I've had.  The best part of this experience was my mojito. No heaters outside so don't sit outside unless it's a warm day. Not sure if I'll be back.", "business_id": "KhzhIIKHTno6QkGcXBqhrQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-11", "type": "review"}
