Free salsa and chips right from the get go. Their drinks are Super cheap. I recommend the slushy variation for a more girly, less alcoholic experience. The hurricane is good if you really want to taste some rum. Their Jambalaya sides are delicious, so I heard. Taco salad is HUGE. Vegetarian Burro was delectable. The portions here are amazing. They accommodated 2 tables of 9 for us within 15 minutes of waiting. My boyfriend accidentally spilled his drink, but the servers were really nice about cleaning it up and even gave us a free replacement... which brings me to service. I loved our waitress! I will definitely be coming back when I get another craving for Mexican food. Also, to all those people who cry and moan about how there is no authentic Mexican food around here. You probably wouldn't like authentic Mexican food if you tried it anyways. The real 'authentic' stuff is made with lard and greasy corn meal.", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-10", "type": "review"}
