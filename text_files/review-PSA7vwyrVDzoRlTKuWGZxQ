I recommend the slushy variation for a more girly, less alcoholic experience. The hurricane is good if you really want to taste some rum.\nTheir Jambalaya sides are delicious, so I heard.\nTaco salad is HUGE.\nVegetarian Burro was delectable.\nThe portions here are amazing.\nThey accommodated 2 tables of 9 for us within 15 minutes of waiting.\nMy boyfriend accidentally spilled his drink, but the servers were really nice about cleaning it up and even gave us a free replacement...\nwhich brings me to service. I loved our waitress!\nI will definitely be coming back when I get another craving for Mexican food.\nAlso, to all those people who cry and moan about how there is no authentic Mexican food around here. You probably wouldn't like authentic Mexican food if you tried it anyways. The real 'authentic' stuff is made with lard and greasy corn meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A"}
