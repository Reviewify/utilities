I had an Asian Chicken Salad and it totally lacked any flavor. I felt like I was eating the lettuce straight from the field along with some super dry chicken! If there was any salad dressing for it, I sure wasn't able to taste it. Our server seemed to be MIA for most of our meal and we had to chase him down for our check as well as chase him down to take care of it. Sorry Neiman but you make a good point if setting yourself apart but you need to back it up with quality and service which I felt was lacking based on my experience here.", "business_id": "hYIF36Iq282ozuX4spoS3A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-23", "type": "review"}
