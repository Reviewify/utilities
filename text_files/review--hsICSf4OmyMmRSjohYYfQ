However, the order my office got the other day was disappointing especially since I worked there in highschool. There was  live bug in one of my friend's sandwiches. In addition there was a hair in my other friend's turkey sandwich. To top it off, there was a long hair in my boss' salad. There were about 10 orders and it was ridiculous that there were so many issues. (my sandwich based on inspection was ok) They need to start wearing hair nets or something because that service is unacceptable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hwCthMrt77pywJA7Q6T_9Q"}
