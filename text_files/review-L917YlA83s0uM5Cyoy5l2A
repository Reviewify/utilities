Had some great help from the server about the menu and his suggestions. So we ordered the Spicy Jerk Chicken with a DAHLPURI, and the Spicy string beans. Let me tell you they were spicy, but very good! \nThe Chicken came with a leg and a thigh, rice and a salad with apples in it. Like I said it was spicy the salad was refreshing and the rice was tasty. The green beans were cooked well and were not as spicy as the chicken. The dahlpuri was a life-saver in the fact that you could rip a piece off and wrap the chicken in it and made it less spicy. The chickpeas in it are ground and are really soft and tasty. Note, the condiment jar on the table is not fruity, but a habanero sauce so if you need more spice they have it. \n\nThe only draw back to Pam's is that we wanted the coconut ice cream and the Cassava Pone-Cake and they were out of both. Both of our mouths were still on fire after the meal!", "type": "review", "business_id": "n4A61MWiTz6ZpiUBVQLcjA"}
