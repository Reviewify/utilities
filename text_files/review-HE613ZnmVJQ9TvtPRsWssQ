I walk past Berkeley Thai House everyday on my way to solve challenging problems. I can't help but be distracted every time I walk pass here. From the stairwell entrance, the luring smell entices me to have a civilized sit-down meal. Quick service here for lunch. If you are on a time crunch and want a decent healthy meal, perhaps even vegetarian, Thai House has an ample selection of curries, noodles, rice dishes for the budget-aware Berkeley students. Lunchable. I am impressed by their lunch specials. Today they had prawns with Thai basil, red & green peppers, mushrooms and bamboo. The proportion is good enough to split between 2 people. It is a cool spot for a casual lunch date on the weekdays. Several sunny yet private locations for intimate conversations. Blend is the name of the game for Thai food in the Bay. I am quite disappointed by the lack of spice, vigor and heat in their dishes. If you are a fan of hot, spicy food, make sure you tell your waiter to jazz it up a notch. Here's my personal experience with Thai places. Please do not take offense. Before I started going to Thai places with my girlfriend, when I ask for hot, it's full of heat & grasp. However, due to my girlfriend's ethnicity, even though she adores the hottest food on the planet, sometimes even more than me, the waiter always seem to tone it down according to her skin color....I don't know why...but just a thought. Bottom line: Cheaper if you split the plate. Get lunch specials. Skip the long lines at other places.", "business_id": "tR7wIIvJsLqI8keoLf8tpg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-01-30", "type": "review"}
