I spent my first 21 years of life absolutely abhorring eggs, so the past few years (really, who's counting?) have been a total egg-awakening.  A time to explore, really.\n\nAnyway, I'd really recommend that you avoid having your first experience with a soft-boiled egg in a public place, particularly on a busy pedestrianized strip in Westwood, dining at a restaurant where tables are but a few inches apart.  Eating a soft-boiled egg is something that appears to take practice-- at least, I need to practice because I didn't do so well.  Fortunately, my dining companion flung part of her waffle to the ground to ease my embarrassment.\n\nAside from the awkwardness of eating a soft-boiled egg for the first time, my Sunday brunch at Le Pain Quotidien was an excellent experience.  My egg was good, the bread served with it was delicious, and I loved my croissant that I ordered on the side.  My carafe of iced tea was excellent as well.  It was wonderful, actually, to have regular old black ice tea, no sugar or fruit infusions added.  Yay.  \n\nThe much raved about hazelnut spread was indeed worth writing home  about.  Or emailing your friend that lives in Belgium and demanding it for an Easter present.  \n\nI didn't exactly feel like I was at a sidewalk cafe in Belgium, but that's probably because I wasn't hungover.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rbc9eyODP68T_DFzIYuNNQ"}
