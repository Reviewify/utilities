Great burgers and a reasonable beer selection from the various restaurants I've gone to so far.\n\nAs a bar, however. Oh, my God! Don't get me started!\n\nIt's just a bigger version of The Library in my opinion.\n\n- Same tiring Top 40 as The Library plays because the DJ is either too moronic to play something different or the DJ wants to serve the moronic audience.\n\n- Same Jersey Shore wannabes and Maury show wannabes that walk in the bar as the Library. The attire at this bar is to have your pants below your buttocks, wear Air Jordans, and have facial jewelery. In general, if you look like a gentleman and not like a wife beater, then don't expect to be given a second look from females. Men. Don't even bother looking for quality females here. It's like finding a Cadillac in a Kia dealership.\n\n- Still not worth the $3.00 admission at all. In general, I think I'm done with bars. I'll stick to drinking with close friends from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wYV-Fbym_EIgq4DIEiqfhg"}
