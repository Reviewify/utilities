At this time of year, Tanino just hits the spot.  I stopped in for a drink this evening with a friend which turned into dinner.  We both had pasta; me a simple penne arrabiata and my companion pumpkin tortelloni in a sage cream sauce, their signature dish. As always, my penne arrabiata was perfectly seasoned and didn't leave me feeling like a lead balloon.  My dinner companion is a very finnicky eater that had a late lunch.  When his pumpkin tortelloni arrived he scarfed down almost the whole plate in mintues.  The pasta is made fresh in house.  Tanino is a very warm and inviting host; he greeted us at the door as we walked in.  Other dishes I highly recommend: any risotto dish, the seafood linguini and the raviolis.  I never eat meat or fish dishes because I can't resist the pasta so I am not much help critiquing them. The decor is beautiful; incredible molded ceilings, a very inviting fireplace and a general warmth about the space.
