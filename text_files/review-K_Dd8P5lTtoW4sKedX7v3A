Yes, the idea is fun: an Indian Chipotle. But the gimmick wears off really quickly when you've had their food.  I've eaten here three times (It's across the street from where I work) and I can honestly say it's very poor indian food.  \n\nThe Karahi Paneer is the best thing I've had and even that is missing something essential. I don't know what, but it just is. \n\nThe cholay is blah.  I'd rather eat the frozen trader joe's cholay than have this.\n\nIf this place was a dollar or two cheaper, then I'd boost it a star, but the paneer wrap is $7, which is more expensive than a chipotle burrito (and not even close to being as good).  \n\nThe best thing this place has going for it is it's convenience to the UCB campus.  I might still try it on an odd day when I'm sick of eating at Northside Cafe or Jasmine Thai, but I don't imagine it happening anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-t6JanEk_V6VzctlTyr6eA"}
