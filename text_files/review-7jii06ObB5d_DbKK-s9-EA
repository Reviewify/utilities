Cuchi Cuchi definitely does just that! There isnt much to say that hasn't been said... atmosphere is quirky and fun, the staff really get into dressing up which adds a lot to the charm, the signature drinks are out of this world, and most of the dishes I had were superb. I wasnt impressed with the pork rolls... they were dry and flavorless. I loved the tuna tartare cornets and the moroccan chicken; they were melting in my mouth. Cant wait to have them again. Go to this place if you are looking for an intimate setting with a quirky panache and tasty small dishes to share.", "business_id": "C7FKNwSUlbUinT9cRSLXHA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-26", "type": "review"}
