The value is tremendous. $9 including tip includes a huge variety of Indian-ish, Chinese-ish dishes. TONS of veggie options (stir-fried tofu with bok choy, curried cauliflower and potatoes, vegetable noodle dish, three different salads, two different kids of soup, cut up fruit), as well as some a chicken and beef curry dish. Two different kinds of bread (sort of like naan) and fried appetizers similar to what you would find in an Indian restaurant. The list goes on. Some of the food was a little greasy, which was unlike dinner.  I'd happily go again for lunch or dinner, but lunch is a great value and a ton of variety.", "business_id": "HxegWRjhi7m73mXRI8qQIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-11", "type": "review"}
