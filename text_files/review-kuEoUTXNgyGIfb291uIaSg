Then JJ's is for you! Props for (a) not being Subway and (b) not smelling like Subway (although if JJs was as ubiquitous as Subway, no doubt their own odor would become as recognizably offensive). In fairness, you can custom a tastier sandwich than the standards -- choose the wheat bread instead of the French bread, add hot peppers, and ask them to go light on or nix the mayo, and you've got a serviceable lunch. One selling point: they deliver by bike, so it's environmentally friendly or something. Anticipate your sandwich being a bit mooshed upon arrival if you choose this option. Also, plan to pay with or at least tip with cash -- you can't add a tip on the receipt if you prepay with a card.", "business_id": "Ea-ZuT5DKD188BpRMTDyGA", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-04", "type": "review"}
