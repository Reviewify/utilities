Anyways, my friends had already arrived at the place and we started off quick with a \"salted crispy chicken\" as appetizer. Then we ordered the following dishes \"smoked duck taiwanese style,\" \"house special fish,\" \"eal with sticky rice,\" \"shredded pig's tripe,\" \"eggplant w/basil,\" and \"lamb hot pot.\" By god, that was a lot of food, probably more food than we thought we ordered but it was too late since we realized that only after the dishes started to come out as my friends and I were too busy in catching up and having fascinating conversations. But anyways back to the restaurant, the place was good sized and could probably seat like 50-60 people if it's packed but we went right before thanksgiving and it was about 75% packed. As for the dishes, they were all very very good. The salted crispy chicken was lightly fried and just the right amount of salt flavour. The eggplant was really good too and the lamb hot pot was surprisingly tasty as there wasn't a huge lamb smell and the meat was very tender. I guess the only dish I was okay on was the sticky rice eal. It looked good on presentation but when I ate it, it was just good, thought it would tasted better but my friend and I both commented that it wasn't as integrated as a dish could be, but both he and I have no clue what da hell that meant but it sounded right by both of us. As for the atmosphere, it was on the quite side as everyone was busy eating their own food and enjoying their own company. The waitresses were quite friendly and very serviceable but I wouldn't label them easy on the eyes though. Other than that, everything was very very good and definitely would come back again. Just make sure you allocate enough time to drive around the area looking for parking as space was extremely limited and street parking was limited due to permit parking only.", "business_id": "dJb67-qXGCAAFB7IQ9M-aQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-25", "type": "review"}
