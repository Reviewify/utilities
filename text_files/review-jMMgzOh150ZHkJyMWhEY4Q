A salad with a Salmon fillet cooked to order will run you about $6.  Amazing for NYC!  The dining hall itself is a beautiful old room which feels like a connection to the past academics who've walked the halls.  Breakfast is good too.  Always lots of options for grilled-to-order items, salads, soup, pizza, etc.", "business_id": "yw2yc4OlDDf-5g9DcUtpuw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-04", "type": "review"}
