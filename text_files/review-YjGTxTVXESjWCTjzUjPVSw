My boyfriend and I had brunch here late on a Sunday afternoon. Previously we've been to other neighborhood haunts, but never will I ever go to them again for breakfast, for we have found the Holy Grail! The food was just amazing. I had the Huevos Rancheros and he had the French Toast. My eggs were done just right and the beans were cooked perfectly and we well seasoned. The French toast was 2 extra larges pieces of bread with bananas, strawberries and a syrup that tasted like the drippings of a bananas foster desert. I wish I could give this 4.5 stars as the food took just a little to long to be served, but my taste buds keep shouting MORE MORE MORE!", "type": "review", "business_id": "U7UVERrPVvLJ8HN6TI92DQ"}
