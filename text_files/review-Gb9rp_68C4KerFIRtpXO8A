LOVE it!\n\nTheir pizza rocks, as do their salads and sandwiches. Twice I've had their poached salmon salad sandwich, and it was a tasty as it was messy. Keep in mind that their menu changes pretty often, so don't get hooked on any one thing ~ it might not be there next time! Also, if they say they're all out of a particular beer, and it was the beer your heart was set on, say something. I lamented when they said they were all out of their L'Amour Du Jour, and then the waitress said they had a little bit left that I could have. I could have kissed her feet.\n\nIf you have a group of beer lovers, you can get a TOWER of BEER! It's 100 ounces of pure goodness. You can't go wrong here.\n\nI got one of their shirts, and wore it to the Beer Advocate American Craft Beer Festival, and I met their head brewer, Will Meyers. He complimented me on my shirt, and I complimented him on his beer. I think I fell in love that day. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Bmvu1grPzxECp7dxm8zerA"}
