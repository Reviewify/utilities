And I was actually astonished by the size and number of people in here. Whilst we didn't get anything here, other than water and a few hard boiled eggs (which are apparently FREE), I am appreciative of the staff. They were super nice, in that we couldn't decide what we wanted to do since they stopped serving food. We didn't order any drinks - but they do have a HUGE drinks list from the menu I saw. And they kept checking up on us and refilled our waters while we occupied their space when they didn't have to.  Thumbs up to B-Side. I will need to return at some point and try you out for real.", "business_id": "qnRO5swUiQ2dNHuHRbAIzg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-02-15", "type": "review"}
