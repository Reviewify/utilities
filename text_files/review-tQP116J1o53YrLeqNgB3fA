There is also a chicken katsu oyakodon, but we often simply stick with our first love as a nostalgic reminder of our college years. For the amount of food, the prices are relatively fair as even we find ourselves beyond satiation when we leave the restaurant. For example, the oyakodon comes in what appears to be a large soup bowl, for size comparison, and is literally filled to the brim with rice. Only then is the bowl topped with chicken or chicken katsu and eggs which will likely destroy anyone for a month if they were on any sort of low carbohydrate diet. While it may not be worth your while if you are not already in the area, the restaurant is worth the visit if you are trying to fill up on a meal especially if you are looking to do it on the cheap.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_rlU6AQD8jJJb7iCiHrRdg"}
