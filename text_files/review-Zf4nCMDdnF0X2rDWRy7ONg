I stopped by last Wednesday to catch the USA v T&T game and have some dinner and a few beers. The wait staff was friendly as always and very helpful. They informed me of their new menu. I ordered the Irish Cheeseburger and my friend ordered the soup and salad. Let me tell you, I was impressed. You expect decent bar food but they actually put some serious effort into the food, the appearance on the plate and the taste, just right! Irish cheeseburger was so good, I can't wait to get back to Central Square to have one. Burger and a beer cost about $13.", "business_id": "q2EXggq1IIrw20YPSfvJeQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-14", "type": "review"}
