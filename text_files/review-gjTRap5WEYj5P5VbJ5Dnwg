It is more like what we get in Chipotle but the ingredients are very Indian and I loooooooved it ! When it comes to sauces, u'll understand why the restaurant is named Chutneys. coz they are not sauces but Indian chutneys packed in sauce bottles. I tasted the Chutney's Chicken with Rice and some Chutneys they had on a Paratha wrap and my friend had Chutney's paneer with rice on Nanini and we both loved it. Nice place, nice food and i'll go there as often as possible !", "business_id": "sizgsuBgbH1ShRE5iDTjxA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-10", "type": "review"}
