MMM delicious!!!\n\nI've been frequenting this place since I was a young teenager and it never disappoints my cravings.  The food is spicier here than say, Cactus Club.  I've had everything from the burrito to the enchilada to the tacos to the fajitas.  All are delicious, with decent portions for their pricing.  The sides can be a bit on the weaker end (jambalaya and beans) but they are still tasty and mix well with the actual entrees.  I've noticed items come and go on their menus but for the most part, everything that I like to eat has been a mainstay.\n\nMy drinks have never been weak but frankly, I am not too big a fan of a margarita with a strong tequila bite so to be honest, I cannot really judge on drinks.  I am a huge fan of the strawberry marg, however.\n\nIf you drop in on the weekends, definitely be prepared to wait.  Even though I gave it a 3-star rating, it is a very high 3-star rating.  I definitely recommend this place... mostly for their chips and salsa.  To die for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A"}
