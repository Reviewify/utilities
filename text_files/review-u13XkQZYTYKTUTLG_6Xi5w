I also heard its gets really crowded, and because I have a general dislike for people (strange since I was a Psychology major) came here at 11:30. And like a genious there wasnt a crowd. Well my friend's a Ho (thats his last name) and was running late and as the time ticked by, I saw more people get in line and order this legendary pizza. So thus I made an executive decision and said screw my friend Im getting in line. No idea what to get, didnt do research and decided to go with old trusty Margherita (u have 2 other options, Bianca (Honestly, a pizza without red sauce is lame and non-traditionalist) and Neapolitano (pizza needs cheese). Then you order your toppings and like a boss got the Calibria Chiles and Sausage on mine. I chose quite wisely as my pizza was rather divine, the chiles on it gave it nice kick. Also a good thing I ididnt wait for my friend cuz he was stuck in line as my pizza finished cooking and was ready for me to eat and of course I ate it as he looked at me. His Fault. At first I thought it was alot for pizza, but actually its so thin, that 1 is quite right.", "business_id": "jGuzp8hsKy27ZmK1jsvgYw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}
