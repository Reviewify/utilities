But I'm giving it a 2star because it's much cheaper than some other Chinese restaurants(ex: lotus house, mandarin house) that charge much more for something that's just as average OR even worse (beware). Lastly, quality of service here is comparable to the food it serves.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8Xq5VtwYjayKlxEY2PipQA"}
