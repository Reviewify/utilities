I had a gyro, which was just fine, about average.  The pita could not hold up, so had to eat the last half with a fork, which was annoying. I did not care for the hummus, maybe one of the blandest versions I have eaten. Service was fine. The fried chips were average, not as good as I expected based on the reviews.", "business_id": "8EqhQa4rn0kJ9B11l_cwfg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-10-10", "type": "review"}
