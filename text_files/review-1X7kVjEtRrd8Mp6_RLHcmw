The bartender's here are fantastic. I really love the service here and I always come here with friends when they visit. I feel the negative service complaints may be from wiper packed weekends like dads weekend or homecoming where every bar will be backed up. I love this bar and many of my college memories came from here", "business_id": "jK8PNNtv4RI6m-xd-tGjPQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-02-11", "type": "review"}
