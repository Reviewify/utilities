If you are visitor, then DO NOT PARK HERE. First you must park, no problem, you'd have to do that anywhere.  Then, remember your parking space number, because you will have to then go pay for your parking and place the ticket on your dash (that's fine, pretty routine).  Here comes the ridiculous part: You have to visit one of the only 2 payment machines. There's one on the 1st floor, and one one the 2nd, only those two. Most likely you will park on the 4th, or 3rd floor, because it is busy during the day so you will have to go pay near the entrance, then come back to your car. So. This means, you have to park, go pay for parking (in advance, do you know how long you will be there? You better), THEN you have to return to your car to place the ticket on your dash. Okay... that is a little dumb, but that's not a problem. IT GETS BETTER!!! None of the machines accept credit cards. They do not accept change. They DO NOT give change. So if your total is $8 and all you have is a $20 bill, then you'll be paying $20.  This is the most absurd payment system I've ever seen/heard of. The payment system is a total rip-off.
