There were about 22 guest and they had the food set up buffet style. It was all you can drink sodas, all you can eat salad and all you can eat pizza(choice of 4 different types of pizzas). Our sodas and salads were replenished at a decent rate, however they took a long time to bring out new pizzas, so we were sitting there for a while waiting...and the longer we waited the less hungry we got. Maybe that's their system, to make us wait a long time between the pizzas so that people eat less. The salad was ok, my soda was soda and I must say the pizza's were delicious. This is the order I would rate the pizzas, 1.Great white 2.buffalo chicken 3.bbq chicken 4.artichoke spinach. All in all the food was good, service was ok, and the price was very reasonable ($16.50 each including tax and tip).", "business_id": "FjmEYsEtRNaerkOjh07wSQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-28", "type": "review"}
