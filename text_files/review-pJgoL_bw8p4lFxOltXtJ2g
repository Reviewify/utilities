I am additionally skeptical when this is said to me in Rhode Island.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the lack of real authentic Mexican food, this was not a mexican restaurant, however as a Tex Mex place it was pretty good. \n\nBBQ sauce was used like salsa for the most part and the quesadillas were more often stuffed with bison and grilled onions more than carnitas. \n\n\nOver all Meh on the food, but I had excellent company so that made up for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MGOt6JSu0NPI-DKhWRTTeA"}
