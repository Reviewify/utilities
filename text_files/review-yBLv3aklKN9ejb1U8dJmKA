So far it's been fun. My experience with Tory Row was not horrible, not wonderful, just okay. Pro:My friend and I shared the curry apricot cheese spread, which despite my reservations about its name was a great mix of sweet with just enough of a kick that you could feel it but didn't have to reach for your water glass. It was the best part of the night. The sangria was full of fruit and went down easy too, so it was second best.The bartender gave us our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Con: My friend had the veggie burger, which we had to wait at least 20mins for despite the bartender assuring us that it was coming up in a minute. Not his fault but it got old having to hear that on a Tuesday night when the place was not dead but not exactly hopping either. Bartender wasn't very engaging but he still did a decent job. I don't expect bartenders to want to hear my life story but some small talk would have been nice.We would have had dessert but considering all they had was a brownie with ice cream we passed. Seriously, you only have one dessert on the menu? One? Verdict: Not exactly against this place, but there are plenty of better places in Harvard Square to spend your money at.", "business_id": "ddMVvuSQ6zqzpzVql-pa4A", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}
