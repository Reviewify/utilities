I thought the food was not special- and the soup we had was awful. The service was pretentious and the prices extortionate. Not nearly up to the standards of Magnolia Grill or Nana's. The food was not as good a Ill Palio. Will not return.", "business_id": "zwNficyc3GVH5b8Y26Kv_g", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-19", "type": "review"}
