The service and decor has that national chain vibe to it. I tried the Spicy Lemon Chicken Ramen, it was solid, but not spectacular. The spicy broth was the best part about it. I thought the lemon flavor overpowered the bowl. The Beef Yakisoba was decent as well. The beef was flavorful and the noodles were good. However for $12 bucks it was not a very large serving. It's a good place to eat at in the U Village if you're nearby. It's not someplace I would go out of my way for though.", "business_id": "2DEz094o_CZQo2m_rQSoqw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-19", "type": "review"}
