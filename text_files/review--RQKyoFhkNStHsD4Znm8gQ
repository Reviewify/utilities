It is reasonably priced, but their appetizers are very costly. Their food was very fun (hence the \"fusion\" in their title). Their menu was full of rolls and they had great lunch specials. Their presentation is very good for eat-in orders. I rarely eat in. I prefer take-out. I call ahead and by the time I get there, my order is ready and my bill is error-free. I have tried many rolls and other dishes. There is not one that I did not like. My only problem was there were so many choices, it was hard to concentrate on just one when I was hungry. The tan curry was good. Their \"half price\" nigiri was fresh. I always get a few of those. Their service was good. Their location is very convenient to BART and the UCB campus, so it is a quick walk to satisfaction. I will be going there often while I am too busy to grocery shop.", "business_id": "e_8TvfKT6QT81snfrqYYTw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-03", "type": "review"}
