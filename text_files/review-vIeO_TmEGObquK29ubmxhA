The decor is nice, but unfortunately it all kind of ends there.  There really weren't that many choices available on the bar.  The flavor was just okay.  The tandoori chicken was a little dry and rubbery.  The other items on the bar tasted very similar to each other.  They did have something that looked like an empanada that was really good.  Not good enough to give the place three starts.  I probably wouldn't recommend the place to anyone unless they just had to eat Indian buffet in that area, and I probably won't be returning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_--ScmaNumIoT2gQanACvg"}
