As a consumer we look for communication on initial order, taste of food, temperature and quickness of service. Columbia Cottage hits the mark on all four key criteria points. I would order Chinese as part of my rotation of take out restaurants. I found the food to have a balance of flavors in true Americanize Chinese. I pretty much order the standby dishes, shredded beef or chicken, dumplings, pork fried rice, lo mien, etc. Nothing fancy just good delicious entrees and appetizers. I guess about 10 years ago friends recommended this place. Their main reason for ordering was quick delivery. They would tell us that food would arrive between 10 to 15 minutes. I did not believe until I placed my first order and it arrived in 10 minutes or less. It was hot, delicious and very good for Americanize Chinese. Yummy. Delivery was always fast. Lighting fast. I only lived 4 blocks and one avenue over not very far. I have placed orders at other near by Chinese restaurants and it has taken much longer in time. Average delivery time 20 plus minutes..........", "business_id": "rGEeBgbztKbFDh4kum8x1w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-09", "type": "review"}
