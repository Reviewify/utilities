It's a good way to try out all their beer.  We ordered the RB appetizer sampler which consisted of a lot of artery clogging finger foods. After the beer and the appetizers, I somehow managed to eat my chicken waldorf salad.  I liked it.  I think I would have liked it more if I wasn't so full.  It had spinach, dried cranberries, dried slices of apple and was topped off with a sweet dressing.  I also tried the mahi mahi fish tacos.  That was okay.  The fish was a bit dry.  After all this food, I had no room for dessert.   This was your typical brewery with your average food.  It's not a bad place to hang out and shoot the breeze.", "business_id": "oIgx5AEdeBnsibH7GJc2fg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-22", "type": "review"}
