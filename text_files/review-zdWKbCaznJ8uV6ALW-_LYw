The menu was small yet varied and I actually had a hard time choosing between 4 entrees. My friend and I ordered cocktails first- his a lime/rosemary concoction and mine a currant tea/thyme/gin cocktail. I didn't like his, but the currant tea drink was tasty. We ordered the fried chickpeas and fried green tomatoes to start. The chickpeas were good, and the tomatoes were decent. I say decent because they needed salt and more of the cheese fondue. My friend, a vegan asked if the chef could prepare a vegan option and they were happy to oblige. He ended up with a curried vegetable dish that he liked. I ordered the pork loin with cauliflower puree, brussels sprouts and pork confit. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish, though wished for more cauliflower. It seems to me that the other reviews of this place all say the same thing: the best part of the dish came in the smallest portion. Hopefully they fix that. Oh and, my pork was a little chilly, but I overlooked it in favor of it being cooked correctly.", "business_id": "hlA7e9LQ4hPyohmQh4G8RA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-09-28", "type": "review"}
