I would say one would have to be comfortable with going to Harlem and being in a very foreign-seeming setting to enjoy this place. There were tables of Senegalese hanging out, socializing over food and drinks, really a fun experience to sit in the midst of this. A casual atmosphere. The waitress was very quick, attentive, and nice (and we were two women - I see some reviewers recommend going with men to get good service), and the food was great. I had lamb with rice, with stewed onions on the side (and an extremely hot little green pepper on top, be very careful!), and my friend had the grilled whole talapia fish. The food was very tasty and fresh. I love the mix of spices used in West African food - very flavorful without being spicy. The check came quickly. Everything is very affordable, for New York City as well as for the size of the portions: $11 for my dish and $13 for my friend's fish, if I remember correctly. I will definitely go back and recommend it to friends.", "business_id": "ZcTI78WOKE-iLAzAGccOvA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-09", "type": "review"}
