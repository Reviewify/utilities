There are just too many good brunch places nearby for this place to stand out. If you're a UCLA student without a car, this is a nice place to take your girl the morning after. It's easy to spend $30 for two people for brunch. Their teas are really good and their soups have never disappointed me. Most of their food is made from fresh and organic ingredients. You should definitely try all of their spreads on some bread. If you're a dieter, watch out for their calories. Although their food is healthy, most entrees are between 500-800 calories. They had the numbers listed on their menu for a little while, but then took them off again because it was scaring away the costumers.", "business_id": "rbc9eyODP68T_DFzIYuNNQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}
