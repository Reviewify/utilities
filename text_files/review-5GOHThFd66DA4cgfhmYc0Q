Been a Venus customer for 11+ years now. Always find everything I need in one place. Hooray. One complaint: everytime I go, which granted isn't often, because I tend to buy the gargantuan size of everything I need so I won't have to make more than my annual visit, the prices have increased.

Can't get those super huge sizes everywhere, and surely not at CVS and/or Walgreen's!", "business_id": "S1q4rYyuuFyKcH2ZAsuGFA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-15", "type": "review"}
