Been a Venus customer for 11+ years now. Always find everything I need in one place. Hooray.\n\nOne complaint: everytime I go, which granted isn't often, because I tend to buy the gargantuan size of everything I need so I won't have to make more than my annual visit, the prices have increased.\n\nAhh, well, price of convenience, perhaps? Can't get those super huge sizes everywhere, and surely not at CVS and/or Walgreen's!", "type": "review", "business_id": "S1q4rYyuuFyKcH2ZAsuGFA"}
