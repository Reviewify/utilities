I ordered a carolina BBQ turkey burger and i loved it. The slaw on the burger was great to hold in the sauce which did become messy anyways. It is a bit expensive though. Another visit i had the new american salad or whatever it's called. It was big and that was the best part. I like this place and yeah, flat patties is good but the nutritional information is appealing to me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BTOz5Mmq-nJC92ck48vjKA"}
