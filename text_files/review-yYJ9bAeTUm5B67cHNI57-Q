I didn't want to give up these boots but was worried about getting them fixed, as I hadn't done this before. I decided to take them to Best-Made Shoes and am incredibly happy that I did. First of all, the guy who helped me was incredibly nice and understanding. He was flexible in when my boots would be repaired and had them ready right on time. At first I thought that $30 might be a little steep to replace heels, but once I saw them I was incredibly happy. The heels are perfect now! They made sure to blend the colors together so that it looks like one seamless piece- you have to examine the up close to see where the new heel piece was added. They even polished my boots so nicely that they look better than when I first bought them! I highly recommend this place for shoe repairs.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d65kicaKohFwQmByS0duyA"}
