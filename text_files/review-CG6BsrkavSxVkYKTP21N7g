My absolute favorite is the Portuguese sweet bread cupcake. Yeah, that happened and it's delish. \n\nSecondly, it's flipping adorable in there. It's a small place that's posh without being snotty. The room with the cupcake bar has white leather booths, a fireplace, handsome lighting fixtures, lots of crown molding and did I mention a cupcake bar?! \n\nThe staff are very accommodating, friendly and an attractive bunch (who said that?)\n\nGreat food all around. I've had their finger sandwiches, scones, breads and lots of cupcakes and I've never been disappointed. They also have a large selection of teas and espresso drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BbkF6j51IbcX-ed1f-bnhA"}
