Couldn't they get Jim Kelly who actually played for Buffalo? Hello!!! buffalo wing. I love buffalo wings but i hate wing stop more than ever. I walked in, was greeted promptly and i placed my order for their 10 wing special with fries and a drink. As i waited patiently for my meal a few more people came in to order some food. The cashiers instead of taking their orders right away opted to take phone orders and made them wait. After 20 mins of waiting with just 6 patrons already eating my to go order was finally ready. My meal sucked. The wings were tiny compared to hot wings cafe, big wangs, hooters, and other chains. The atomic sauce seemed like it was rubbed on and not coated like at other places. There was no bleu cheese or ranch dressing with the wings for me to dip :-(, no carrots or celery, no ketchup for my limp ass fries that were at least seasoned well. I know wing stop has about 9 diff sauces for the wings but get the basics down 1st peeps. Maybe they should use frank's redhot sauce http://www.franksredhot.com/recipe/franks/products_b.jsp", "business_id": "y-NRJJGpCoXGibr1WhGOXA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-08-28", "type": "review"}
