The products that they have are great, a selection that you would expect at a little boutique in NYC. I have found gifts for my mom that I can'f find anywhere else! I have also gotten waxing done here and they are really professional and do a great job. I would highly recommend Jessica, one of the people who do waxing. It is a little bit of a splurge but well worth it!", "business_id": "5lqgFU8RMAysylpIShCvQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-27", "type": "review"}
