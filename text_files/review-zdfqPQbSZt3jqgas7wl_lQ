Don't get me wrong, I can't dub Koja anywhere near the best place place for Korean/Japanese food, especially when its so close to Koreana. But one has to marvel over a food truck that has the capability of delivering things like bul go ki and kimchee so quickly with a smile. Grant it the quality is somewhat what you would expect from a truck, and oftentimes the portions tend to contain too much rice for my blood. But the taste, spice, and reasonable price for what your getting is all in the right place.  If you're looking for a solid Asian influenced spot in the area then definitely go elsewhere. but if you're looking for a quick and sufficiently priced lunch that offers up something completely different than all of the other options, then Koja is the spot for you!", "business_id": "fsqlE7jhO64Q62VDI_uRFQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-18", "type": "review"}
