The best Thai I've had in the Boston area. If you like Vietnamese-style fresh summer rolls (i.e. not fried), ask for them. I don't think they're technically on the menu, but they'll make them anyway. The drunken noodles, street urchin basil, and shrimp emerald are my favorite dishes. Pineapple fried rice and mango chicken curry are also to be recommended there. The place is cozy and intimate. Perfect for a date. Unfortunately they haven't gotten a liquor license yet.", "business_id": "aRKDmJRynUacchS2_3yFKQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-03-22", "type": "review"}
