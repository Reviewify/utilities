I normally just go straight to the back of the parking lot, because it is insanely difficult to find a parking spot elsewhere. Overall, the service is very fast and I have never had to wait very long for a drink. It's not the best place to study, because the seats are always taken. Staff is also always been friendly to me.", "business_id": "On0cNw-upBlzvkFff50WMQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-22", "type": "review"}
