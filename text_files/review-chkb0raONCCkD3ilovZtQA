I met with Irma and she was very nice and is an excellent trainer. The rates are reasonable for the level of quality and for the environment. Each time I have gone to the gym, I feel comfortable and I am able to really focus on my workout. Being in that type of environment makes me want to exercise!", "type": "review", "business_id": "g1ZgmgEo20s4kLMDtXuG5Q"}
