After eating here, I get a complimentary lip gloss because of all the oil from the pasta. I've tried a lot of different pastas here, and I think the one that is the least heavy is the Pomodoro. It's plain, but it's delicious, and it doesn't make me feel like dying afterwards. Great garlic bread! If you take it to go, eat your garlic bread before it gets soggy in the to go box :(. Calzones are also HUGE. I would probably gain two pounds if I finished one by myself.\n\nConvenient location. Nice prices and serving sizes. Difficult to find seating inside for big groups.\n\nQUICK STORY: I brought my friend, who was a prospective student, to Gypsy's. He was in the process of eating his pasta when a homeless man came up to our table, grabbed his plate, and walked off to a corner to eat it... A worker noticed this and took the plate right away, but this angered the homeless man who threw his fork at the worker and yelled something O_O. Yeah. Great welcoming experience for my friend. He's still came to Cal for college though!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ"}
