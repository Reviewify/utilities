They lack a variety of clothing and most of the stuff is pretty boring. I like that they carry Tory Burch, but I can order that online and usually at a cheaper price. Coverings marks up some of their brands that you can find right across the street for about half the price. There staff is comprised of dense, somewhat snobby girls that believe they have a great knowledge of fashion. I do not know if they are still under the same owner and manager, but they used to have a manager that acted as though she was a member of the royal family or something. I gave this store multiple chances but now I won't even step foot in there. SLO has some much better boutiques minus the snobby attitudes and dull clothing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FORTQbbyBeYUMyF2ZnFgzg"}
