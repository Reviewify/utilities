Very good food, great service, and warm atmosphere. The flavors are very rich and delightful. As soon as you sit down, they bring you yummy treats to taste (crunchy thin/pancake-like items with a few unique sauces to try). Very good experience.", "business_id": "9hjuKkPO0LryqAq1xSfpuA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-23", "type": "review"}
