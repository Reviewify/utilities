Just be prepared for a massive menu - four pages including daily specials, weekend specials, and the regular menu. I had the chicken chorizo, black bean scramble topped with eggs. It was delicious and funky. My buddy had just a straight forward omelet, which he also enjoyed. It was Cafe Luna's ability to deliver fantastic renditions of both a classic dish and something a bit different that managed to elevate them from 4 to 5 stars.", "business_id": "bul_5Ahk_QYLUAJ4Od27jg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-31", "type": "review"}
