The owners are professional, friendly, and above all else, driven to provide the most sanitary, safe, and pleasant piercing experience possible. I've had a few piercings done at Stiehl's, and they have also helped me increase the gauge on one piercing and unscrew a stubborn barbell.  Their prices are reasonable for the services they offer.  Your health and safety are worth the price! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a new piercing!", "business_id": "nIpIyaguICzAM286c9iwcQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-31", "type": "review"}
