The owners are professional, friendly, and above all else, driven to provide the most sanitary, safe, and pleasant piercing experience possible.\n\nI've had a few piercings done at Stiehl's, and they have also helped me increase the gauge on one piercing and unscrew a stubborn barbell.  Their prices are reasonable for the services they offer.  Your health and safety are worth the price!\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a new piercing!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nIpIyaguICzAM286c9iwcQ"}
