I went with a few friends who were visiting for the weekend.  The decor was nice, service was good, and the food was amazing. \n\nI noticed that it's a pretty small space so I wouldn't go with more than four people without a reservation on a weekend.  It's great for a dinner for two or to catch up with a friend, it's quiet enough to talk to the people around you without having to raise your voice.  Now to the food!  \n\nThe Panang is flavorful, creamy and amazing.  You have to try really hard to mess up curry, but only a few places can be as good as this.  The portions were hearty and  had just the right amount of veggies and protein.  We also order the Massamun curry, a tamarind curry with potatoes and carrots - comfort food with a touch of spice, delicious!  This place rocks as far as curry goes, so definitely give it a try.  My friend also ordered the creatively named Pad Z U, their take on the traditional Pad See Ew dish.  The flavors were bold, but I thought there might have been too much soy sauce in it.  The noodles were also thinner than what flat noodles are supposed to be, but I think that's an Atlanta thing.  I haven't been able to find a Thai place with the thick noodles that I crave.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try the Pad Thai, but I will definitely be back.  I'm happy with the first time and as the 4-star indicates, I am a fan!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mFw45WXkOMByq4k2op0NIw"}
