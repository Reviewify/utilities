More directly - I love their red velvet cupcakes. I really like other flavors, but these are sooo good. My all-time favorite frosting is cream cheese frosting and the red velvet cake is always so moist. Other good ones are the peanut butter chocolate ones. It's like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup morphed into cake. Yum.\n\nI've tasted cupcakes from various places around the Bay Area. Sprinkles has the best red velvet ones hands down. No competition at all. \n\nI have loved cupcakes since I was a kid. So long before the more recent cupcake fad. I always wanted cupcakes at my birthday. But unless Mom made them - you could never find them except those awful grocery store kind with the pure sugar thick frosting.  These are so not those :)  Plus they make really cute ones for various holidays. \n\nI have only ever been to the Sprinkles location in Palo Alto. Every single time I have been there - weekdays, weekends, mornings, afternoons and evenings, there is a line out the door. Location really is key. I think they are a great fit for Stanford.\n\nEvery time I have gone, no matter how busy, the staff are always so friendly and fast. Very much appreciated.\n\nThe only suggestion I would have is mini-cupcakes. I would buy those every time.\n\nThey also have pupcakes. They don't call them this (I think they are called cupcakes for dogs) but my doggies love them :) You can see the ingredients on their website.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw"}
