My Cal-Bear cousin took us here this weekend and I was very impressed with the large portion, cheap price, and scrumptious flavor of the food here. Had a taste of The Godfather Special which was probably the best white-sauce pasta I've ever had. I'm not a big white sauce fan so that's saying a lot! I ordered the funghi which consisted of a variety of mushrooms, linguine and smoked mozarrella. How's that for unique? The smoked mozarrella overpowered all other flavors which was I absolutely loved! For $7, you can even share a plate with your significant other which I most definitely did!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ"}
