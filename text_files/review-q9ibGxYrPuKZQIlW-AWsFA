I have fallen into a routine and get the usual Super Falafel. The Super Falafel is too amazing to pass up! It's like a Mediterranean burrito. Sit and contemplate these words. Lavash bread. Potatoes Eggplant Hummus with the crispiest falafels I've ever had. I don't mean to sound like an addict, but I crave it regularly and highly recommend it. Don't ever leave me, Sunrise Deli! Or life will lose its meaning.", "business_id": "J27yz2L8PoubYmfi_DWrSA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-11-17", "type": "review"}
