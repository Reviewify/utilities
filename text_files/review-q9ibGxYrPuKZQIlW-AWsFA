I have fallen into a routine and get the usual Super Falafel.  The Super Falafel is too amazing to pass up!\n\nIt's like a Mediterranean burrito.  Sit and contemplate these words.\nLavash bread.\nPotatoes\nEggplant\nHummus\nwith the crispiest falafels I've ever had.\n\nI don't mean to sound like an addict, but I crave it regularly and highly recommend it.\n\nDon't ever leave me, Sunrise Deli!
