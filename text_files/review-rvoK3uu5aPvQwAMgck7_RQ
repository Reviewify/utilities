Average food, terrible service...or at least it seemed like average food when I was eating it but I ended up very nauseous after.  Was lunch and not very crowded and everything took forever and could never get their attention.   I told them I was a vegetarian and asked that my bento box be made vegetarian (which would just entail leaving out the shrimp and including veggie sushi instead of cali roll - actually much cheaper for them).  Waitress said no problem, but when it came made normally and I asked them to fix it, the response was \"no, thats just the way it comes, I can't help you.\"  The food I could eat was pretty standard, nothing to write home about and made me nauseous about 20 minutes later.  Very disappointing, was looking forward to having this place close by.", "business_id": "AKfHinPZ5vdPdHRzpvSWtw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-20", "type": "review"}
