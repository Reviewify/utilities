I usually came here to buy an anniversary/Valentine's Day/just because care package for my bf in California. It's a dark chocolate paradise. Malt balls coated with dark chocolate . Dark chocolate covered graham crackers. Smooth peanut butter center coated in dark chocolate. Solid dark chocolate bite size pieces. Oreos coated with dark chocolate.  Awesome place to buy small gifts for every occasion. It also carries sugar-free candies.", "business_id": "_JJNJEzPiSq9I0pCKSQrcQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-24", "type": "review"}
