It was AMAZING. The staff was really friendly and accommodating, and the environment was really comforting. It was actually my first facial ever (!!!) so I really wasn't sure what to expect, but it was so peaceful and relaxing that I just loved it. Plus, she really paid attention to the medicinal parts and gave me a great list of products when we were done. They do a student discount, which is awesome, and the whole thing is just so convenient and easy. Big fan!", "business_id": "fz7o2gYjqxyKMfLK1jYODg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-24", "type": "review"}
