Had the gumbo which was ok, the roux wasn't as dark as I would expect. For entrees we had smothered chicken (good but I wold have preferred boneless) and fried chicken (very crunchy). The sides were pretty good (mash, French fries and collard greens). We finished with the red velvet cake which was also good. Nice dining room, although the staff were a bit slow. Not sure if they were short staffed that night.", "business_id": "4GYc1Ld8r4rGQJKz_Qp07A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-08", "type": "review"}
