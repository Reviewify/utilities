Very tasty. However, every time I go I order something different, but it always tastes kind of the same. The steak, chicken, pork, shredded beef, seafood... I mean it's great but I just can't seem to tell the difference in taste between one dish and the next. You might think \"wait Ryan, you don't go there that often! You haven't tried everything!\" Nope, the fact that it's the only Cuban restaurant within walking distance of my dorm, the only restaurant my parents like in the area, and the fact that they take Columbia flex dollars means I've literally eaten here 20+ times, ordering some different dish almost every time, and each time realizing that whatever I've gotten tastes exactly like the last thing.\n\nThat's my only gripe; there are cheap and expensive things on the menu, but if you get the 12 dollar chicken and rice, you've basically eaten everything.\n\nTo be fair, the mojitos rule.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-AQJhfna4qcxfDnCGx_yLA"}
