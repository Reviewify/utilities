I usually get the Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger(in fact I had it today!) and it definitely doesn't disappoint. It is pretty well price, coming out to like 6 to 8 bucks for a meal. The steak sandwich is also extremely well made, when I first got it I thought to myself: \"I finally have a sandwich that looks like the ones they make to take a picture for menus :P\" Their breakfast burritos are definitely a must-have. It is so RIDICULOUSLY filling and tasty, every bite was a surprise, a damn good one at that. Olympian Burger rocks and more SC students should check it out, it definitely beats McDonalds and the other fast food places.", "business_id": "sAf2xtvoAzDAyWq3YO11Cg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-28", "type": "review"}
