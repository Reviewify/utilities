For a tea with extra boba, it comes out to $4.01, which is cheaper than the bubble tea at Leisure Station (they are stingy with their boba there). The variety is great (favorites at lychee and raspberry) and the mochi ice cream cakes are delicious. There isn't a lot of space to sit but it doesn't really matter since the yard is across the street and the river is down the street. Lots of places to sit! The only thing that I don't like is that they only take cash, but it's not a big deal.", "business_id": "ch1ercqwoNLpQLxpTb90KQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}
