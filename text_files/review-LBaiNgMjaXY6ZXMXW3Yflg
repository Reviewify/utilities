The smell of the place is enough to draw a crowd from miles. With delicious and often experimental flavors there is always something new to try. The price is right too. The only SMALL complaint I have is that the place is a little run down inside. It's kind of dirty and small.\n\nTry the sweet cream-- it will change your life. Highly recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hz1F5uruPe1kCsf5PIA6Sg"}
