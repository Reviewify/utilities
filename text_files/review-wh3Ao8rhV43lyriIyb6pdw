Tons of local farms and producers with an endless variety of products. If you want lunch, there are tons of stands with fresh and yummy food for you. If you want art, they have that too. Fresh produce, it's everywhere (and mostly organic). Looking for some wine, yep that's there. Cheese fiend, you won't be disappointed. Fresh baked goods, you betcha with yummy bread galore. Most places have very reasonable prices and it's all extremely fresh! I always love speaking to the people who grow the food I eat. It allows you to have much more of a connection to your food.  I love the enclosed Pavillion and how it's right on the water. It's a beautiful market and by far the best I have ever been to. If you are ever in the area this is a must visit! Better than any supermarket could ever dream of being.", "business_id": "pzXYxXZP6Tx-fwQDY4TVuw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-14", "type": "review"}
