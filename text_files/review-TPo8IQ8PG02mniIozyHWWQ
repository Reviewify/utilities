I followed her here from her old job at Forte (another salon in the Village). Ashley is the best! Her cuts are so cheap too. I've got thin, very slow growing, straight hair, so I'm always afraid of getting a bad haircut as I have to live with it for almost the next 6 months. With Ashley, however, I'm never nervous. She gives me such good cuts that I haven't needed to touch a blow dryer in ages...my hair just looks perfect right out of the shower!", "business_id": "L6OpSiSJLgP6Jn7zJa_ZUg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-11", "type": "review"}
