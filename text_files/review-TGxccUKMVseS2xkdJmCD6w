The color in sections is mottled and splotched.  This extends beyond individual boards, so it is not a matter of wood grain.  Some corners were left unvarnished and they had to come back to fix some black marks in one area after I saw the problem.  I saved a small amount of money over the firm that was recommended by a friend and has a good reputation.  I made a bad call.    I will probably have to have someone else come back to \"repair\" the sections that look really bad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7zGfdHgb1PlbbFCxHe4RkA"}
