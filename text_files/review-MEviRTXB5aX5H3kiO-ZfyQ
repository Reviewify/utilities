My friend and I both ordered the 'Thursday night special' (again)- this time with much better results. The burgers came out exactly as described and were cooked to perfection!\n\nThe only snafu was that the kitchen staff STILL mixed up the sauces on the burgers!! Frustrating when you only notice AFTER you have eaten a Greek themed burger with pesto sauce, only to discover Tatziki in front of the next burger down (which is an  Asian themed burger) , and the NEXT burger down has kung pao sauce in front of it!!! We told the waitress who promised to look into it, she came back minutes later confirming that she saw other burgers going out with similar sauce mix-ups, and that she would inform the manager. The manger  (Mary?) came over and apologized and was VERY nice, unlike the manager that I experienced last time. We laughed about it and finished the rest of our food. \n\nThankfully the burgers were so delicious the sauce mix-up did not hinder our enjoyment of the meal. Thanks to the friendly service, my friends pledged that they would be coming back and bring MORE friends to try the delicious Thursday night special. \n\nNote to Chef:\n\n*Dear Chef, \nPlease pay more attention when plating food that is paired with other items on the dish! The details are what make the Thursday special, well, special. Lucky for you, you make a damn delicious burger. Thank you. \n\nsincerely, \nfull bellied Anne *", "type": "review", "business_id": "MAW0cVbtqZEoXVESDkVDFQ"}
