I got a fat-free fro-yo or ice cream, but it tasted like it was SO FREAKING FULL OF DELICIOUS FAT, it was awesome for that alone. A small was easily over 1 cup, so the $3 price tag (after tax) was cool with me. But I'd rather pay a little less and get a lot less. That was seriously a lot of ice cream for a \"small\". Valiantly, I managed to polish it off though.\nSo the flavor swirl thing means the soft serve itself is vanilla, but the outside swirls are coated in some magical (chemicalicious) syurp. I had butter pecan soft serve. I can't even tell you how cool it was to have fat-free ice cream that was BUTTER FREAKING PECAN. So buttery & nutty. At least on the outside. Once the swirl is gone, you're just left with vanilla. It's not perfect, but hey. Not too bad, either.\n\nI don't think that I can ever rate soft serve ice cream anything less than 4 stars because it's always such a good time. The ice cream has to be REALLY bad, or the service godawful for it to be anything less.\n\nOh, but boo on Yelp, because when we tried to check in it said we were too far away to check in. When we were RIGHT IN FREAKING FRONT OF GUPTILLS. Crazy thought, but it might be nice to see who's already checked in when you're meeting other Yelpers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wbpbaWBfU54JbjLIDwERQA"}
