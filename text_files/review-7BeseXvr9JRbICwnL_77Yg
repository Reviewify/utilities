The place looked a lot bigger and nicer from the inside. Great for large groups. On this Wed night, it was mostly couples and two large groups. We were pretty hungry so we ordered the soup and salad plus a pasta dish for myself and the fiance. Everything tasted great although I would've liked less oil in the pasta. I ordered the spinach pasta dish. My fiance ordered something that was mostly meat and mushrooms. We didn't realize it was like a meat lover's pasta. I think I filled myself up with salad, soup and bread so I only finished half of my pasta. I'll definitely have to go back again. They have an extensive menu. I would even just go back for coffee (great old-school coffee machine that we have to try one day just to see it work) and the bread. I also want to try the gelato which they state they make every day. The bread was the highlight! It was already topped with tomato sauce so I didn't use the roasted red pepper sauce. I did dip it into my soup and the balsamic vinegar. I also notice the pace of when people bring dishes. It was good. I never noticed we weren't being served. Just enough time to enjoy each other's company and food. Great place I highly recommend.", "business_id": "WW1OGeUifaMsDIwphitvUg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-28", "type": "review"}
