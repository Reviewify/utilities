And we SAW it sitting on counter AND our waitress had like maybe 3 tables total to handle. Fail. \n\nThen it took us god knows how long to get the actual bill. \n\nFood is average. Expensive for the quality they gave us. \n\nOh, and they remodeled. It looks a little nicer but doesn't compensate for their horrible service and high prices.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sxIPX4ZAipVl3ZCkkqXqZw"}
