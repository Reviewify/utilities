Ok, your food is good -- juicy burgers, sweet potato fries with flake sea salt especially -- but so mismatched from the decor. Most of the menu, while a good idea, is executed at a lukewarm level. What about tapas?  Night vibe? Slinky, chic, a place where you can tuck away in a plush booth and sip drinks with your S.O. and listen to any variety of music (there's a great world music DJ whose name I've forgotten, and the Carlos de Leon Band plays here on occasion). Even during the day -- a beautiful lazy Saturday afternoon hangout, especially in the warm weather when they put out the patio tables and open up all the drapes to soak in the afternoon sun. Mmm. Service? You've got to be kidding me. Unfortunately, Providence must have rounded up all the eye-rollers in the area and hired them to work here. Occasionally have contemplated throwing something to get my server's attention for slow food/no food/refills/check. It's got to be a management thing, and really, it will bring the place to its knees if not addressed. Here's the clincher: I keep coming back! Why? You're so close to Craftland, Farmstead, the Black Rep and all hip things downtown. It's so easy to duck in for a coffee or lunch, and every time, I'm hoping for that good service I know a place like yours is capable of. But most times, I'm disappointed. Get it together Tazza! We could work so well together!", "business_id": "hmz3GErbZNi4wBvj5lkWiw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-01-06", "type": "review"}
