I flipped my MacBook Pro -- it did a triple gainer and landed on the corner where the hard drive is, and I lost a month's worth of work since my last backup (I know, I know). The Apple Store in Holyoke told me the HD was fubar and they would replace it and take the busted one - no data recovery - and it would take some days to accomplish. But Shawn at left-click replaced my hard drive same day, recovered most of my data and all the critical files I needed to keep working (interview recordings I could not reproduce, et cetera), and had me up and rolling for very reasonable dollars with time to spare to make my deadlines. If you're a mainstream shopper, sure, other places may have more stuff on the rack or cheaper prices. But if you live off your Mac, and you need flexible top-drawer professional tech support at short notice and inside a budget, left click are your friend in need. (My wife also liked the window-shopping in the rest of the building, and there's ice cream, coffee, good eats, bookstore, fashions, toys, furniture, etc. while you're waiting for whatever you may be waiting for, and all kinds of funky shopping and dining and music et cetera up and down the street from that, street buskers, strolling folk to ogle, whole lively downtown scene; not a generic mall experience like where the Apple Store is). Not hating on the Apple Store, I did get a new Time Capsule there (lessons learned late in life are to be savored) ... and I give Apple Store all due props for being concerned and caring folk. But five stars for left click for saving my month. Love you live, baby.", "business_id": "2NzXwHM9fQRwk9_1SF-9eQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-06", "type": "review"}
