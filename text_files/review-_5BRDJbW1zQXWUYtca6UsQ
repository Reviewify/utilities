Also, they have an awesome collection of minerals and meteorites and bugs and more fossils and all the awesome stuff that nerdy people would like.  You could definitely spend an afternoon at this place and never get bored.   One highlights about this museum that must be mentioned is that it's not crowded.  Weekends at the MFA or MoS can be hectic at best.  I was here on a Saturday and the crowds were minimal and there weren't any screaming children running around like maniacs.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an offbeat afternoon trip if it's too cold to be outside.  Definitely check out the fossil room!", "business_id": "MTGPiWQ0QS5IGjbBmZwTZQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-03-11", "type": "review"}
