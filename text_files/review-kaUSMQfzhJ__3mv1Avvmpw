Sangam was decent, but Mehlak is definitely at least a whole star above. What's funny is they're just 2 stores down the street, haha talk about competition.  The Indian buffet is great, was only 7.99. Although they had pretty limited dished, the naan and the bread is really good. The desserts are okay, but the Chicken tandoori and the other meat dishes were great. Impressed overall.  Just make sure you wear something you don't mind getting dirty (in case you spill curry or something, it never comes off) and mind getting smelly (I smelled like Indian food all day).", "business_id": "oidBvZouxEal1NWe5ARrVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-17", "type": "review"}
