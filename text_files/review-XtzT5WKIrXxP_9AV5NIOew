Its not quite as good as the ones in Chinatown but it enjoyable. \n\nThe fruit smoothies with boba are my fav. They have a great variety of flavors and types of tea to choose from which I love. The staff is friendly and the service is pretty quick. They are a little pricey and the boba can be inconsistant but when its good its really good.\n\nOverall a good but not great place for bubble tea.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ch1ercqwoNLpQLxpTb90KQ"}
