We also got the lemon pepper wings which were ok but not any that I would order again. Its a takeout place but they have tables if you order in similar to the NY pizza joint. Service was friendly and they had my order ready as soon as I came in to pick it up.", "business_id": "FH59gBe6Ji_O0UKFwXnlHQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-23", "type": "review"}
