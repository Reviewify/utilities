The lamb dish was served with a greek salad, fresh hummus, and pita bread, but the most fantastic thing about the dish was of course the lamb.  The lamb was cooked to medium and had the perfect amount of cumin.\n\nThe service was good, the ambience is good, the food is great.  The quality is worth the price, but the quantity is lacking quite a bit.\n\nI'll put a full review of this on my blog since it's a bit too much to put on here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c8Fu2uP7pg4GcqjlSlu4tA"}
