This place is fun and the food is soooooo good, we had the two tier appetizer which is - we'll just look at the menu and you'll see for yourself. The Stone Crab was so good we ordered extra with our dinner, I had to Sea Bass, oh so tender and my wife had the Cioppono. We were both very pleased. We were Rosa's guest, she really made it fun and for first timers took the guess work out of our celebration night. They had live music, which really adds to our enjoyable evening at Turluck's.
