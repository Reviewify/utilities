The pancakes and crepes were soooo good! The huevos rancheros were bad! The eggs runny and the beans and rice didn't have much flavor. We ordered an extra side of bacon and chicken and both were really good. The lime margarita tasted like water and the strawberry margarita tasted like cough syrup! Yuck!! The chips and guacamole were good. The sundeck seating area was charming.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BOCJ5g4q1RhP8wikwwr3Ow"}
