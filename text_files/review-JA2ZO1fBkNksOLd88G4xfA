The sandwiches are pretty big, and comes with a banana too. I like how there is one section for all the coffees, and one for all the foods. Maybe there are more sections, but I forgot...til next time I come down to UCLA.\n\nOh yeah, just to mention.. I don't attend UCLA as a student. Just a visitor :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKs40LPiZH9mDGixhfnvQA"}
