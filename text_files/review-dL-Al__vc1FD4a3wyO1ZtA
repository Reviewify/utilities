The rooms are somewhat like little condos. It's a shame that it wasn't built right next to the beach, I would probably give 5 stars if it were. The parking scenario is a little wrong if you ask me because they only offer valet which costs like $25 a day I believe. Overall I recommend this hotel for it's appeal to the eye and guests privacy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zjDwn8LynUzPTeuEkPbRcg"}
