I've experienced better.\" That about sums it up. I got the crab cake sandwich and my partner in crime got the adult grilled cheese. We came in for a quick lunch and it did its job, but sadly, I just don't remember much about the actual food except it was decent. Okay. I've sat here for 15 minutes looking at the screen, trying to come up with something witty or informative. I've got nothing for you. It wasn't bad food, the service was fine, but I just can't come up with a memorable thing to say about it... Go if you are looking for standard American fare with decent service in UCity.", "business_id": "pW5DXTpKnw3y0fopipbJVg", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-22", "type": "review"}
