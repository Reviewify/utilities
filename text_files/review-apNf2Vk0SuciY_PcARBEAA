(oh, and they gave me a pint glass with a chipped rim.) i'd come back here if invited, since it did have nice atmosphere (sort of dark and smoldering with brick and wood) and i thought it was cute the way the single-person restrooms were just labeled \"bathroom\" and \"bathroom.\" and i'd give a more traditional pizza a try; the portabella mushroom one sounded good. $15 for our \"large\" pizza, which served two of us okay but i was glad we went to finale later for dessert, as the thin crust isn't especially filling.", "business_id": "M487o17d25K9Jnrf-bKFQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-25", "type": "review"}
