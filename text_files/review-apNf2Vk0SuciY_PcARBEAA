I like thin crust pizza, but Emma's in Kendall Square is my fave. It's smaller, cozier, friendlier, and has way more pizza options. We got the pizza with potatoes on it, which was just kind of weird. The Emma's sweet potato pie is awesome, though, so I was expecting something more like that. This pie was sauceless, so it was kinda like herbed cheesey potatoes on a cracker. Also, our waiter was perfectly nice, but goofed on the one question I asked him. When picking a beer I asked \"How's the Wachusett Summer?\" and he told me he liked it. Fine. I said, \"It doesn't have fruit in it or anything, right?\" because Wachusett makes that blueberry beer which is GROSS. He seemed confused that I'd even ask such a question and told me no, no fruit. The beer comes and right on the label it says that it's lemon flavored. It tasted basically like Budweiser with a hint of lemon, BTW. Not horrible, and it was fine for drinking with pizza, but dang, I asked the question to avoid this scenario. (Oh, and they gave me a pint glass with a chipped rim.) I'd come back here if invited, since it did have nice atmosphere (sort of dark and smoldering with brick and wood) and I thought it was cute the way the single-person restrooms were just labeled \"Bathroom\" and \"Bathroom.\" And I'd give a more traditional pizza a try; the portabella mushroom one sounded good. $15 for our \"large\" pizza, which served two of us okay but I was glad we went to Finale later for dessert, as the thin crust isn't especially filling.", "business_id": "M487o17d25K9Jnrf-bKFQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-25", "type": "review"}
