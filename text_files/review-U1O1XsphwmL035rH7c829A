Their 1/2 Pound Burgers with LT&O along with tons of Portebella Shurums and sharp Swiss cheese with Potato Salad ROCK! \n\nBrunch is excellent also! \n\nUpon my Arrival  Feb 18 2010  I discovered that the wonderful Organic Local Restaurant HAS CLOSED NEVER TO OPEN AGAIN! \n\nThey owners say a Pannera Bread is set to open just across the way from the SMC and they felt they could not compete.\n\nThat along with the economy and some missteps doomed one of the best restaurants in \"Crunchy\" Ithaca\n\nThey do own the building the restaurant is housed in and will continue to do catering. The founders of the restaurant built the cafe from the ground up.\n\nThis is very sad as it was a very good place. \n\nThey did suffer from problems over the years. Service was  uneven taking a long time for food to arrive at times. They did not have a good manager who was able to make sure that food was prepared and delivered with as little  wait time as possible on a consistent basis.\n\nThey restaurant was  large and had lots of windows and a high ceiling.  This most likely cost a lot to heat and cool. \n\nIn addition they had four storefronts that they were trying to rent for the entire time the restaurant was open. They only filled one, while the other three sat empty. \n\nThis was a lot of lost revenue that they could have put towards the cafe. \n\nPlus the location was not as good as it could have been. Yes it was right on Elmira Road. However being so close to the road made it hard to make a left turn coming South on Elmira Road.\n\n Plus the building did not look like a restaurant so one could just pass  it by, if they did not know it was a cafe.\n\n\nIf the cafe was set back a little farther from the road with the parking in front where patrons could easily see it from the road, that would have been helpful.\n\nIf they had opened on The Commons, they would have done a much better business and still be serving wonderful food today!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9nXLjrzvjMAnj8kCL5PMEw"}
