The first thing you notice is the d\u00e9cor:  indoor seating is cozy, with an outdoor patio section, ambient lighting and nice candles on the tables (a small detail, but something I love :)    My friend had sushi rolls while I had select pieces of nigiri (salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, shrimp, and tuna caviar).  Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious!  The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality.  The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service.  The waiter was very friendly, entertaining, and came by many times to checkup on us.  The service really took the whole dining experience up a notch.    \n\nP.S.  The mojitos were great too!  Will definitely be coming back for more sushi and drinks nights.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NEVA0IYbawceL6kz5v5DAw"}
