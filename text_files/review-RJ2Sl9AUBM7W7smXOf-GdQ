But sometimes I do, anyway. \n\nAs they say, you get what you pay for. \n\nParkside runs a tight ship. The waiters seem to take pride in their work, and I really appreciate that. We've gotten the same waiter several times, and while I forget his name, the service has always been impeccable. \n\nThe specials are always something interesting (although for me, not affordable at $30+). We usually come for drinks and, while my friends might get dinner, I usually settle for a salad or an app. \n\nNot too big, not too small, with a stellar location just a stone's throw away from the river. On Waterfire nights, you can see the paper lantern luminarias hanging in the trees of the park across the street. On warm summer nights, the tables on the sidewalk outside are really nice, too. Parkside is intimate but not cramped, a perfect place for date.  \n\nThere is valet parking, but we never use it. I only tried the rotisserie chicken once; mine was dry, but  all other times my friends ordered it, it was perfect. Drinks: try the cucumber martini or the black & white cosmo.\n\nLadies, if you come in jeans, be sure to dress it up on the top half. Anything less than dressy... they won't deny you a seat, but you will feel under-dressed.\n\n[By way of sidenote... on June 30, 2011, there was a kitchen fire here that spread to other parts of the building. As of September 2011, their website says that they are still working on the rebuild and it appears they are still closed.]", "type": "review", "business_id": "1M5pHJqGLL_-t74M37uQ0Q"}
