It's the perfect cozy, dimly lit little nook to grab a pint and not have your conversation be overwhelmed by music or a noisy crowd.  And though I do love my dive bars, I don't consider Shay's to be in that realm. Great for some good beer and friendly conversation, take your date here and they're sure to swoon!", "business_id": "XlcWm3OdV1QrSPF_AwrlTQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-04", "type": "review"}
