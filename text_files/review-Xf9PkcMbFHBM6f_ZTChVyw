The parking situation is a nightmare.  I parked in the garage on the roof (on a Sunday afternoon) and there are no stairs.  You have to walk down the ramps that the cars use, which is just not safe.\n\nThe front desk staff ignored me when I checked in, I at least thought some introduction would be in order since it is the first weekend they are open.  They acted put out when I asked where the Kids' Club was. \n\nI thought the club itself would be a lot bigger.  It felt very cramped and not well laid out.  The water fountains had tepid water, which is not good when you are looking for a cool drink.  I think the location on Richmond at Sage is nicer and it isn't even a Super Sport.  It feels much more open there and the equipment is just as nice.\n\nMainly, I miss the kind workers from Greenbriar.  Hopefully I will see more friendly faces over the next week, but I am not holding my breath.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LOA5jCTX6eKENA9lsldMSw"}
