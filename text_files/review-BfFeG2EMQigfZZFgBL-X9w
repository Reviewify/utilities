Terrible place. Not horrific to earn them one star but the food simply was not good. Though in all fairness, I didn't drink their beer and it is a brewery. I tried the happy hour nachos ($7), Enchiladas and a pitcher of sangria ($15). Everything was mediocre at best. I don't know, I guess I just didn't vibe with the place. The waitress was nice though.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oIgx5AEdeBnsibH7GJc2fg"}
