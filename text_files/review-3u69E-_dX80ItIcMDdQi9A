Cream offers a wide selection of ice cream for you to mash between two warm cookies all for the cheap price of two bucks. TWO BUCKS! How can you possibly beat that?\n\nI had a scoop of the coffee almond fudge squished between two chocolate chip cookies. I'm not entirely sure what people are saying about a getting a \"huge\" scoop of ice cream because it's somewhat average... I guess it's big for 2 dollars.... Anyways, the coffee fudge ice cream is quite the delight. I wish I chose different cookies though since the chocolate chips aren't really aching to rave about.\n\nIf you get a scoop of ice cream here, you're stupid and should be smacked. Price wise, it's obvious to get the ice cream sandwich. Asian senses ftw! heheh\n\nOverall, nice customer service and tasty summer treat. Too bad I'm not much of an ice cream sandwich person or I'd declare my next home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
