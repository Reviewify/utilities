I had their gluten-free chocolate velvet cupcake and it was the best commercially produced gluten-free cake I've sampled to date (and I've tried a lot, including ones from the famous Babycakes NYC gluten-free bakery).  The crumb was moist and tender, there was a good dark chocolate flavor (with no off-taste that gluten-free baked goods can sometimes have from using alternative flours -- Sprinkles gluten-free red velvet cupcake has a strong bean taste since they use bean flours, which some people like me can taste and are averse to), and the frosting was great.  It was like a light chocolate mousse instead of the powdered-sugar bomb that commercial cupcakes' frosting usually is, and I appreciated the restraint!  I'm very picky about cake, and this was great.  Thank you Kara for providing a sweet treat for those of us that can't have gluten.  The $3.25 price tag is still hefty for someone like me who is used to home baking, but I definitely know where I will go when I have a cake-craving but don't want to make my own.", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-16", "type": "review"}
