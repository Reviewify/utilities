I've had the pot roast sandwich and the bison burger. The pot roast was a surprisingly small portion. The bun on my bison burger was a little stale. Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with Destihl is their attempt at trying to create elevated food that just come off as tacky. For instance when I split their quesadilla appetizer they proudly touted it was deconstructed. That meant the appetizer consisted of some tortillas with melted cheese and a side of so-so grilled steak. Give me a break- I've had some cleverly deconstructed items before and that was not the case here. They do a similar thing with smores (e.g. the marshmallows come pre-melted). Tacky might be a strong word but to serve things in ways that are poorly executed and actually make eating your meal less enjoyable and more complicated in an attempt to seem high-end is pretty tacky.", "business_id": "-fiUXzkxRfbHY9TKWwuptw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-03-05", "type": "review"}
