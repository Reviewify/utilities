I plunked myself on the couch and spent 3 hours there unmolested.  If I lived closer to the place, I would hang out every other day, because it is a good day place to write. The barista made my cafe mocha too sweet and the cookies were miniscule, so I don't know about the food.  The desserts in the case look decent, but nothing to really drool over.  If I go back, it will definitely be just to hang out, not because the food is crave-alicious.  The off-street parking was also pretty easy to find that day. The only drawback: you need to ask for a key for the bathroom, which is never fun, especially for those of us with OCD who don't want to touch a filthy key when there are no guarantees that any of the last 50 people have washed their hands.", "business_id": "GaTccmN78DL8hv2FRzHBVA", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-01-28", "type": "review"}
