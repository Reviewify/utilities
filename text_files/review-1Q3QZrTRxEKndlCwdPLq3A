The bar and ambiance in the restaurant are very nice. Our waiter was very helpful, but a bit too excitable. Started with the cold shellfish platter for two. Was simply OK, not spectacular. The seafood didn't seem extremely fresh. Neither of us got sick, but it just tasted like it had been sitting around for a little too long. Shared the Fleming salad next. Absolutely awful. It really irks me when restaurants allow brown lettuce to be served. At least half of the lettuce on the plate was brown. If that wasn't bad enough, it was also completely overdressed. I had the lite filet cooked medium, with a side of spinach instead of the scalloped potatoes it normally comes with because I wanted something a bit healthy. (Especially since we ordered the half and half - half onion rings and half fries as another side). Unfortunately the spinach was soaked in oil. The onion rings were good, but the fries were soggy. The steaks were just OK. They are wet aged, not dry aged. Of course the waiter tried talking up wet aged steaks over dry aged, but I know better. There are many restaurants in Providence that are far better, so I won't be returning.", "business_id": "ezfOX2z0EOFH6UOQyrkRpA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-10", "type": "review"}
