The service is smooth, their helpings are generous, and yes! The Manager is a cool guy!\n\nThe one time I went, it was the day after I submitted a payment online. The only problem with that is that I accidently submitted it twice (oops). That was a laaarge payment. I came to pay for my yummy salad and my card got declined.\n\nThe manager just so happened to be walking by while I wondered aloud why my card wasn't getting accepted. The only thing I could possibly think of was my direct deposit failing (hey... it's happened a couple of times for those of you that are rolling your eyes). He reach over, comped my lunch and sent me out with a free salad, no questions asked, no quirked eyebrows and no funny looks. Thanks for making my payment fail less awkward/depressing awesome manager-guy at Chipotle on Kirby!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TXYNh-U2aX7I7ssX6e5kaw"}
