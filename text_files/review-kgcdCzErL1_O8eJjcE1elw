I have been to all the LPQuotidiens in LA and this is by far the worst, the best one in my opinion is in Larchmont.  This one is small and dirty...real dirty. It is my opinion that if a restaurant is dirty where you can see it then the kitchen must be filthy.  We went this past week. They had ONE waitress at 10am. Our table had been cleaned of dishes but was sticky and had a lot of dirt on there that had been on there a long, long time...ground in.  I asked the waitress if she could bring over a cloth to clean it and I think she was offended which made me think something bad could happen to my food if I pushed the clean issue.  She was not happy and swiped the table briefly as only a \"college coed with a bad attitude, worried to much about how she looks to work and with no cleaning experience\" could do.  You know, Pain Quotidien ain't cheap so a little service would be nice. Not only is the patio, the tables and chairs outside dirty and in need of a visit from a pressure washer but the interior of the restaurant is in the same shape and the bathroom was disgusting and stinky.  It ruined my food for me as I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  How hard is it to keep a restaurant clean? Stop hiring teenagers and maybe that will be a start.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rbc9eyODP68T_DFzIYuNNQ"}
