They offer a variety of cheap, filling sandwiches (I'm always full from a half-sandwich or a small or whatever they call it), which are made super quickly and usually eaten even quicker. Very friendly owners, too.\n\nMy only beef is that they don't toast most of the sandwiches (only hot specialty ones, which are a bit extra). But I'd say that about a third of the time I visit the (totally awesome) UV Food Court, I eat here (with one third going to the Indian place, and the rest split between Mongo Fresh, the Mexican place, the Greek place, and, when I can afford it, Manna's.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "qDdIQzhX04n1rlthiY3A8w"}
