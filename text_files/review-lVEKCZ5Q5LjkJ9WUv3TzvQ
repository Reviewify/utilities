At first sight, it looked really good.   It kinda went downhill from there. I'm a salad person, but I literally felt like I was eating raw, bland grass.  Adding Nutella made it more bearable, but I had to ask for the Nutella.  It wasn't filling, and I was hungry again an hour late. I got to sample my friend's soup, which tasted better.  Their items seem to be a hit-or-miss.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try their baked goods, but probably not their entrees.", "business_id": "nbYDvcIjQf5bioEefypkYQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-15", "type": "review"}
