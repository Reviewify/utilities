This restaurant makes you feel like you are on a very special romantic date. The indoor seating is very limited and not very chic. The location is very good, right at the beginning of downtown San Luis Obispo, close to the movie theater-- dinner and a movie? The food here is good, but not the best I have ever tasted. I feel like Buona Tavola can best be compared to Giuseppe's, another Italian spot in San Luis Obispo, just down the road. The food at Buona Tavola is good, but doesn't take time to develop the flavors of their sauces. The seafood pasta was the best dish I have had here. The other options weren't very memorable. The prices are also a bit high for the amount and quality of food but they compare adequately with those of Giuseppe's so it's understandable. Great for a date-- order a bottle of wine, munch on the bread and dip and then maybe order a dessert! Just enjoy the beautiful garden.", "business_id": "fy8ssAoDOOtg3Y2iqfMHSQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-13", "type": "review"}
