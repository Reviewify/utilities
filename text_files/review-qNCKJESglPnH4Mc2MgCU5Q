I didn't know what to choose or what would go good with what because the menus all looked packed and overwhelming.  But i was able to decide... and like Coldstone (except this was frozen yogurt), I didn't like how it got all gooey.  I don't like liquid, melting textures for smoothies, ice cream, frozen yogurt... so I usually eat those things before they tend to melt.  Anyways, the service was okay.  It's very loud inside so they're like yelling at you when taking your order.  I wasn't that impressed with the final outcome of my yogurt.  I don't know if I'll even order something from there again.  Guess I like Pinkberry and Yogurtland the best.\nBTW, the place is tiny... so the place truly does get packed during the night.  You'll see a line going out the door.  Most of their customers are locals who have been going there for years.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G9ikQvepVd9Etucc65lc0Q"}
