This golden spoon is conveniently located inside of Ralphs, which to me is a great way to get fat!! you walk into Ralph's, some frozen yogurt, then go grocery shopping, and then after this is done you go home and eat the food you just bought!! hehe I love it. My favorite thing to get is the reese's peanut butter cup mixed with just chocolate, and I'm in heaven.", "business_id": "Z9-qY3zLrN9J--JrIBo7Zw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-22", "type": "review"}
