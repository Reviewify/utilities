Well, mostly I'm really excited by how awesome the brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes are that come with it. The other dishes are to be expected by a reasonably good priced sushi place. It's nothing to write home about but good if you want some okay priced sushi.\n\nThat said, the service was pretty bad. I've been there 3-4 times and it's pretty consistently pretty bad. If you can ignore that, then you'll enjoy it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg"}
