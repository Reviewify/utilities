I honestly don't know why some people have a problem with it.  I everyday took the red-line to Harvard Square at one point of my life, and always heard the Kendall/MIT stop and never checked it out.  Finally one day I decided to and it was beautiful.  During the day its quite busy, but that changes later in the evening.  Decent restaurants and cool tech companies.  Not every place in Cambridge has to be \"artsy\" or eclectic.  Kendall is Kendall and has its pros.  Last time I was in Kendall I was staying at the Marriott which is right across from the T stop.  I was there on a Sunday and it was EMPTY!  I walked from Main Street to Mass Ave and encountered only several people.  But not to give it a fair shot or not as many stars because its not artsy is crazy.  If everything became the same then we would complain how they're all alike with no personality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JP53J40Zkp5SMpCEsa4P5Q"}
