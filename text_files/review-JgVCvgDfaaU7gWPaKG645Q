It's a wonder why I haven't found this place before, when it comes to chicken wings; it can be done many different ways, especially fried chicken. Some places can have too much batter, some not enough seasoning and some just fail. That doesn't fail here, is the nice use of Panko breadcrumbs, which leaves a nice touch of crunch and and combined with whatever seasonings they have been using; makes you desire for more. The meat is juicy and cooked just right; there isn't anything \"BBQ\" about it; except it means \"Best of the Best Quality\" and they make it clear that this chain isn't anything like the chains which we are used to. This is the quintessential Asian restaurant with a western theme. And there's the Soju, the luscious yummy alcoholic drink, which pretty much tastes like it was paired just right for the late night chicken run. I would recommend this place anytime of the day or night, it's worth visiting; clean, filled with Asian music, and when it comes down to it, just good food. Try it, and I'm sure you will have a new appreciation of what fried chicken might be.", "business_id": "8Mw2PtzFK1YioyzQE1wFxg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-31", "type": "review"}
