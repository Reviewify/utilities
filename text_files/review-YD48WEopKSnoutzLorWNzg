Nothing outstanding there, but totally servicable.\n\nThe chairs are wobbly because they only have three legs, and are pretty uncomfortable, almost as though they were trying to inspire you to not stay very long, but that's just a theory. The upstairs tables are too high for comfort on a laptop, and the bottoms are too low to fit your knees if you want to sit up close.\n\nThe (white) wall downstairs was peppered with gnats/flies of some sort that kept flying into my face. That was terribly annoying and kind of gross. \n\nThe music was also pretty loud and intrusive into my headspace. For the music, the flies, and the bad chairs, I am deducting 1 star apiece, but the space really probably deserves 3 or 4 stars. The 3.5 rating here on yelp seems pretty fair.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PgBAgj4Iw1aZcBfRw4_ymA"}
