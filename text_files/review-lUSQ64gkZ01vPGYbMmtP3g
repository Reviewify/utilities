Not always my favorite stuff, but was always fun and introduced you to new (or old!) music. My faves are the morning shows--Breakfast of Champions (alternative \"college radio\" tunes) and Late Risers Club (punk, old and new!). These shows will keep you happy from 8a 'til noon. We also used to really like Tonto's Fury, which came on in the late afternoon one day a week. This was a show that played only stuff by Native American artists. It's these kinds of shows that expose you to things you definitely wouldn't find on commercial radio, and what makes me love WMBR. Just wish their signal was a bit stronger so I could get it at home!", "business_id": "9MdULwol5kEHJeeeY8UnGg", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-06", "type": "review"}
