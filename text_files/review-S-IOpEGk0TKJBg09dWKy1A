Loved the service (Carmine, you rock)  I really had a wonderful time here with my honey during happy hour.  Our waiter was very attentive. He started by telling us about the happy hour specials. We indicated we were wine drinkers and he described the wines that were on the $6/glass happy hour menu. It was a good selection. I had one from there and then one from the regular wine list.  Then on to the food.  We ordered the Magnolia chicken salad. It had apples, red grapes, candied walnuts and a light blue cheese vinaigrette. I loved this salad.  Next we had the turkey burger. It was really tasty. With a nice home made thousand island dressing and topped with avocado.  Then our fab waiter showed up with a bowl of mac n cheese that he said was a mistake. OMG sooo good. My intention was to bring it home for the kids, but I accidentally ate it all.  To end the evening we had Sweet Caroline's White Chocolate Berrycake. A beautiful dessert that also tasted beautiful.", "business_id": "WbghvrJETTvt9p7nPcfjAQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-29", "type": "review"}
