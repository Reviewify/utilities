Ignore the Princeton pretentiousness and come here for the very fresh and very tasty seafood.  I cannot stress enough how fresh the seafood is. The raw bar selections are varied and taste great. Seafood dishes range from the classics (Fish & Chips, Bouillabaisse) to the interesting (Skate sauteed in lemon, oil & capers). It's not crazy or too strange.  Food is simply cooked and refreshing. The dessert menu is amazing! Wait staff is pleasant & friendly. Nonetheless, during the warm temp months, be prepared for a very long wait. Make reservations! You will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "3g-OXwOHASK8bCuInOfNKg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}
