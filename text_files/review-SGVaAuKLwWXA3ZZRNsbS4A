I often bring guests from out of town here. There is often a wait, especially on weekend evenings. But, the host will be sure to share the current selection of beers with you and offer to bring one out while you wait. My friends and I put Emma's on our top ten list of restaurants that need to expand to a larger location. OK, so now about the pizza. Basically, its just really good. The pizzas are thin crust, like you get in Italy not New York. The ingredients are all really fresh. The best part is the suggested combinations. They have come up with some of the most interesting, tasty combinations of pizza toppings I have ever experienced. There are plenty of meaty options. But, generally I go for the vegetarian pizzas because they are so friggin' good. Definitely check this place out.", "business_id": "7bYE2n75faWu_OjzxD0l0w", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-07-14", "type": "review"}
