My paycheck can't take it anymore. Even if I had Billy Gates' money, I'd probably run out before I found all the books I wanted. And wait! There's more! Art supplies, Husky memorabilia to adorn your walls and show your support (ok. That's a bit of a stretch), a plethora of posters and, yes, tons of textbooks! National and international authors have book signings and talks here and there is even an espresso bar! What more could a starving student want? Besides more money. Get real. Support an independent bookseller and buy a book or two. Wander around and dream a little about the next bundle of books you're going to buy or write.", "business_id": "DBb5klG44ftEqLiK0bobJA", "stars": 5, "date": "2005-07-30", "type": "review"}
