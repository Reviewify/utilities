Keep me away from this place!  My paycheck can't take it anymore. Even if I had Billy Gates' money, I'd probably run out before I found all the books I wanted.  \r\nAnd wait! There's more!  Art supplies, Husky memorabilia to adorn your walls and show your support (ok. That's a bit of a stretch),  a plethora of posters and, yes, tons of textbooks!   National and international authors have book signings and talks here and there is even an espresso bar! \r\nWhat more could a starving student want?  Besides more money. Get real. \r\nSupport an independent bookseller and buy a book or two. \r\nWander around and dream a little about the next bundle of books you're going to buy or write.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DBb5klG44ftEqLiK0bobJA"}
