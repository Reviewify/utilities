Not the best I've had but I have definitely had a lot worse here in Boston. So why does Le's get 4 stars instead of just 3 (for having adequate Pho)? Three reasons: 1. Price was affordable. 2. Service was great. Let's face it, when you're in a pho restaurant, you don't expect the greatest \"corporate\" experience. Le's is the exception. There was always a server around if I needed anything but they weren't overbearing. Empty dishes were never left on the table for too long and water was always filled. 3. THEY HAVE BUBBLE TEA! Yes, this is capitalized to show how excited I was to drink bubble tea with my pho. They don't just have bubble tea, they have the BEST bubble tea I've had here in Boston. Even if you don't want pho, come here to get a bubble tea rather than to Boston Tea Stop. I've gotten a Strawberry Bubble Tea at both places and Le's is hands down much better. They actually use real fruit rather than that sickly sweet syrup at Boston Tea Stop. Conclusion: Go to Le's for good pho, great service, and bubble tea!", "business_id": "V7z-P1aqxkHTcKAsWA603A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-04-06", "type": "review"}
