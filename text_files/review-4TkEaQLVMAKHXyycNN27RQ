Memorabilia coves the walls, there are a lot of TV's and the food is average. We tried 5 different apps and as many entrees. Some were above average, some, like the nachos, well below average. The one thing that bothered me and maybe I have issues (ha), but I ordered the same mixed drink three times and it came in three different sized/shaped glasses. This just bothered me. Overall a typical sports bar. Our waitress was cute and bubbly so she was a good addition. It is quite large and open so I am sure it gets loud.", "business_id": "_nC2ytNxfhOoyJydlJVtlw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-15", "type": "review"}
