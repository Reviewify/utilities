I would much prefer three different sliders, but the beans just aren't cutting it for me.\n\nThis location is perfect for the zoo visiting stroller set, especially on a gorgeous day like today.  We were lucky to snag an outdoor table with a great view of the park.  The chicken and beef sliders were fresh and the rolls were outstanding.  The fries were wonderful, especially the salt.  They would be even better with malt vinegar.\n\nLooking forward to returning!", "type": "review", "business_id": "opPQiewFDpZZzmECcNMurw"}
