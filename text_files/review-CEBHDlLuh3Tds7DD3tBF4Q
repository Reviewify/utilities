Some of my friends are big fans of this place, so we decided to buy some burgers on the way to the theater - and sneak them into the movie. I ordered the grandslam burger (onion, cheddar, mushrooms, bacon) and some fries. I patiently looked forward to my burger and fries as we sat down on our seats and waited for the lights to dim. Even though the fries were soggy because of the wait and the burger was a bit squished be I was thoroughly satisfied. The burger was well cooked and tasty. Not bad for less than $9.", "business_id": "PPQgcw0WKdZ6nznkPLgX5Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-03", "type": "review"}
