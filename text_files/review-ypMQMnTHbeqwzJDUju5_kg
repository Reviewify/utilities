A seasonal custard stand.  I brought my New York friends to wait in the lines.  Then we sat at the picnic table in the parking lot and watched the electric billboard.   It has a charmingly eccentric menu that is very difficult for the newcomer to decipher.  There are only a few kinds of custard.  The lemon and the orange are exceptional.  A good deal that is poorly advertised: take home the Party Pack or Sundae Kit (the names have changed). This is the only five star food review I have posted for Champaign-Urbana.", "business_id": "BKLWat64KRYzsT2DgY6Xxg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-22", "type": "review"}
