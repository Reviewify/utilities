My flight was at 7:30. I arrived at the FlyAway at 5:15 thinking that there was a shuttle every 25-40 minutes because they did not update the website! I was pissed and started to panic!!! A taxis started circling and offered us a ride for $8 per person for 5 people so I hoped on instead. FlyAway, sucks for you!", "business_id": "t6qBeLsoKOUmUwJCTFyjuQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-01-02", "type": "review"}
