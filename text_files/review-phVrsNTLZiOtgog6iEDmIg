I had little kids once upon a time....heck, I was a little kid once upon a time. And the one thing all us little kids love about staying in hotels is jumping around on the beds. Which is what I'm listening to as I types this. The structure of this hotel must be awfully flimsy, because I can FEEL them jumping around and occasionally falling with a huge thud on the floor. I can also hear adults up there, but unfortunately, said adults aren't scolding said little kids into settling down, despite the fact that it is close to 11 pm. Maybe those parents were partying with the chaps who are drinking and telling really loud jokes outside in the parking lot, so they're too sloshed to control the springy offspring. Gosh that joke must be funny, because they sure are laughing hard. If I could hear over the very loud air conditioner, I might have heard the punchline. Given all the noise around here, maybe I should consider the loud hum of the fan as a kind of blessing in a white noise kind of way. Oh wait, I hear the telephone ringing. Not in my room though. The room upstairs. Did I mention that the walls and floors are thin? It must be the front desk calling to tell the munchkins to knock it off. That's a slight slight plus....which is why I'm awarding this review a virtual bonus star. Plus free wi-fi and breakfast get a nod. And the room was big, and appears clean, although I would prefer it not smell so overwhelmingly of bleachy cleaner. But I'd rather pay $20 or $30 more and not have so much noise.", "business_id": "uZoT_yk0iVHlXq2uJB60Sw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-25", "type": "review"}
