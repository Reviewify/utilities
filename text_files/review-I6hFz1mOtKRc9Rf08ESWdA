That always makes me happy. The spa interior is beautiful! I love the front area with the makeup counters and nail stations...I spied brie and crackers too, yum! Contrary to another review I read below the spa waiting area is not up front. I was taken to a small room off the side hallway which is similar to the waiting area at Stanford. There was a fireplace, refreshments, a warm neck pillow and a perfect foot soak with stones. I was relaxed by that point. I got the sea meets stone facial and it was great, except I never got my stone facial massage (minus one star). Every other part of it was fabulous and my co workers even commented on my glow and how \"clean\" my face looked (yeah, there's a cultural barrier with that person). For some reason, I always preferred Stanford even though I had never seen the T&C location. I love La Belle, but just can't afford to regularly include it in my personal grooming regimen...however, I will definitely return and hope they continue working with spa week.", "business_id": "CEYe2iZoOdsInxU9Mlbjcw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-18", "type": "review"}
