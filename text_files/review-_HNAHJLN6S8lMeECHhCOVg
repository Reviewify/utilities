I wish it were less expensive ($11 for each ticket; around $15 for two medium sodas and a small popcorn), but it's on par with other movie theatres. The theatre itself is really nothing special, but it's more than adequate. The film selection alone earns four stars.\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with KSC, but the parking garage now has machines so patrons can self-pay for parking with cash or credit card. This is kind of awesome because nothing kills the mood after watching an awesome, thought-provoking film than freezing one's butt off while standing in line to pay.", "type": "review", "business_id": "b2yLnFM7tqv6b2VfQNSrlA"}
