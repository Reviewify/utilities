Pizza slices for $1.50 and beer for $3, you just really can't complain. Typical pizza joint. Fun staff- everyone was friendly. Show them your yelp review for a free slice. \nFresh ingredients and they say you can even bring in your own topping if you don't see it on the menu. They fold over the crust (like stuffed crust) and are generous with the toppings.\nFYI be careful of the careless college kids and their drunk driving. I saw more then one car try to park in the front (it wasn't even a parallel parking job) and hit the car behind him when he had no one in front of him. seriously people, if you're drunk just get a cab or call a friend to pick you up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YzNr5QN_t2tbxitwcuu8EA"}
