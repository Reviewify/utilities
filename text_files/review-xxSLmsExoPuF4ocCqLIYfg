I was a little hesitant about the combination of Mexican, American, and Indian food (plus a full espresso bar), but I decided to make the trip nonetheless. My dining partner and I spent several minutes looking at the expansive menu before we each decided to get the chicken curry. We also decided to try an Aloo Paratha. The owner greeted us and took our order, and he was both extremely friendly and extremely gracious. I mentioned that we heard about this restaurant on Yelp, and he paused before earnestly thanking us for coming in. I knew we were in for a good experience. He mentioned a few other items on the menu, then we placed our order and made our way to a table. A moment later, I decided I should try the coffee, so I went back up and ordered a mocha latte. It was quite a treat, though I should have had it iced, since the curry really got me hot and bothered. Shortly thereafter, the owner made his way to our table with what I assumed would be the paratha. Instead, he set down a plate of samosas, a special appetizer on the house as a thank-you for coming in. Wow, incredible service. The food arrived, and while it was way more than we needed, everything was delicious. For a reasonable price, I got a very satisfying meal, excellent service, and an altogether pleasant and memorable experience. I really look forward to trying this place again, as I promised the owner on my way out the door.", "business_id": "1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-08", "type": "review"}
