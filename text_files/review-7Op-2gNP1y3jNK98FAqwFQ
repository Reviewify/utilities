There beer selection is average at best recommend the Sams Adams octoberfest on tap a pint for 3 dollars or any leninkugels on tap. They have daily drink specials, two dollar long islands on Thursdays, Friday yaegar shots 2 dollars. The food is your average bar food burgers, some wraps, wings, nachos, for fries have to pay 2 dollars extra. The real annoying part of this place is the food is ordered at the bar than picked up by you when the number is called. There is no hostess or waitstaff all self serve and first come first serve on tables. You could be waiting hours for a table at this place recommend you get there at 6:00pm before the late night rush!!!", "business_id": "UUsS7SrTQQ2AvvpslfrvFA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-10-06", "type": "review"}
