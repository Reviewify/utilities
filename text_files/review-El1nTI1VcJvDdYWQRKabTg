The manager was GREAT! He escorted my dad from the car, because it was a down pour. They sent a dessert on the house to celebrate! They all provided excellent service and attention. Our meal was nice, the sushi wasn't the best! The decor was beautiful and ambiance. Its a great place with a group and never seen such GREAT service in NC. The manager and staff made it a great experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VyjGdT2PxT591CRrHGM_sw"}
