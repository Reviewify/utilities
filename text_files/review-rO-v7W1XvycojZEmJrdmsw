My first impression: great atmosphere. They got music goin' on 'til midnight on weekends (though they stop the grill at about 10pm), serving your favorite beers. On weekends they stop at 1am I believe. I thought that there was only one floor, until I broke my seal (pee pee) & was told to go upstairs. There is a shuffle board & pool table along with a bunch of lounge chairs & tables which put out a very 'homey' & 'loungey' feel. It's a great place to be at, especially with their Happy Hour from 10pm-12am, where beers can be around $4. I was recommended Samuel Adams Oktoberfest - good deal. :) Anyone living on or even off-campus should give this place a visit.
