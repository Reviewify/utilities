Laid back.  AWESOME vegetarian burritos and chimichangas, good guac, and I like them Margaritas man!  Huevos rancheros is another favorite of mine.  The vegetarian food there is truly so, you don't have to ask if it's made with clam sauce, chicken broth, lard, etc.  Small place with an expanded dining room in back, and sometimes gets rather busy, but some of the best Mexican in Champaign.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_a6jhRFIgOe74U73T5B-Ww"}
