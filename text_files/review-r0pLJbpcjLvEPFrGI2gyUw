A lot of the restaurants have a dive-y vibe that I outgrew when I got rid of my blacklight posters back in college. So thank goodness for Jersey Mike's, even though it's a chain.\n\nI've been here twice with work friends and was pleasantly surprised to find the interior cheery and clean, and the sandwiches tasty. My go-to choice is the veggie sandwich with cheese, bell pepper, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and honey mustard, on wheat. The bread has a nice graininess to it and ingredients are fresh. There's not a huge ingredient selection (e.g., only one kind of cheese), but I like what they have so it's not a problem for me.\n\nBe aware, the sandwiches run large. A 'mini' is substantial.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9CQC0ILYwpmdFqhD6XfhA"}
