It's not too expensive, and has impressive Italian food for the price.  My boyfriend had some kind of weird meat dish (and I'm mostly vegetarian) and I had the amazing pasta with eggplant. Neither of us complained, which is honestly a plus. In addition, including a bottle of wine, our total bill was about 50 bucks. We both really enjoyed eating at Max Soha. Now, you could consider going downtown to an extremely expensive restaurant, but why would you want to?
