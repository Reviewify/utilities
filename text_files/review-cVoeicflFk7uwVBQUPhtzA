The downfall for the restaurant seems to be their food. Dinner: we went there on St. Patty's Day, which was awesome because as we were waiting to be seated there was an Irish bagpipe band that came into the bar area to play a couple of songs! Once we were seated, service was good, especially considering how busy they were, but the food was just average. Brunch: the hubby had the corned beef hash and was really disappointed; it was not tasty and was super greasy. I had pancakes, which you can't really mess up. Ultimately, it seems to be a good place to come get drinks.", "business_id": "yoem-KW_Jln0LqsdLwLeUQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-12-27", "type": "review"}
