The first time was a bust because I only moved a couple of feet in 45 minutes, and this was on a Thursday! Oddly enough, I went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was long but only took 20 minutes. Once getting in to Sprinkles, I was unimpressed with their customer service and wait for cupcakes, after waiting in line for so long. If you're charging $3.25 per cupcake, you need to run this ship more smoothly. I'm a baker so my my standard may be higher than some some customers'. I found that Sprinkles cupcakes were not worth the wait nor the price. To be fair, I tried a wide variety of everything they had to offer and the best were the chocolate coconut, chocolate marshmallow, and the red velvet. The most unappealing were anything involving their white cake, in which all I tasted was butter, um, and more butter. The frosting is waaaaayyyyy to sweet and the cake could use a little more sweetness. Sprinkles has a great snowball marketing approach which can be attributed to the freakishly long line that captures interest and momentum. Perhaps, that's part of the reason the wait from Thursday to Sunday decreased so much. Once you're in and try these cupcakes, you realize it's not worth the effort. This review is not to say that they're not good enough to eat but for the price and for the line and sugar-induced hallucinations, I'm not going back. I can make them better at home so I'll keep it that way.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-29", "type": "review"}
