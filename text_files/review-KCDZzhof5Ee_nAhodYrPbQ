I miss Diddy Riese Cookies, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Iced Blendeds (although we now have 3 stores in the city! YAY!), Apple Pan hamburgers, Tito's Tacos, Lawry's, Dupar's Pancakes and Woo Lae Oak Korean BBQ.  Funny how you miss the random stuff...", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
