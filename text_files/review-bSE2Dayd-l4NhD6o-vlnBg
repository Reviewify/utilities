Showed up around 2:00, so i missed the breakfasty fare that I was seeking, but hey who cares when you can have Maryland crab and corn chowder, salmon flan with creme fraiche and caviar....Mahi Mahi, with local veg and Spicy Lobster broth, Ribeye with Celery Root Mash which was off the chain!  but wait...wait...I've read this on several reviews here and they are all correct...DON'T LEAVE UNLESS YOU HAVE EATEN THE CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING!  Oh they make their own ice cream I was told...and it was amazing.  Local Ingredients, you can taste the freshness....Drinks were a little weak, so I deducted a star for that..but hey go here you won't be disappointed....It is a little pricey for brunch but you only live once..if you want cheap breakfast go to zoes....I wish I would have taken some pics....", "business_id": "1iY5q6spBS_DNWyemY829A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-01", "type": "review"}
