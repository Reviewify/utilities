When I'm around school, I always get a Jasmine Milk Tea. It's just an all time favorite of mine. I think the password is \"LosAngeles\" now, but I'm quite sure.  Sometimes the line gets long and it gets super hot, but it's worth it. I never buy my drinks and enjoy it there because there is a lot of students usually studying there, which I don't understand since it gets loud and crowded, and it is not the cleanest place either. I just walk and drink my milk tea :) Oh, and their restroom is ALWAYS out of order.", "business_id": "fmM-FUmWXrPcCI1HJu32WA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}
