Sooo, unless I just HAVE to get something at her store, I tend to venture to bright ol' Lucy and this is when I get all happy. When I see her bright orange sign, I get all excited because I know I'll find something to purchase, which gets me in trouble every time I enter this store. Their yoga and workout clothes are wonderful! Perfect materials for whatever you're looking for: yoga, running, general fitness, casual, outdoor, etc. I think half of my wardrobe might be Lucy, from their beyond comfortable Hatha pants, to their jackets, socks, and tanks. I read another review where my fellow yelper raved about their undies. Duly noted as my next purchase!! I know that despite being lower than their competitor, Lucy's prices can still be quite steep. However, you definitely are purchasing quality. AND, they have plenty more sales which is where the magic begins. I can't tell you how many things I've bought here that have been about 50% off! I bought a pair of running tights at 40% off and every time I run in them, it feels as though my bottom half is naked. Yes, they're that comfy and they're that great. The service here is also quite nice and attentive. Almost too attentive, however, because the last time I was here, the sales lady poked through my dressing room curtain without so much as a warning to ask me if everything was fitting alright. Feeling a bit exposed at my intrusion, I grabbed whatever could to cover my undressed self and emphatically nodded yes. Maybe it's only when I'm running that I like to feel as though I'm naked and I don't mind one bit.", "business_id": "iOuZxr8qReYRzODiioIvPA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-03", "type": "review"}
