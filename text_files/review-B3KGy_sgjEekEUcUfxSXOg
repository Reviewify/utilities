I came here for dinner the other Sunday night, place was quiet but very nice in terms ambiance.  The menu was very nice.  The service was excellent.  The food would have been good, even excellent except the chef was very heavy with the salt, every dish was salty, excessively so.  Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.   The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.  I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night. To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"!  It was good, showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better.", "business_id": "jeTfL2kCyBtmFGSrSQHqVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-11-16", "type": "review"}
