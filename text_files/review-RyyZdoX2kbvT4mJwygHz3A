I thoroughly enjoyed the food and friendly staff.  Then, one evening after finishing my meal, I looked down and saw a large roach crawling across my hand.  Shocked, I watched as it scurried away into the kitchen.  I made the sad decision not to return.  As an alternative, I suggest Genarro, located at 92nd and Amsterdam.  So far, it has been consistently delicious -- and roach-free!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w"}
