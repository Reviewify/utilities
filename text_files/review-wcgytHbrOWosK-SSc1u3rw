We bought a good size lunch, and squished ourselves in front with plenty of room around us.  Our babies were not the quietest, but were not offensive, and the people around us were enjoying them.  After the other customers left, the owner (Laurie?) came over and told this story to get us to leave: She said that the \"paraplegics\" were on her case about accessibility in her store, and that we had better take our strollers out because she doesn't want to get sued by them.  She played it like she was on our side, but the ADD was the enemy.  Vilifying one disadvantaged group to discriminate against moms with babies.\n\nI went back in a few days later, and pretended to be concerned, also, about the \"paraplegics\" and my own business, and she finally talked herself in circles enough to admit that she thought the other customers had left because of our babies.  I let her know my true feelings and walked out.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I was in the supermarket at the same time as Muzio's owner, Laurie, and she saw me, and made a BIG show of telling a woman who was wearing her baby that she was so proud of her because strollers were just not as good for babies....  She's really a mean-spirited woman, it turns out.\n\nBad people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HFx2yLuVdHSx9ij7JshQHQ"}
