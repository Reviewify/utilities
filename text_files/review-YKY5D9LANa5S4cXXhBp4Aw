And I guess the reason I had a coupon for it (actually multiple coupons, thank you UT Co-op) is because it is not worth it. But around $8 for one buffet, and a crappy one at that. Not much diversity in the choices; there was cheese, pepperoni, pepperoni and sausage, sausage, pepperoni and jalapenos, and another pepperoni. And the pizza does not look appetizing at all. Nor does the pasta. But at least there's a variety. The upside is that there are multiple televisions situated around the place for watching sports. But there really is no point in coming here if you aren't going to watch a game. It's basically a worse version of CiCi's.", "business_id": "RGjokttxmK9-jTTntGB-WQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-08-27", "type": "review"}
