For eight bucks, I want my burrito to either a) make me forget about dinner, if I got it for lunch; b) feed me for two days and make me skip breakfast on the third; c) give me a handjob. MexiCali fails on all three fronts. \n\nThe burrito is poorly put together, the ingredients stingily added and unevenly distributed, so you have dense pockets of meat here, rice there, sour cream the next town over, never to meet. On the other hand, the paucity of core burrito components, esp. meat, means I'm not in danger of slipping into a food coma post meal. Of course, I also forget that I've eaten five minutes later, and find myself either in need of another 8 dollar burrito - so perhaps they're on to something.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIteGpWzFpQblKuwt7H80w"}
