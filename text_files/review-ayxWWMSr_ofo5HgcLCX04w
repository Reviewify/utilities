Not worth it for the price.  \n\nI got the vibe that our waiter hated us.  Not sure why he would have hated us either, we were the exact same demographic as everyone else in there - a couple (or 2) in their late 20s/early 30s with someone (or 2) in their 60s or 70s. \n\nI had the burger.  I found it lacking in cheese with bacon that was so thick and chewy I couldn't get my teeth through it - not classy.  It was cooked perfectly though.  My husband had the roast chicken, which was solid, not necessarily memorable, and our dining companion had the bollito misto, which she said was excellent.  \n\nWe got pressured into dessert and then when dessert came, it wasn't even the one we had ordered, but, they quickly corrected the mistake and let us keep both since they \"couldn't get rid of it otherwise.\"  Unfortunately, neither dessert was particularly good.\n\nSo, overall I was not impressed and felt mildly uncomfortable the entire time, like I was hanging out where I wasn't wanted.  I probably wouldn't be back unless it was another business-type dinner where someone else suggested it and I was dragged along...which I assume is why everyone else was there too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CVIXJlbQsikFI9XeElGe1g"}
