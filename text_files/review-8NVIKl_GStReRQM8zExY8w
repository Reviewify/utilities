Like the other reviewer has said, this place smells like vomit. It also smells like urine. Sometimes it smells like both and I don't know which is worse. On some nights, when someone is hosting some event, it also gets really packed because there is often no where else to go. The drinks are also usually kind of weak... I asked for Jack on the rocks, took and sip and reminded myself to make it a double next time I wanted the equivalent of a full drink. I don't know how it got so watered down? The upsides: the bartenders are pleasant/fun and a lot of times the patrons are oblivious to the fact that there are TWO sides to the bar. It would go a lot faster if you people either got your drinks and moved away from the bar, or if you just went to the other side to spread out the orders. Another bonus: the bartenders are also good-looking (the guys and the girls)! Unfortunately, this is one of three places to \"dance\" in Collegetown (other than Level B and the Palms), so a lot of kids end the night here, trashed, and the bonuses just don't cut it.", "business_id": "9y78ZlpIPAAgyApnPwIUcA", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-02-27", "type": "review"}
