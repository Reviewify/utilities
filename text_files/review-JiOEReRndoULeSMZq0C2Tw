We started with a mezze platter, complete with a mini-fire pit, great presentation. It consisted of grilled lamb, a myriad of savory dips and sauces (yummmm garlic and eggplant), chicken egg-roll like things, spinach dumplings, dolmas and other yummy munchies. The salmon entree was a so-so, I'd stick to the other meats, but came with crunchy haricot verts and a light yogurt sauce. They serve a decent selection of wine and beer as well. The staff was hipster cool, barkeep had an afro. Extra points for picking it out proper. Hawt. I like this place a lot, laid back not snobby or trying to hard. Overall, I'm so glad I live five minutes away. I can picture myself becoming a regular here.", "business_id": "GLP0_Rs2y4Q0Gxk7r1dddQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-04-14", "type": "review"}
