I hope this doesn't happen with Area four. The concept is great; small plates and pizza with fantastic beer and wine and cocktails in a modern environment. And before I say anything bad, their pizzas are fantastic. BUT:\n- They used to offer a sampler of three small plates for $15. Not anymore.\n- They used to offer bread. Not anymore (the waitress told me that it was too taxing for the kitchen (!!)).\n- They charge you $1 for three slies of pita bread (not even a whole pita!).\n- They seriously need to rethink portions as it almost embarassing to order a $8 bluefish and get literally two bites of it. Delicious, but two bites, really?\n\nI have been there three times and enjoyed the food everytime, but my level of satisfaction with the place has deteriorated mainly for the reasons listed above. I will likely go back and just get pizza and beer or pizza to go and hope that they pizzas don't shrink with time :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "WYnXpXym2DMtwchDcbilmg"}
