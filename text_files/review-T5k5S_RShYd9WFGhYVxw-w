I hope this doesn't happen with Area four. The concept is great; small plates and pizza with fantastic beer and wine and cocktails in a modern environment. And before I say anything bad, their pizzas are fantastic. BUT: - They used to offer a sampler of three small plates for $15. Not anymore. - They used to offer bread. Not anymore (the waitress told me that it was too taxing for the kitchen (!!)). - They charge you $1 for three slies of pita bread (not even a whole pita!). - They seriously need to rethink portions as it almost embarassing to order a $8 bluefish and get literally two bites of it. Delicious, but two bites, really? I have been there three times and enjoyed the food everytime, but my level of satisfaction with the place has deteriorated mainly for the reasons listed above. I will likely go back and just get pizza and beer or pizza to go and hope that they pizzas don't shrink with time :)", "business_id": "WYnXpXym2DMtwchDcbilmg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-09", "type": "review"}
