It's the place to be seen on weekend mornings, but the food is mediocre at best.  Combine it with bad service, and you get two stars.  I've been 3-4 times now, and the waitresses have, on all visits, forgotten something, brought food out at weird intervals, or otherwise demonstrated a lack of any sort of focus on good, consistent service from the owners and/or managers.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and hit a better brunch place for better food or just hit the Eat'n Park down the street for solid brunch food with better service.  \n\nI really want to follow my standard rule and take another star off for not taking credit cards, too, but I'll be nice and keep them at two.  Pamela's is by no means a tiny mom and pop place, so it's time for them to realize that it's not 1985 anymore.  (Of course, that would make it harder to hide revenue, too.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "FXSmA6oWEvylen1QnVZlAA"}
