Owners, works and all people who support this place, please feel proud. I was proud to be a live while feasting. The food is sensational. Service superb and I just am beaming with so much joy and delight that there is a place that serves both phenomenal food and value/philosophy behind it. I wish there was one on every corner. After my first night there, I am committed to return as much as I am able as how cool would the world be if there were as many of these restaurants as Star Bucks. I will keep voting with my dollar and come back! I am so deeply grateful for what you are doing!", "business_id": "gcf4bQVbiOqglEmYBfbpwQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-06-23", "type": "review"}
