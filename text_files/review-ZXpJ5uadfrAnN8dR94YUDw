This is honestly one of the best used/vintage/consignment stores I have ever stepped into. Price tags are low if you're used to big city prices and they have an ingenious pricing system where things get cheaper the longer they've been sitting there (and usually the good stuff goes quickly). Just check the date on the little sticker.\n\nIt's so fun to pore over all the goods they have and I always find something amazing to take home for myself or as a gift. I LOVE TREASURE MART.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cJzvAKvh2i16fO91YZ8_pQ"}
