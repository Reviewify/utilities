I went of a night when there wasn't live music, but the place was still a buzz and the atmosphere pleasant.\n\nThey had some nice beers on tap and lots of choices for liquor-drinking folks. I was extremely pleased the the complimentary corn bread that they serve; it's was so damn good! The appetizers and entrees were equally terrific and served in large portions. I liked my Jumbalaya so much that I couldn't wait to eat my leftovers for breakfast the next day!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bf-6Bh9gM6gEJHr4tdd7iA"}
