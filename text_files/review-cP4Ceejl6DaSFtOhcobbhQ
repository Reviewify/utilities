It is not a luxurious club, no hot tub or swimming pool. Bathrooms are always clean.  There are some very fun and good teachers to lead the many various classes.  Lots of dance classes.  Due to age and injuries I can't do all types of dance high energy, lots of arching, but there is tap, zumba, pilates, yoga, strengthening classes.   Members are friendly.   The price is reasonable.  It work for me.   There have been 3 incidents with cancelled classes or a problem with a teacher.  The management listen and responded well with 2 of the 3 issues.", "business_id": "eqHSSfYCQ8yo3IAjDRguxQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-14", "type": "review"}
