It was pretty good!\n\nI got the Casa Azul Combination with a chicken tamal (is it 'gringo' to spell this with an 'e'? Have I been wrong all along? bah), chicken enchilada, and carnitas taco. Usually combinations like this at Mexican restaurants leave me hungry, but I could barely finish this. Everything was good, though. I remember the chicken being especially tender.\n\nOur appetizers and entrees all came out pretty quickly, and the servers were attentive  throughout our meal.\n\nI really liked the decor in here...yes, very blue, but it's certainly different. I loved the little cactus centerpieces with blue rocks.\n\nIt's not often that I crave Mexican food, but I legitimately liked this place. Hope it can stand the test of time in Westwood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EkG5CXl366qLwZlTJbCuuQ"}
