This place serves some of the best Mexican food in Palo Alto. They have a huge selection of burritos, which definitely rivals Chipotle. Also, I have a place in my heart for the fish tacos. Also have great burgers and fries. Also have great brews on tap. If you find yourself on Stanford campus and need some quick eats, this place will hit the spot.", "business_id": "xZD4d_xSi3rxClb3NWOFyg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-06", "type": "review"}
