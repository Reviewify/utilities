They have a huge selection of burritos, which definitely rivals Chipotle. Also, I have a place in my heart for the fish tacos. \n\nAlso have great burgers and fries. \n\nAlso have great brews on tap. \n\nIf you find yourself on Stanford campus and need some quick eats, this place will hit the spot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xZD4d_xSi3rxClb3NWOFyg"}
