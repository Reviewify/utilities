(we shared). and jen had this yummy chopped salad with cabbage and apples and other veggies. \n\nwe both very much enjoyed our dinners and our drinks. the service was efficient and friendly.  if i lived here  i would make this a regular choice. \n\nand the food here too is all organic and free-range. yay!! i love that.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8lLs3dsSN-Am2_EtNfbXqA"}
