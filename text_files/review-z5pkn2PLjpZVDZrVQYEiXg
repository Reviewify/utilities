Once a quick salad and drinks and the second time a full 3 course meal (and drinks). Each time was great. The service is excellent - very knowledabel and friendly. There is also a great bar that is perfect for after hours or a happy hour if you're not in the mood for food.", "business_id": "kLYRrAjvNW_eXvgjVvYdqw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-05-30", "type": "review"}
