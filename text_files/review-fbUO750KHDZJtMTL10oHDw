(that's $0.50 USD for you folks slow on the draw) Okay, so I come here a lot because the brewed coffee is cheap & good.  5 stars for that.  They have a pretty good selection of pasteries, sweets, and sammies in the deli case, and it's all pretty decent grub.  Good as you'll get elsewhere on campus, maybe better, for less dough.  Service is quick, if not inspired.  Don't expect a real \"cafe\" experience.  It's upstairs in the bookstore at Stanford not the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Still the best place for coffee on campus...in case you didn't pick up on that.", "business_id": "-ar6SC9nUaam_KbOJOgn-A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-25", "type": "review"}
