I've been here several times and am always impressed by the traditional southern feel in such a bland location. The barbecue here is excellent, rivaling some of the other 'southern' restaurants around here. I have to reiterate what some of my fellow Yelpers have said too: everything is fresh! You can taste the freshness in everything from the biscuits to the corn, and that makes me love Bon's even more. The prices are cheap, too, making it a great option for a college student. My one complaint is that it can get extremely busy during the work week, and that the hours are not that accommodating.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TpUmiPjOrsQUK_eHYg62Lg"}
