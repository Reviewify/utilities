I've been here before, and I will come here again. I'm quite looking forward to it. The last time I was here was actually my first time. Pleasant company in tow, and we were already pleasantly inebriated when we arrived. We were also in the mood for some sushi. There was a bit of a wait time (less than 10 min), which was slightly annoying because I was really hungry. I can look past that as it was a dinner rush. When we were finally seated, the staff apologized for the wait and was quick to take our order. The Sashimi Special was only $13.99 and very plentiful for 2 to share...more delicate of a cut, which I like. I also had the spider roll...only $4.99 and very satisfactory...I was definitely making \"mmmm\" sounds and happy dancing a bit in my chair. My dinner companion was super hungry so he got the chicken teriyaki bento. Plentiful portions for the price and pretty good according to him. One more thing that I can recall loving is the salad dressing...hint of peanut flavoring that was creamy and delish!!! I drank what was left in my salad bowl. The only downer was that I could not order any sake to go with my meal. Other than that I was pleasantly surprised and satiated from my experience here.", "business_id": "2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-05", "type": "review"}
