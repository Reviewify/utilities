Not the best, apparently, but great for Austin.  He wasn't too excited about the jambalaya, though--not so good.\n\nMy spicy falafel wrap was tasty, but it was missing something...next time I think I'll ask them to put some hummus on it, or something else.  Too dry.\n\nNOTE: this place is a little pricey.  The wraps aren't too bad ($6), but a 12\" po-boy will cost you $11-$12.  Ouch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5CGyxYZzCp7_IcJU8yCphA"}
