The price is right, the people are always very friendly and supportive, and I even get a kick out of all the cool pictures on the walls leading in (from a variety of wars and services). Parking is always a breeze, and I've found that the wait times aren't NEARLY as long as they were just 10 years ago. They've also made things easier, like mailing your meds to you - so you don't have to rush over to the pharmacy after work and hope that you make it in time. The billing system is easy to keep track of, and I pay my bills online. Since you don't have to pay a premium (and I'm just a 10 year submarine vet, by the way), it really is very inexpensive compared to what my company has to offer. Thank you, everybody at the VA - for all you do for veterans.", "business_id": "VCYtAEbTtb8wzKFg0Pe6pQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-12", "type": "review"}
