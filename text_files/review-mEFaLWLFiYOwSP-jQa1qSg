They specialize in dishes from Oaxaca and I've never had a bad meal here.  I seem to always get the Mole Oaxaqueno, but I have tasted other dishes - burritos, camarones, etc. - which I would like to get in future visits.  All of the dishes are prepared fresh, as you order, in a very small open kitchen right behind the counter.  You may have to wait for a seat, since the place is usually full during meal times.  The portions are large and carefully presented and the mole sauce is outstanding.  The small staff (usually just 3 people) keeps up with the tables and the orders with friendly enthusiasm.  One of my favorite places in the Princeton area.", "business_id": "le-ggzbaqSpm_qN6R8pUoA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-22", "type": "review"}
