If you're a jock and/or want to party all the time, this isn't for you and please go somewhere else so you don't ruin this really good university. If you want to go to college to meet hot chicks/guys and get ten kinds of laid, this isn't for you and please go somewhere else so you don't ruin this really good university. If you want to study something you don't care about and score an impressive degree that will get you a job that you don't care about, please go somewhere else and don't ruin this really good university.\n\nThe educational program is really amazing, if you have an interest in that. The social life is also really amazing, if your definition of social life is anything other than completely shallow. This is the kind of school you should go to if you want to see yourself, the world, and the people around you in a deeper, more nuanced, more interesting way. If you want to binge drink your way to orgasms between tests that get you jobs that pay money, find a different school.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_-AeUaBwErMAzg6drc--kA"}
