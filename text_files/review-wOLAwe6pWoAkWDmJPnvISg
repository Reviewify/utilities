They even continued to give me free tune-ups after purchasing a bike from here years ago.  The only down side I'd say is that things are a little pricey... but support your local business, right?  Since then I've bought a similar bike at Costco, but when I add all the tuneups and adjustments I've had to pay for our of pocket since, my purchase from Foothill Cyclery was a far better deal in the long run. If I purchase a bike again in SLO, I know who I'll return to.", "business_id": "72wyuRVAiaOHFBh1UH9F7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-10", "type": "review"}
