I waited 15 minutes to speak to a sales person, and took another 10 minutes going over options. The sales person was knowledgeable. She explained that mounting is done by another company and due to the machines used, the margin of error for cropping is high (1/8 in). We agreed that the painting should be cropped 1/8 in on two sides, and she wrote the instructions clearly on my order form. So far so good... I went to pick up my order and discovered that the instructions had been ignored. The painting was mounted as-is - no cropping. The mounting process is irreversible, so I was naturally disappointed. Instead of apologizing or offering a discount of some kind, the same sales person announced that SHE was \"okay with it,\" that the person who was getting the painting as a gift \"probably won't notice\"...and really it was out of their hands because they use this third party company. Bottom line: There was no accountability whatsoever. I have purchased from Reprint Mint many times over 15 years and have not had problems, so this episode was a shock.
