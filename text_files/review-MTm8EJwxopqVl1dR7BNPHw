Definitely not white tablecloth, special occasion. But the American steak, chops, burger type menu is very good.\nEach entre comes with a crispy loaf of bread (take some home and toast for breakfast!) and both regular and flavored butter.\nI had a great, substantial size burger with nice lettuce, onion, and tomato and pickle. Plus, I substituted a generous serving of broccoli for the fries.  So for me, a great meal for 10 bucks!\nService is friendly and good while not exactly polished, but then it fits the place.\nI recommend it for a hearty, informal meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kYMVnNaMcnDIjmNAH4uF3g"}
