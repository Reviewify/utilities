Definitely not white tablecloth, special occasion. But the American steak, chops, burger type menu is very good. Each entre comes with a crispy loaf of bread (take some home and toast for breakfast!) and both regular and flavored butter. I had a great, substantial size burger with nice lettuce, onion, and tomato and pickle. Plus, I substituted a generous serving of broccoli for the fries. So for me, a great meal for 10 bucks! Service is friendly and good while not exactly polished, but then it fits the place. I recommend it for a hearty, informal meal.", "business_id": "kYMVnNaMcnDIjmNAH4uF3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-30", "type": "review"}
