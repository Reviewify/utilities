I was debating between the baked red snapper with mango salsa and chicken pasta diabolo. With the recommendation from the chef and my liking for mango, I chose the red snapper. The fish really surprised me with its tender top and crispy bottom. It also came with asparagus and brown rice. The brown rice was alright, but the asparagus was very good. Oh, I loved their bread so much that after I finished my entree, I made sure none of the bread go back to the kitchen.", "business_id": "ZiLCt6uZlGY61roYdfeqWA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-30", "type": "review"}
