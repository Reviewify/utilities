I like the Red Velvet cake fro-yo topped with cookie dough and whatever i feel for the night. This place is definitely a chill social spot and the environment is great! Right by campus (though, i do not attend UofI) and near everything else. The staff always greets with a smile coming in and going out. 5 stars most definitely!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dNch89PUCbxvhieKmWi8LQ"}
