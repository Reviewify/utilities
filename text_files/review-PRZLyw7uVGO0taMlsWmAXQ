In Hyattsville?!  Shirley you jest!\" I was delightfully surprised when in fact this neon sign adorned establishment did in fact house a brewery AND a general store!  As my fiance and I sat down after a long days work and being delighted that the pay for parking isn't enforced after 6 pm we ordered some fine Pints of brew.  I chose the Milk Stout and she chose the Seasonal Ocktoberfest.  I was pretty impressed with the Stout, it was creamy and dark like I would have expected, and her Ocktoberfest was faintly spiced and had a nut brown tang.  We were quickly given a basket of bread which, after a long day of work and lack of food, we quickly dived in.  I was not impressed.  This bread was lack luster and half of the rolls were hard has granite straight from the quarry.  Meh. I'm not there for the rolls anyways.   I ordered the fish and chips while she ordered a veggie flat bread.  I'll be perfectly honest, it's pretty standard food.  Not overly fantastic but not as bland as cardboard.  I was not expecting culinary masterpieces.  But the fish and chips could have at least had some seasoning!? or a beer batter, it is a brewery after all.  My lady's flat bread was a strange cacophony of veggies, hummus and other non-meated items that I ended up eating because she wasn't quite sure what to think of it.  Their menu was quite broad and had a lot to offer.  This is my first visit and I was quite impressed with the beers, I'll most definitely go back.  Not to mention the fact that its Hyattsville....where else am I going to go.  Definitely after 6 though....no way in hell am I paying for parking at a restaurant in freakin Hyattsville.", "business_id": "XEvLTGnZ_ZLI3CiPlzM2NA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-07", "type": "review"}
