The walls are pink, the floors are leopard and zebra prints, and the feeling you get when you step inside is purely whimsical.  I felt like Alice in Wonderland.  I'd never expect a place with such eccentricity would be a fine dining establishment, but it was.  With the exception of the oh so annoying teenagers celebrating a birthday or something at a nearby table, and our phantom waiter who would appear and then disappear indefinitely, the experience here was actually really good.  My friend had the caesar salad with the toad in the hole (which I tasted, yummy) and the burger, while I enjoyed a comforting dish of pappardelle with duck ragu, garnished with a crispy piece of duck fat.  HEAVEN!  I'd love to try more of their menu, but from my first impression, the food is great and the ambiance is totally Victoria!  Gotta love it!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "jI4yOYZ7nZt1Yv_9GolxYg"}
