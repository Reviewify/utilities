The only reason I ever go to this Wal-mart is that it has the super groceries inside of it.  As much as you want to hate on them, they usually position themselves to be in a \"upper-hand\" situation in smaller towns.  They have a Subway inside as well as other little shops (eye care, nail salon, etc).  They LOOOVE their Hokies around these parts so expect to see everything with a 'Hokies' logo on it.", "business_id": "GBC4DyQOspHcFnDECKF4ig", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}
