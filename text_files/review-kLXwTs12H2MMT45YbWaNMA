The only reason I ever go to this Wal-mart is that it has the super groceries inside of it. \n\nAs much as you want to hate on them, they usually position themselves to be in a \"upper-hand\" situation in smaller towns. \n\nThey have a Subway inside as well as other little shops (eye care, nail salon, etc). \n\nThey LOOOVE their Hokies around these parts so expect to see everything with a 'Hokies' logo on it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GBC4DyQOspHcFnDECKF4ig"}
