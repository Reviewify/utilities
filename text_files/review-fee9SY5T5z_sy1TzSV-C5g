Having been in Belgium and also speaking for my boyfriend who is Belgian, I must say these waffles are awful, chewy, gooey and undercooked on the inside plus burnt on the outside. The whipped cream is nothing more but an instant fake-tasting something. We also ordered hot chocolate which tasted like the cheapest hot chocolate from the vending machine. I actually saw how it was made, powder plus hot water - disgusting! If you like good food/if you ever had a real Belgian waffle - beware and don't go there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "umSO7veSVjf8QflZOonmlA"}
