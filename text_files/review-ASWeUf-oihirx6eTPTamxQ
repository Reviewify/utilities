I'm not much of a fancy drink person, but their beer list is unique and they have a great wine list that's very reasonably priced.\n\nMost recently, I went for dinner with some friends.  I wasn't sure how they were going to react to us basically ordering several appetizers and one entree to split, but they took the order without a hitch and without any judgement.  \n\nAs for the food:\n\nCheese plate:  Kind of small with only two kinds of cheese, but I can't ever truly criticize a cheese plate.\n\nMarinated Olives:  Exactly what it sounds like.\n\nShrimp, Avocado and Tomato:  This is a cold dip with kind of bland doughy things to dip in it.  The dip itself was absolutely delicious.\n\n\"Chip and Dip of the Day\":  On this day it was homemade kettle chips with onion dip.  Fantabulous.\n\nMac and Cheese:  Huge portion, and absolutely amazing.  I can't believe one person could eat this in a sitting.  Delicious pasta with cheese, bacon, and interesting spices.\n\nOverall, a great experience in a great atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JdWplSS3RfBFamm4FshtcA"}
