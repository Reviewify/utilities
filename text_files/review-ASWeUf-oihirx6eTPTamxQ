I'm not much of a fancy drink person, but their beer list is unique and they have a great wine list that's very reasonably priced. Most recently, I went for dinner with some friends.  I wasn't sure how they were going to react to us basically ordering several appetizers and one entree to split, but they took the order without a hitch and without any judgement.   As for the food: Cheese plate:  Kind of small with only two kinds of cheese, but I can't ever truly criticize a cheese plate. Marinated Olives:  Exactly what it sounds like. Shrimp, Avocado and Tomato:  This is a cold dip with kind of bland doughy things to dip in it.  The dip itself was absolutely delicious. \"Chip and Dip of the Day\":  On this day it was homemade kettle chips with onion dip.  Fantabulous. Mac and Cheese:  Huge portion, and absolutely amazing.  I can't believe one person could eat this in a sitting.  Delicious pasta with cheese, bacon, and interesting spices. Overall, a great experience in a great atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back.", "business_id": "JdWplSS3RfBFamm4FshtcA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-05-26", "type": "review"}
