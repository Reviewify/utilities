They randomly changed my appointment to a later one, without letting me know. What's worse is they checked me in and made me wait in the examination room for 40 mins before the doctor even saw me. If the appointment had changed, couldn't they have told me when I checked-in? Ridiculous administration. But no other choices if you are a student at Stanford, so I guess I'll have to stick with it.", "business_id": "3ScIVDdxk6C7gE5Nb2VS2w", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-04-02", "type": "review"}
