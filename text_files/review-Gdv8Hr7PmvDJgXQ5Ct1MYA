Even if you do not describe yourself as a vegetarian or vegan, the food at Saturn Caf\u00e9 will satisfy even those that prefer to eat meat!  After much deliberation on what to order, I decided on the FLT sandwich (Fakin bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo on toasted sourdough) and fries (thin cut).  Both the FLT sandwich and fries tasted so good.  The fakin bacon even had the same texture and crunch as the real thing!  Eating a burger or a sandwich at Saturn Caf\u00e9 really feels like a guilt-free pleasure.  Next time I will definitely leave room so that I may try out the awesome desserts sold here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "S4a-MaxMszQjSPSs1JSM2A"}
