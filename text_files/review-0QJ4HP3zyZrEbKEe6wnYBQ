We also got two different flavors of their on tap kombucha and they were both delicious as well. The desserts were extremely cheap and tasted great. We didn't try the frozen yogurt but it was described as a coconut milk based mint/vanilla flavored soft serve. I can't wait!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z5JVHHv1SB0uQYzkKsT_qQ"}
