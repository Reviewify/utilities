I was offended by the idea of paying cover at a dive bar.  That, and the drinks aren't even that strong.  I'm not paying $12 a drink but I still don't like the idea of watered-down vodka and the obligatory tip for the bartender. I also don't like getting accosted by 18 year olds, which has been the recurring theme every time I'm there.  Management needs to be more selective in what passes as a fake ID.
