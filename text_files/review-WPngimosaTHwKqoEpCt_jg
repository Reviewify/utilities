There are a couple of good beers--usually Stone Arrogant Bastard and IPA and Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA--along with some \"good\" mass market Euro beers if you're into that kind of thing.  The dinner food isn't very good, but the appetizers are alright.  I've been here more than I care to admit for happy hour drinks ($3 beers) and snacks simply because it's directly across the street from Columbia and a block from my apartment.  The outdoor seating is also nice, and it easily beats the garbage food and lousy bar a block down at Haakon's Hall.  Late at night, the crowd goes from after-work to lounge-y/creepy, so I never go here after 10.", "business_id": "bWasMbk9JZLQLQf_EUr2Sg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-22", "type": "review"}
