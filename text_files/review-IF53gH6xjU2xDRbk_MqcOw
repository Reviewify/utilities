The bartender was really nice and the whole waitstaff seemed to be ready and willing to grab a dish or ask if we needed anything. It was nice to see they did not see to have that \"not my job\" attitude. We started with the risotto and the parsnip soup and they were both amazing, rich in flavor and perfectly cooked. The next round of appetizers did not go as well. The octopus which we have had before unfortunately was over cooked, it normally has a char which is excellent but it was so tough that it was difficult to cut and chew. We joked it would make a good dog treat because it would last a bit. The sweetbread ravioli did not do it for us either. The sauce was sort of sweet and not overly flavorful, the pasta was a bit tough, and the sweetbread just seemed like we were eating a potato ravioli. We ended with this perfect cheese. I loved it but my SO has a bias against cheeses wrapped in herbs. He thinks it allows the cheese to not be very good because all you can taste is herbs. Well I disagreed and enjoyed the flavors.", "business_id": "RThn3_Y6qN8MsqZKWa6WyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-12-18", "type": "review"}
