So.....I wasn't totally impressed with the food or the service. But, the food wasn't bad. I think that Pasta Bene is a good option for students where they can eat something more than fried/fatty foods. In addition, the place is clean and airy. The prices are reasonable and the food is served quickly. So, you can get in and out.", "business_id": "QQIjsdcokFermi2ugoD6ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-11", "type": "review"}
