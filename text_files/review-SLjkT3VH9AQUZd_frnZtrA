The cupcake is moist and flavorful and so good.  All of the ingredients are excellent.  I also love the cream cheese frosting which there was lots of.  Really can't go wrong with $3.25 of pure goodness.\n\nThe Palo Alto town & country location is quite small, however when i visited, there was a very short line and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I will be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A"}
