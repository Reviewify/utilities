It has been busier than earlier in the semester when it was relatively new, the service is spotty but has gotten better, and the food is also replaced more frequently. The lunch buffet here is, in my opinion, the best in town because the food is flavorful without being too mild (read, bland). They also have a good selection of vegetarian dishes. The saag here is pretty good, and comes with paneer or chickpeas. Malai kofta was also good, and I like their okra masala. They have the crowd pleaser as well- chicken tikka masala or butter chicken will always be one of the options. They also often have kadai mushrooms. I am another person who loves the chicken 65 here, moist and tender and spicy. Also, I'm not sure if we're talking about the same \"bald waiter\" but mine was quite friendly, especially after couple visits in the same week.", "business_id": "Cl9eNsG77yDH93hzmwD5gA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-16", "type": "review"}
