They do accept credit cards, I have been here several times and they have never told me no to using my credit card...hmm.  \nCan I just say \"YAY\" I am a fan!! I love love this place.  There is never any long waiting lines.  Its communial sitting.  So you stand in line to get your breakfast and then you sit on one of the long tables and have a conversation with ur friends or \"New\" friends..whichever you prefer :D \nI heart their egg fried sandwhich.  Its my fav!! and their chocolate crossiant is to die for..literally, I always feel I went to heaven and came back! lol\nIt such a cute neighbourhood boulangerie, I can't get enough of it.  I have made sure to take all my friends from out of town here, just to exprience the wonderful quick goodies and treats they have to offer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fTSnCqv9XiDZkUCA1XZ7Mw"}
