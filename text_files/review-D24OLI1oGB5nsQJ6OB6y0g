The environment was pleasant well light with no overly loud sounds. My type of place. I got a wonderful tuna salad w/ olive tapenade w/ steamed beans. I was in heaven with the dressing it had on it, and it had just the right amount on it. It was any olive fish lovers dream. Capers topped it with arugula and it was all on top of a cibatta roll. Beyond Yum. Great service, cute wait staff and warm n' cozy. Def going there again.", "business_id": "F6Qsav77WqGhstQ1E2xRGQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}
