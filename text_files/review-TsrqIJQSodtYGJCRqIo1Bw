His team is extremely patient, well informed, professional and very helpful. If you are looking for a place to get a ring - Look no further!!! You will not be disappointed here. I must have visited over 7-8 other stores (big brand names) before I decided to get the ring for my fiance from Neil. Neil and Ruth patiently worked with me throughout the entire process of selecting the diamond, the setting and making it all fit into my budget. After countless appointments, emails going over every minute detail, we concluded on the perfect ring. Thanks a lot Neil. She really loves the ring and I couldn't be any happier. Kudos!", "business_id": "IBz37nHTguMVvSfLQHeZZA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-18", "type": "review"}
