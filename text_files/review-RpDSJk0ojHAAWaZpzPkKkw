I saw this place as I walked around the block from the Border Tex-Mex restaurant and it looked friendly enough. At first I thought...\"Borders?\" Then as I walked in farther, I realized \"Ah, Barnes & Noble.\" The font on the signage and images of the famous past authors should have been a 'dead giveaway.' The only difference was that the color on the signage was red, in honor of the famous college one block away. It wasn't as crowded in here as others have mentioned before me. It was actually pretty sparse, but perhaps that just how the crowd is on a Sunday evening. The banners on the side show a seal with \"Veritas,\" which, if you remember your basic Latin or took some Romance language, means \"Truth.\" These banners lined up the first floor all the way to the rear stairs. The bottom floor from ground level contain the children's area. This adheres to the old saying, \"Children must not be seen nor heard.\" The second floor is the coffee shop. This is where laptop touting under-slept students hang out. You're forced to walk through here in order to get to the other side of the spiraling staircase. The third floor is vital. This is where the restrooms are. Just be aware that the mens restroom actually has no urinal. As a matter of fact, there aren't paper towels either...just a blow dry machine that makes a terribly loud sound and will disturb everyone on the floor. Of all the things to take away from this bookstore, this is it.", "business_id": "qzWezPhAWVaMizNgNYd98g", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-16", "type": "review"}
