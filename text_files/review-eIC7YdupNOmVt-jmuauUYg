So we decided to go to the food court so that everyone could get whatever they wanted! But the food here looked so good that we all ended up eating here!!! We had samosa chaat - good, chana bhatura - okay, paneer kathi rool - excellent, combo platter with panchmel daal and saag paneer - excellent, masala chai - very good and their breads were made very fresh from scratch!!! yayee, I'm a fan of this place!  The only one reason it didn't earn 5-stars is that the food was kinda pricey, especially for being in a food court! (For the record, this and 4 others are owned by the same person who owns the Gourmet India in Boston's Prudential Center!)", "business_id": "rblZR9xtCUgwjE19AU2y8w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-24", "type": "review"}
