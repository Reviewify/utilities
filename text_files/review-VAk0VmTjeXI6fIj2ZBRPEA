Wooden table in small dining area.  The service I would say was very good as of a few months ago.  The food changed with season so you might not find the same food unless you frequent the restaurant.  Lantern is more of an Asian Fusion place.  Between Lantern and Jujubee, I would prefer Lantern a lot more.  The atmosphere although a little bit upscale but casual and easy going in comparison with Jujubee which was stiff and unfriendly.  \nThe food was better at Lantern than Jujubee as well.  Some of the appertizer portion was pretty big so unless you came in a group, I would recommend just ordered the entree.  \nI tried of the fish special a few months back.  I was not as good as I had hoped it would had been.  Maybe the non-special items might have tasted better.\n\nAmbience was nice and cozy.  Table is a little bit close to one another due to limited space.  But other than that, I would definitely come back.  The price was a little bit higher than other restaurant in the area.  So if you are in for good service and good food with unlimited spending budget, I would recommend trying out Lantern.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "W8eWYE6aFExgGzlKBtICNg"}
