He got a burger and I got a cheese veggie sandwich. He thought the quality of the meat was better than inn and out. My sandwich was soggy and ok tasting. They don't grill the outside of the bun. We also shared a regular size of cajun fries that were too salty and soggy. Also the portion is too big, even for 2 people. I prefer the grilled cheese sandwich at inn and out. I wouldn't come back here. The only pros were the friendly staff and peanuts.", "business_id": "s8_cb1ArVaRypkda__Gkvg", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-07-31", "type": "review"}
