It occurred to me they were a full week old.  I convinced myself that it's okay, so I ate them and I'm still okay (hopefully).  The fries were from Harlem Tavern.  Harlem Tavern is a big ass restaurant with quite a bit of outdoor, front house and side walk seating.  Red, big deck umbrellas can be seen a block away. Deep indoors it's loud and there's a bar.  It's not typically my kind of place, I tend to like restaurants with charm and intimacy not pizazz.\n\nPrices are reasonable and the food was good for the most part.  My lamb burger was flavorful and affordable. The fried calamari is delish and crispy, generously portioned it comes with a kicking sauce.  The steak salad my friend got she found mediocre.  The mussels were good, although it's pretty hard to make bad mussels.  If you are into french fries, Harlem Tavern doesn't skimp on them so you can take home leftovers and have them a week later.\n\nService, although friendly, was a bit scattered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uCsyRxfIfiRqQQuK_JlfZA"}
