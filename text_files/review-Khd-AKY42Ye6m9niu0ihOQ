I realize that I am very biased but this is hands down the best bar in Harvard Square.  You can complain about the service but a lot of the customers bring a inflated sense of entitlement into the bar and simply don't like being put in their place.  The food is decent and if you ask for recommendation you will often be pleasantly surprised.  If you are out looking for a good time you'll find it here.  If you go out and think you're in Faneuil Hall you will probably not.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
