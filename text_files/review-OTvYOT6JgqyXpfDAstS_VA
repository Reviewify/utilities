I've done regular yoga in Boston and San Francisco before, and oh boy, is Bikram so different! First, the good: it WILL stretch you out! I have very tight hams and calfs because I swim four miles a week in a chilly water pool. Bikram really loosens up my muscles. It will also get your heart rate up, so it doubles as cardio. The workout is a great skin and body cleanser - I felt pure, like I sweated all the yuck out and was left with glowing and lumnious skin. The instructors vary but I generally found them to be very knowledgeable and clear in their instructions. Some (not all) I also found to be really encouraging and kind. Others make you feel inferior if you dont' show up there on a regular basis. The downsides - it's HOT and I felt faint towards the end. The first several times I put my mat by the door, which helped as there's a tiny bit of draft under it. The fourth time I was in a part of the studio with no air and I've never felt closer to fainting in my whole life. I lasted until the end but barely and bolted out the door without stretching. One time they had to call the paramedics for someone who had collapsed after the workout. It also doesn't help that the studio is very popular and gets super crowded, which tends to reduce the oxygen supply and makes the room seem hotter. So I really try to take it easy towards the end and give myself enough time to decompress by sitting in the common area and sipping water. Overall, a good experience, but I'm happy to hear that not all Bikram studios are that hot.", "business_id": "-lt4Eu6KPmfiqXglu_FKtw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-20", "type": "review"}
