(i should note, with the exception of some of the appetizers, most of the menu was rather uninspired.) on a positive note, the bread tomato-garlic sauce was an interesting twist on the complimentary appetizer, and the highlight of the meal may have been the sweet potato fries. nevertheless, given the price, i will have to pass on mahagony grill next time.", "business_id": "AeWKgDveIWXCDP5O9HzO3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-12", "type": "review"}
