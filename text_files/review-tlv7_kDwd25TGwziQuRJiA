The location and the decor is excellent.  No issues with the service, either.  As for the food... well, let's just say that most of the salt in their kitchen found its way in our lobster bisque and nothing else.  We couldn't even finish the bisque, it was so salty.  My steak and potatoes had less seasoning than I might have desired, and the vegetables were a little undercooked.  My wife's sirloin burger was what one would expect from such a simple dish.  (I should note, with the exception of some of the appetizers, most of the menu was rather uninspired.)  On a positive note, the bread tomato-garlic sauce was an interesting twist on the complimentary appetizer, and the highlight of the meal may have been the sweet potato fries.  Nevertheless, given the price, I will have to pass on Mahagony Grill next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AeWKgDveIWXCDP5O9HzO3Q"}
