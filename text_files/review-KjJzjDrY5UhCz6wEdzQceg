So I was super excited when my husband visited this store and one of the guys happily told him that we were two weeks away from a free upgrade. And I went in today to take advantage of that.  Unfortunately, there were complications because I had temporarily gotten a new phone in August after the robbery and then returned it when I found our old back ups.  However, Darrell was great - he explained everything multiple times to make sure that I understood it was a function of the system, and why even if he overrode the system, I would have trouble with the mail-in refund, and I still wouldn't get the lowest price.  So he took care of upgrading the other phones on the account, then connected me to customer service and helped me straighten everything out.  AWESOME SERVICE.", "business_id": "wKKRoSg1pZQtQRYPoD7TXg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-02", "type": "review"}
