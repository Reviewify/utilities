I find the items not on sale to be overpriced however. But they usually have a good amount of things on sale. The quality of the meat there can improve. Many times the beef and pork there looked brown rather than their pink/red color.  The baked goods there is just okay too. Not a big fan of their cakes.  I usually don't come here unless I have to pick up something quick like salt, surgar, or ice creams  If you have time or are willing to go to Princeton, go to Wegman's. So much better in the quality and the price", "business_id": "os2nfVL-eiIXzBFHYMZCLw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-09-02", "type": "review"}
