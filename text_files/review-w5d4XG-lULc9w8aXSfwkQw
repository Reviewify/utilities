The Baja shrimp taco is my favorite.  The Brushfire is as spicey as it sounds ( a little too hot for me), but, the Baja is just right.  They sometimes have a special made with salmon that is also very good.  Only drawback to this location is the parking.  Very tight and filters out to a very busy street.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XjC5H-uKRrsctioXxuCMQQ"}
