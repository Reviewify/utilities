Most of the animals in there are trapped in cages that do not resemble their natural habitats, yet at the same time , if released into the wild, they would have nowhere to run. I mean, think about it! Where is a fully grown giraffe going to get leaves in Houston? The golf course next door? I suppose that's a possibility but even then I am doubtful about its chances of survival. The only thing I don't like about the Zoo is that it is outside. This a shame because most animals would prefer to live air-conditioned environments like the snakes do. I guess lions like Houston because it is cooler than the Sahara desert, but most animals are found either in the ocean or rainforests. I find it strange that they want to live in Houston heat instead of sweet southern A/C Some advice- be careful at the zoo because while in cages, some of the animals can be dangerous to humans. Especially in the reptile room.", "business_id": "rsEJu-ANPOBdSaR4ikLHgg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-11", "type": "review"}
