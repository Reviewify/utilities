I was a bit upset and told the manager. I think the owner(s) were there too an they promptly jumped on my sandwich, inspected it and took it to the trash. I then had them replace it with a plain turkey sandwich (a better indicator of sandwich places actually) and they were quick and polite to respond.  I am not sure if it was because the owners were lurking bout, but I received my sandwich very quickly and the manager served me my sandwich and explained that hot sandwiches should be on toasted bread and that the cashier should of asked me (he was actually my cashier though). I too was apologetic saying that I don't often complain (which I don't) and ate my sandwich.  The turkey sandwich was a 3.5 with the crust on the sourdough being a little too tough to chew. In hindsight I would have gotten rye or pumpernickel bread with the turkey. Nice amount of turkey in there, crisp lettuce and tomato.  Now I see a man taking his sandwich back as I'm writing this.  Oh wow that guy did not look happy as they dissected his sandwich to show him where the meat was. I have the feeling someone in the kitchen is gonna get fired. Or at least a strong talking to.  It gets busy at lunch time. I was here at 12:30 on a Thursday. Why I decide to eat when all the other sheep are feeding is a total mystery to me. Perhaps I enjoy the chaos.  The curry chicken gets a 1, the service gets a 3 and the turkey a 3.5. Seems like yelped assessment of this place is pretty spot on.", "business_id": "Ta8F63eZ2RLXLytYk5vl9w", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-10", "type": "review"}
