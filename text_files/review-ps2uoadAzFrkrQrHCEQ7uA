Yeah, it's the mama in me, but the pictures look like sex kitten versions of my 15 year old daughter and no way in hell am I going to subscribe to the sex sells message here, even if the garments are made in the good old U. S. of A. for a fair wage - although I still bet that \"fair\" wage is actually minimum wage. Besides, the clothing itself seems run of the mill t-shirts and things you can get anywhere, or even learn to sew for yourself, and even if some poor woman or kid in some Third World county is getting pennies a day, which is a tragedy, at least they aren't completely starving to death, while in the meantime, there are stores that pay fair prices to people just like them for their work and merchandise and the hope is that they will find those places and the demand for them will grow. Ok, enough ranting, sorry, it's just that crotch shots of teenagers makes me mad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PTIA2n0J0d0Ds1rnUSBX8Q"}
