I always go for the House Special (beef or chicken) and brown rice. Portions were large enough to share, and like most Pick Up Stix locations they will give you extra rice on request. Restaurant was clean, service was quick and friendly. I would definitely go back to this location. It is also conveniently located just off the 5 with easy access to get back onto the freeway.", "business_id": "W0CZaGjV9ud5mKhUGSfDfw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-27", "type": "review"}
