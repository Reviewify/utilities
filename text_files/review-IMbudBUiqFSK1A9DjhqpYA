Portions were large enough to share, and like most Pick Up Stix locations they will give you extra rice on request. Restaurant was clean, service was quick and friendly. I would definitely go back to this location.\n\nIt is also conveniently located just off the 5 with easy access to get back onto the freeway.", "type": "review", "business_id": "W0CZaGjV9ud5mKhUGSfDfw"}
