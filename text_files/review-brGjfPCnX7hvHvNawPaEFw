However, my experience at Smokey Joe's completely warrants one.   For starters, I ordered a Root Beer because the waitress told me the sell it.  They don't.  I instead ordered a Diet Coke that tasted like sugar water and so I sent it back.  The manager told us that he knew there was a problem with the soda, but gave it to me anyway and then charged me for it. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  The entrees came out first.  I had specifically checked to make sure that mine did not come with tomatoes.  I was assured that they didn't.  My wrap came out filled with tomatoes.  When our appetizer came, it was the exact opposite of what we ordered: fried shrimp pot stickers instead of steamed beef.  When we finally got the right app, it was cold after about a minute. They were very apologetic, but again, they still charged me for my drink.  They lumped all three of the items together on the bill, so I don't know if they took anything off, but it was still over $20 for three of the cheaper items on the menu. I will never go back there even though I live within walking distance.  I had heard that this place had a good reputation, but apparently I heard wrong.", "business_id": "-KWel73upKHxstRCr9JGLw", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-08-28", "type": "review"}
