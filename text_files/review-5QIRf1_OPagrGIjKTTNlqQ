Staff is always super friendly while the atmosphere is calm, casual, and inviting. While the food is LA priced, it's my first consideration when I have friends in town for a quick bite. As convenient as it gets for parking in Westwood.\n\nRecommendations: grilled pesto chicken sandwich and pretty much ALL of the pastries and cakes (the fresh strawberry cake and fruit tart are my favorites)", "type": "review", "business_id": "jGHYiK17BNNQxBxMtIBbFQ"}
