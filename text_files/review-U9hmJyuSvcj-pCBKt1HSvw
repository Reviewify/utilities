I've been here twice now during my quarterly visits to C-U. The food, burgers in both instances, has been consistently good. Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network. That having been said... my standards are pretty high... and Crane's, I must say, makes a darn tasty burger! Today I had the special--1/2 burger with mole, roasted chilies, pork shoulder, and chihuahua cheese--oooohhhh yes. Aside from tasty burgers, their beer selection rocks. They literally have one full page of IPAs. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their draft beers (which I believe rotate?) are quality as well. The place is big, their outdoor (alley) seating is great in the summer, and the service is good. Though I must warn you... my first time (in the summer) was during some crayfish special... tables of rowdy bikers cheered on ladies in leather bumping and grinding in their laps. I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't know if it is somehow related to the crayfish, just thought it was worth mentioning.", "business_id": "iZleRh4SOtf4GquA5L8WXw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-17", "type": "review"}
