Mummies was pretty boring. After checking out the Mummies of the World Exhibit, I almost passed out because the movie was so boring. The glasses are poorly made and kept sliding off my face. The theater is roomy, the sound system decent and the 3D awesome. I flinched at some of the things popping out from the screen.", "business_id": "zsCtM2ibksIEQ8ITJwTb3g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-11", "type": "review"}
