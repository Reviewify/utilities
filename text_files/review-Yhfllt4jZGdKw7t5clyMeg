The Urban Tapas experience was perfect for my mature family of 4.  I surprised my family with a cooking class from Tracy and it was the best gift.  She is amazing, comforting, experienced and skilled.  As a family, we bonded like never before with the help of Tracy and her Cashmere recipes.  I felt like we were on a Food Network Show. Totally UNIQUE!!!  Environment: Comforting studio that was very clean and modern Food: OMG... simply amazing...and we (my family) made it!! Experience: 100% Grand!! Price: Affordable This was truly a AMAZING experience with memories to be shared for a long time to come!!   Thanks Tracy!!
