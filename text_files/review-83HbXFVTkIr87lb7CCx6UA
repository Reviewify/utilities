There are lots of great things about this place. First off, and most important, the food is really good! Fresh ingredients that are well made and you get a big portion for what you pay. I've had the Pudgie Elvis and Totally L.A. Both are good. Totally L.A. is a lighter version of pancakes and Pudgie Elvis a heavier, but really good dish. I would recommend both!\n\nOn top of the delicious food, the staff is super nice! They are very friendly and efficient. Not in your face, but are always making sure you have what you need.\n\nThe interior design in this place is so cool. It's very clean and refreshing. You can see it on the walls, in the art and even in the dishes.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BonZ748EKm8pwtVQalFpYQ"}
