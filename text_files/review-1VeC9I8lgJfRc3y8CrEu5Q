The website is really easy to use, and I was able to reserve an appointment without even talking to anyone.\n\nThe salon's design is really inviting, and the private waxing room (with a comfy table) was really relaxing and put me at ease. I didn't have to wait more than two minutes after checking in for Michelle to meet with me.\n\nThough she's very thorough, Michelle works very quickly, so I didn't have too much time to get psyched up for the next strip or focus on any pain.\n\nMy results were fantastic, and I've already been back for another great maintenance appointment!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HUefMvGtGt4Pz9f66apA-w"}
