I was here recently with the fam and we sat outside by the the table fire pit things (not sure what they're called). The ambiance is actually really nice but the service, for lack of a better term, sucks cock and balls. It took them a really long time to bring out our orders and upon asking them for the status of our food, they were incredibly rude as if they're doing us a huge favor. If you're staying at the Hyatt and don't have a car for some reason, then I would suggest walking to another venue. Don't waste your time here.", "business_id": "ScojJe95eYA3Ph5zvyonsQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-11-09", "type": "review"}
