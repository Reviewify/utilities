Inspired by Ligaya's review, it was my plan to check out the David Brower Center after lunch at Azerbaijan.  I didn't check out the entire building, just the Salgado exhibit on the ground floor.  I refer you to her excellent review for details of the building's pedigree and provenance.  I just checked their website and the building is open from 10-5 weekdays.  No weekend hours as yet.  I hope eventually there will be. The double doors to the building are wooden and heavy, w/ sturdy vertical wooden handles wrapped at the ends and secured by graceful metal fixtures.  The feeling is of solidity, simplicity and grandeur, all at the same time.  The Salgado exhibit will be on display through January 31, 2010.  I wish it were permanent.  Here's the link:  http://www.browercenter.org/exhibitions/current  The photographs are stunning, beautiful and difficult, of people, landscapes and animals.  I won't attempt to describe them, other than to say they are some of the most powerfully evocative photographs I've ever seen of people working and struggling.  There's a photo of a whale's tale that is close and detailed and next to it one of the leg and foot of a maritime iguana that looks sculpted out of metal.  The man is a master.  Just go see for yourself.  You will be glad you did.  It's serendipitous, but I'm glad it was the subject of my 700th review.", "business_id": "gvBPwcm2PemPGqUWJlN7Pw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-16", "type": "review"}
