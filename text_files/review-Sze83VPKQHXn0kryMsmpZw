It's a wonderful place to come with people you know and meet some cool new people as well.  \n\nThey have a great wine selection and bottled beers too-- for those who are more into the brew that is, but granted it is a \"wine bar\".  They do what they can to please the masses.\n\nMy other all time favorite part of this bar is the outdoor patio on the roof-- it's just perfect!  Warm nights and cool people-- the right kind of combination.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nm9l4-s4IVXm0JfFMZGgdw"}
