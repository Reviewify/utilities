Food so good. Good food good. Caveman Kitchen good food. Try Caveman Kitchen. \n\nOk so it actually took a lot of effort to type in Caveman. Harder than you think.. anywho, I meant what I said! This place is located on Vermont right by the 10 freeway, which may be why not many USC students know about it. Arguably one of my favorite places to eat near campus. The food is great and it's not too far from campus to get your nom on. \n\nI've gotten the Lomo Saltado. This place took my Peruvian food virginity. Thank you, btw. It's a Peruvian dish with rib eye stir fried with onions, tomatoes, fries and rice. It's like an explosion of flavor in your mouth. The green sauce that it comes with also provides a very heated explosion, if you're into that. \n\nI've also gotten the Cave Club sandwich, which is pulled rotisserie chicken with bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. This was also veryyyyyyy good! The chicken is nice and tender. The fries are standard and the chili cheese fries are bomb as well. \n\nI would call in my order for pick up if you want it to-go. There is also a lot of seating at the restaurant if you want to eat at the venue. \n\nUSC STUDENTS GET A DISCOUNT HERE WITH THE DISCOUNT CARD. GET ON IT, TROJANS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "d09ros9QhLRs9EgWbkkvvg"}
