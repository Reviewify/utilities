I got to take a few bites out of my bf's chicken apple dog with horseradish mustard and sauerkraut. The chicken apple dog was juicy and delicious and went nicely well with the pungent horseradish mustard and the sour tasting sauerkraut. I was not hungry enough to get my own but from those few bites made me wanting more! If I ever come back to the area again I'll be sure to get one to myself hehe.", "business_id": "qHmamQPCAKkia9X0uryA8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-23", "type": "review"}
