The server was very polite and pleasant but we had to ask for everything (spoons for coffee, coffee refills, butter for french toast, etc.).  The french toast was nothing special and served with 2 small pieces of bacon.  The corned beef hash had huge chunks of potatoes and small disks of corned beef.  Was really more like home fries with a little corned beef mixed in.  Nice people and the local suppliers with everything made on the premises is a great idea but the presentations need work.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_yHIlwnpDGUyo2qyjtbsHA"}
