I'm a creature of habit so yes, I literally went for 2 weeks straight. Its a pizza place, but I got the small greek salad with grilled chicken. The \"small\" greek salad is pretty big. It comes with a ton of lettuce, olives, cucumbers, onions, grape leaves (yay!), tomatoes, and feta cheese. The salad also comes with a huge pita that they toast for you.  And its only $3.95! With chicken its an extra $3.00. They give you two giant pieces of healthy grilled chicken breast, not greasy or gross. So $6.95 total. A great deal for an awesome salad.  The pizza and other stuff always looked great too, but I stuck to my salad :-P", "business_id": "YgGbeBYxOSmRi6CFn04MoQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-17", "type": "review"}
