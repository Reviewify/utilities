I often go here due to proximity to my customers. However, I have a love hate relationship with this place. Yesterday I had the Front Page News chicken salad. The chicken was completely void of any seasoning at all and was as tuff as leather. The salad itself was not bad however. My customers had the crab cakes that were reported to be very good. However, my other customer had the steak and salad and the steak was over cooked. On other visits I had various burgers ( all not bad) and have tried the fish and chips (Can be very good to very bad). The place can get very busy and loud inside. But they do have a great outdoor patio with a fountain in the middle that is very enjoyable. The service is generally good but I have been here many times that I find myself and my group waiting on the check or refills. Pros: Great patio and semi outdoor bar area. Food can be very good. Cons: Service and food quality very day by day. Very loud and cramped inside. Overall, not a bad place to spend a summer lunch sitting outside while in Mid Town.", "business_id": "8ht957FWOJ4ryhseu8kzDQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-28", "type": "review"}
