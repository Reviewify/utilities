My boyfriend and I stayed here in one of their suites. We checked in at the front desk with Sacha who was incredibly sweet and accomodating. The suite was beautiful with a seperate bedroom and living room area with comfortable couches, both rooms equipped with large, flat screen TVs. Room service was great. We headed down to the bar (Whiskey Blue) around 10p.m., it was a Saturday night. We were with a group of about 10 other people, we told them to come a little early (around 9ish) so they didn't have any trouble getting in. We were able to secure a couch with a table and 2 additional lounge chairs by the dj. One thing I really like about this lounge/bar is that you can have a comfortable place to sit without having to spend $500+ on buying a bottle, which is ridiculous. The music didn't start off great, but by about 11p.m. the dance floor was packed and the music got really good...hip/hop, mash-up, top 40 type stuff...good music to dance to. Our cocktail waitress was ok, it was a busy night so our drinks would sometimes take a little time...I would recommend going straight to the bar to save time. I had initially reserved a cabana by the pool for the next morning...unfortunately my hangover wasn't going to allow me to leave my bed all day...so we had to cancel, they were very accomodating and didn't give us any hassle for cancelling. All in all, we had a W-onderful experience!", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-07-18", "type": "review"}
