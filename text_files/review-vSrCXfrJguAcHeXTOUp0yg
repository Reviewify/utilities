They are just over-hyped, over-priced cupcakes.  C'mon, $3.50 for ONE cupcake?  You can get a dozen from Safeway, just as good.   HOWEVER, they have more selections than Safeway, I agree.  Today, I went in to Sprinkles and said the secret code to get the free cupcake...it was the German chocolate.  I also used the Buy One, Get One Free coupon from Facebook.  So I got the following flavors, and here are my critiques: *German Chocolate: the frosting on top is really good.  It's mocha-tasting frosting is infused with LOTS of coconut and pecans on top of a chocolate cupcake.  Not bad. *Lemon: the white cake is lightly flavored with lemon, and the frosting isn't lemon flavored at all.  It's just white frosting.  Ok.  Could have used some more tart in it.   *S'mores by Blake Lively: There's a graham cracker crust on the bottom, chocolate cake, dark chocolate ganache in the center, topped with a light layer of toasted marshmallow.  The dark chocolate ganache was really hard, and really bitter.  I wish there was more marshmallow topping.  The graham cracker was a surprise.  NOTHING SPECIAL BLAKE LIVELY! *Dark Chocolate: loved it.  It's just like how a chocolate cupcake should be.  Moist, and not too much frosting.  I also loved the little chocolate sprinkles on top of the frosting.   IT'S OKAY, GUYS.  Nothing to go back for, really.  You can go home and make better ones, in my opinion.  I would only go back if I were in the area, and I knew the secret code for a free one.  that's it. Okay, okay, I appreciate that they give out cupcakes everyday and have that promotion for buy one, get one free.  Thanks Sprinkles, but your cupcakes are still overpriced and mediocre.  :P", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-01-29", "type": "review"}
