Slo needed a donut place so thanks for fulfilling my fat girl fantasies! There are some pretty interesting options- I like how theyre trying to be inventive and creative! They are also priced well, although some of their drinks are a bit expensive imo. I've come here multiple times looking for a study spot but honestly, the chairs are really uncomforable and the lighting isn't very good. Also the smell of donuts made me want to vomit after hour 4.... Not a good study spot, but def a good spot to get your fatty donut fix.", "business_id": "0P3XlWr4UQYR7jwdt9sDCA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-21", "type": "review"}
