But because I am from New Jersey and lived in NYC for a bulk of my life, I am always ready to try whatever it is that they say is New York Style and have become conditioned to feel let down afterwards. I had their chicken parm sub today and it was very good. The bread was crusty and pretty authentic for Cali. The Chicken was crispy and good. Being they are only a 1/2 block from my office, I am happy that there is something close by that is that good. Also, the fact that it is not in the mad crush of lunchtime on Bancroft/Durant/Telegraph it would get me there without it even being as good as it is, because the intense Berkeley crowds at lunch make me normally consider skipping lunch altogether. It was also very quick, because if they said New York Style and then took forever to make the sandwich they would have lost me. Good job guys!", "business_id": "JwvmZ3QET0ZgYykhiZb41g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-17", "type": "review"}
