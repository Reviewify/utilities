I've never actually set foot in the location and I order online from their website, so I can't speak for the service there, but the site is easy to deal with and my food always arrives in a decent amount of time, and hot. Points for that. There are certain things to order here that are always terrific. My favorite is the monterey chicken. I also have a lot of love for the mac & cheese bites. The salads, however... well one time, I ordered a chicken ceasar with extra chicken, and was charged something like $4 extra for less than a chicken breast's worth on an already weak salad. Tonight, I ordered chili cheese fries, never imagining that anyone in the land where queso is an art form would serve me nasty liquid cheese #5 from a can. The \"chili\" was no better. Live and learn, I guess. Being able to have someone bring me food until 4am is huge, though, even if the quality of that food can be hit or miss.", "business_id": "UQMRJIM_X5ZvW31GTvkagw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}
