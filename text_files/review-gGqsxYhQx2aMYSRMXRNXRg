My partner and I recently stayed a night in Ithaca passing through the Finger Lakes wine country, and decided to go the B&B route rather than traditional chain hotel. What a good decision.\n\nThe room (The LIbrary) was gorgeous and charming. The bed was super comfy. The private bath was a brilliant layout - split into two rooms, one for shower and a separate room for vanity & toilet.\n\nThe breakfast, cooked by Innkeeper Dave, was amazing, and easily rivaled anything we could have obtained in an outside restaurant. And the nightly sideboard of desserts and coffee/teas were the perfect end to our day of car travel into Ithaca.\n\nThe location is perfect, mere steps away from all the shopping & dining options in/around the Ithaca Commons.\n\nOver breakfast in the dining room, we met another vacationing couple on a road-trip from Ottawa, Ontario, who were also doing the wine country jaunt around the lakes. We ran into them again at one of the wineries (small world, eh?), and were able to point them to some new wines to try!\n\nIf ever we are headed near Ithaca again, the Miller Inn will be in our sights.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2xOXboOQJfxoagBqrLXO_g"}
