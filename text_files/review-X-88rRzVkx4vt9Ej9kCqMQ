I've always been a fan of ice cream sandwiches and I like that you can customize it any way you like. Pick any two freshly baked cookies and any flavor ice cream for the low, low price of $2!

Sooooo good!", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-26", "type": "review"}
