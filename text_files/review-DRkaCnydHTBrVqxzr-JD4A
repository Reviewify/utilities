The ambiance here is like a Home Depot that serves food. Shrimp is offered in the buffet next to the lemon tarts, which is next to the Hot and Vile Soup. There was one beef dish that was tasty, but it did not make up for the General Tso's Chicken that one dining companion described as \"horrific.\" Don't waste your money here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ulgAMrHx6FFvDUMrLInDw"}
