I always thought it an unusual name for a place so I was curious to attend a show here. I was surprised to find it's right next to the Middle East (another venue I had heard of before moving to Boston). It's also a lot smaller than I imagined, but for the type of bands that play there, it makes for a cozy location, although with enough room that you can still bring the mosh if need be (which you shouldn't because TT's doesn't like that kind of thing). I haven't drank much there beyond the cheap PBR but the sound at the shows I've been to has been solid. So yeah...the moral of the story is: stay out of my stuff!", "business_id": "t2xsi7qIN0iwGiOyCn7k8Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-01-16", "type": "review"}
