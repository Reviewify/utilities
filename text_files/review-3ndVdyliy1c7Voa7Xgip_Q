This place turned out to be a bit surprisingly good for the price. We had to come down to SLO for an emergency last minute trip and found it on yelp. It had some of the better reviews for the price we were looking for so called them up and for $89, on a Tuesday night we got a room with two Queen beds. When we called the guy on the phone was very friendly and helpful as we needed something close to the hospital (dad had a motorcycle accident) he began trying to see how he could make sure the room would accommodate us if we were bringing my dad back with us. Wanted to make sure he got us a room with good accessibility etc. We arrived at about 11pm and the guy behind the counter was NOT the person we spoke with. Still pleasant but not much personality. The room was clean, fully loaded with the type of amenities you can get in places like this. Microwave, fridge, iron, ironing board, blower, fridge, tv with HBO. The sink/mirror area just outside the bathroom was all updated with granite counter and new fixtures. Also had a nice (yet very small) continental breakfast. Coffee, juice some pastries. The only real problem was the bathroom. Although never felt \"dirty\" while using it, the shower could use some updating or at least new grout in a few spots. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't need five star accommodations but want a clean room with conveniences.", "business_id": "MUgtAiJ5MhRrWlqPG7LURw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-21", "type": "review"}
