I've been going there for at least seven years and I've never had a complaint. First I started with one of the Japanese hairstylists who did wonders with my hair when I had no idea what to do with it. Then years later I wanted to see what everyone was talking about with Anna- and I've never turned back. She takes the time and effort to make your hair look as great as possible. Her execution is amazing and though I've been getting the same haircut every time (a short layered bob- why get rid of a good thing?), my friends always love its versatility and how nice it looks even when it's a bit grown out. It is cash only so be sure to go to the ATM beforehand.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2rz3Yjnx5tWy8rg0za-1Nw"}
