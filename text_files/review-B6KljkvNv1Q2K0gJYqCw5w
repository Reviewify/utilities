More for their clothes than boards though. His style and favorites change a lot. 510 usually has the current biggest thing in boards and apparel. On more than a few occasions my son has found the very latest style of a new skate shoe. Most recently it was a style of Adidas shoe. They also carry Pink Dolphin which is still mainly sold online or at Odd Future shows.\n\n Unfortunately they rarely have sales and not very good discounts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FNPnWopqYARkb6pg6qOwww"}
