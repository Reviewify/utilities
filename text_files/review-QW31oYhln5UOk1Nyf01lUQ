I'm not exactly sure what happened. Maybe I've changed. Maybe living in CA made me more of a food snob. Especially when it comes to sushi. That said, I can't even tell you how disappointed I am at how much this restaurant has gone down hill. I think this place needs a complete revamp, including the menu. What used to be cute and trendy back in the day, is just now downright annoying. The drinks named after colors? I'm over it. I don't think the menu has changed one bit since it opened. We sat at the sushi bar, because it was pretty crowded and I didn't figure we would have a chance at getting a table. The sushi on the belt was very vanilla. Typical most ordered sushi and it was very bland, and stale. No pow at all. My husband and I ordered appetizers as our meals, because we figured we'd grab a few things off the belt. My \"dinner\" of crab spring rolls, took about 45 minutes. For spring rolls. When asking our server what the hold up was, she just kind of shrugged and said \"that's weird, I mean, it was ordered\" and then went on her merry way, as if to subliminally tell me that it wasn't her problem anymore. I get that it's a hopping place and that we're one of the chosen few who is lucky to grace us with your presence by working here, but get over yourself and fetch my dinner. I felt like that surreal scene in Garden State where Zach Braff arrives at his job. Bottom line: Pod is a total has been restaurant. And if you need any more proof of that, just check out the woman next to you, who is probably drinking her colored martini out of a straw.", "business_id": "3gVSrS4kffGGZT8oXHsIcw", "stars": 2, "date": "2007-10-16", "type": "review"}
