And really, what could be better than eating some Drunken Noodle from No Thai after a night of drunken debauchery? It was just as good as I remembered. Can't believe it's been 5 years since No Thai first infiltrated Ann Arbor (harhar I kid), a true testament to their success. Not to mention, they now have 3 locations on UM campus! I'm really not sure why so many people are critical of No Thai. Why criticize it for its lack of authenticity when it's not claiming to be an authentic Thai restaurant? I mean, do you hate on Za's or Noodles & Co. for not being authentic Italian? Come on, people!! Get with it and lighten up!  Give it a shot - it's yummy in the tummy. :)", "business_id": "wBXqzfWpx5MKaP33vxH0CA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-10-20", "type": "review"}
