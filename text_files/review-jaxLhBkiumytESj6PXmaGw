I walked upstairs with my crew and saw an open table. We begin to sit down and a waitress who I didn't know came up to me and said that the table we wanted was reserved for a party of ten. Since when did my favorite neighborhood bar take reservations??? So I saw Robin behind the bar and asked her if my friends and I could have the table. We had to wait a few minutes before it was handed over to us, but it's nice to know that I am still known at the bar I used to go to on a weekly basis and I could get a table. We had a round of double burgers and PBR's while the party of 10 Harvard girls stood awkwardly next to us at the entrance of the second floor waiting for a table to open up. Sometimes it pays to be a townie.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uKB1eXRNNBq2w4-wUkusZA"}
