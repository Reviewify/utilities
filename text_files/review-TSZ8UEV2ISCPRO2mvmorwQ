The staff is friendly and provide excellent customer service.  The Men's selection tends to be better than the Women's in general, but I have found a few great pairs of shoes here.  On several occasions they haven't had my size in a shoe but didn't seem to be receiving restock in them anytime soon. However, I do check this place out almost anytime I'm on Telegraph Ave.  Never know what you might find.", "business_id": "brIrK8rlGDyptm8Y-DU5Jg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-18", "type": "review"}
