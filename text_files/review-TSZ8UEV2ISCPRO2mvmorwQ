The Men's selection tends to be better than the Women's in general, but I have found a few great pairs of shoes here. \n\nOn several occasions they haven't had my size in a shoe but didn't seem to be receiving restock in them anytime soon.\n\nHowever, I do check this place out almost anytime I'm on Telegraph Ave.  Never know what you might find.", "type": "review", "business_id": "brIrK8rlGDyptm8Y-DU5Jg"}
