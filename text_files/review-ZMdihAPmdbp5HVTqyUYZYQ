There are a lot more Chinese-style dishes on the menu now. That being said, the person who thought of the \"M3\" dish is my new hero. It's a spicy chicken and veggie stir fry with GYOZA in it. YUM!!! Yes, it's wrong in so many ways, but gyoza is good and stir fry is good so let's break the rules and put 'em together. I saw on other reviews that people think the place is dingy. Eh - it doesn't seem any worse to me than 99% of the other places on the Ave. That being said, I usually get takeout.", "business_id": "U1JuxM8LkrntNpiDntMtzw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-14", "type": "review"}
