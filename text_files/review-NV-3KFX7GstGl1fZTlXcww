I wasn't all that hungry so I ordered 1 Beef skewer ($6.50) cooked medium rare.  It came with 4 pieces of beef on a skewer served on top of a warm tortilla, apricot chutney, and lettuce/onion garnish.  The apricot chutney was delightfully sweet and when paired with the savory beef, tasted pretty darn well! Who would've thunk?  Price is definitely steep for what it is, so I won't be getting it again, but I have been left with new inspiration for preparing/cooking beef =) My friend ordered the chicken sandwich ($9) with spicy habaneros mango mustard with potato sides.  The mustard reminded me more of a spicy curry/coriander paste for some reason.  It's a pretty good sandwich, but pricey as well.  I'd rather go to Bartley's in Harvard square for a real burger. Ambiance/vibe? Reaffirmed my opinions. Miracle of Science is def a place to hit up for a drink, not so much of a place to enjoy a sit-down meal.
