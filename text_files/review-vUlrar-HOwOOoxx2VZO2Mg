This is the 4th time I have ordered delivery and they call me and ask me to come downstairs and pick it up. That is not delivery! Their drivers had the gall to argue with me on the phone about delivery being too difficult for my building!! I order Chinese food, pizza, and other foods/services with no problems. This is a problem with Mr. Noodle directly. The drivers are lazy and claim they cannot find parking.  When the driver started arguing with me, I called into the restaurant itself. I asked to speak with a manager. The person on the phone said their name was J.J. and claimed he was a manager. When I explained the situation, the manager started giving me the same excuses as the driver!!!! ~ So since the food is not delivered, I went into the restaurant to be sure my credit card was not charged. (On my way, I saw 3 clear parking spaces in front of my building.) At the restaurant, I spoke with J.J. who gave me the same lame excuses as the driver. Infuriating. Save your time and hassle, and try some of Mr. Noodle's competitors in Westwood- Emporium Thai (http://www.ethaicuisine.com/contact.htm) or Thai Fresh (www.grubhub.com/thai-fresh). Mr. Noodle has gone downhill, and will not receive any more of my business until they acknowledge this.", "business_id": "1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-11", "type": "review"}
