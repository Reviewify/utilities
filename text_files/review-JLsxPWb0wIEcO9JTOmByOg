Except...... The shakes at this location are AWFUL. I love me a Neapolitan shake, but I don't enjoy the COMPLETELY MELTED thin ice cream goop I always manage to get here instead of my shakes! One time I even complained and asked for a new one, thinking maybe my shake had been sitting out for a while as I was stuck in the drive-thru line, but my new shake ended up being just as melted and yuck. The shakes at every other location I've been to have been great. Other than that, the burgers & fries are so darn GOOOOD!", "business_id": "tIIof6-zqlgxImFNDEIj9g", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-22", "type": "review"}
