I've put off writing this review for some time, but after having had East Dumpling about every week for the past two months (despite some initial disappointment), I am happy to say that this has become my go-to dumpling delivery joint. In terms of value, it's tough to find something that comes close: 12 dumplings for 6.95, and about 8 are a full meal. So for about $5 you can get your noodle-wrapped meat-fix without having to do any cooking. Most Chinese places in the area--and in general--overcharge for their dumplings (many charge about the same price for half as much), and the ones that don't deliver the hot-dog equivalent of a dumpling: unseasoned ground meat parts with soy sauce. While East Dumpling is definitely not the best dumpling I've ever had, it's above average, and probably the best combination of price/quality in the area. The chicken/green pepper dumpling is unique, and livens up the otherwise standard fare but well executed dumpling options. They use a fair amount of ginger in their filling, which I don't think I've had much, but it makes them sometimes feel a bit one-note in terms of flavor: with the exception of the chicken and green paper dumplings they sort of all taste the same. Overall, a fine if unspectacular addition to delivery routine.", "business_id": "CWk6yFOoKJH5URub5XsHDg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-06", "type": "review"}
