They did a good job at packing as many wines in as possible but it's more / less a large closet.\n\nI found the staff to be very annoying. One woman continued to offer a sample wine tasting until I finally said yes to get her to stop.\n\nThe other staff member was obnoxious! He is the type of person who can't sit still, stop talking for 60 seconds. He clearly had to make a point that he was the resident wine expert and could tell me tons of interesting facts. Instead of having a nice experience, I felt as though I was chased around their 150sqft store being told the history of each wine and for some reason, the history of Princeton.\n\nWhen I say \"I'm just looking\" that means I do not want your input. Let me just shop and pick a bottle. You might want to try laying off a bit, and consider that your customers really don't care for your input unless they ask.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f8_Cxle2iRAGnDlwwFM-xw"}
