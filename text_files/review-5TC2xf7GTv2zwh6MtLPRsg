I later learned that behind this pun was the owner's genuine appreciation for jazz, which plays all day long in this restaurant, and after whose musical terms and legends many of the dishes are named. So I was initially charmed. But the food, which is extravagantly good, elevated Thelonious Monkfish from a mere curiosity to an object of my affection. Devotion, really. I've had a couple of their entrees and enjoyed them very much; I can also attest that the curry fries and the cranberry crab rangoon are just lovely. I appreciate a restaurant that seems to take so much care with its menu options. I am a sushi novice, but I am falling pretty hard for the clever and cleverly-named maki rolls. A good example of their creative take on sushi is the Yardbird roll, which contains tempura chicken instead of fish -- surprising, delicious, and one of my favorite things on the menu... along with my ten or twelve other favorite things on the menu. (One note: I encountered slow service during one meal within the first couple weeks of their opening, but I think this is forgivable given the growing pains of a new restaurant -- and though things were slow that night, the servers were polite and apologetic. On all other occasions, service has been prompt and courteous, so I'm willing to chalk that occasion up to a fluke.)", "business_id": "H_XBx4erPI4IrUo8WySPLg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-03", "type": "review"}
