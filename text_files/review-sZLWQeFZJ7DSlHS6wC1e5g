It was a very relaxed bar scene for a saturday night, nice interior, not too cramped feeling. We sat down for a couple beers to find that they had a fairly extensive menu (no natty ice or keystone insight... sorry college boys). I ended up getting hard cider which was very good and fit with my autumn mood (they had several different choices of cider as well) We decided to get the spinach and artichoke app. When it arrived, I was pleased to find that it was a step above the freezer section applebees variety and was served with pita chips. It was a great snack and very tasty... until I started chewing on something that sort of felt like an eggshell. Come to find that the ceramic bowl that it was served in was chipped. Low and behold I pull a piece of ceramic out of my mouth... yum! Now I've only been there once so I can't really say that they serve their food with broken bits of ceramic to all of their patrons but I didn't really appreciate it. Aside from that minor incident, the service was decent for a fairly busy night. I would probably go there again", "business_id": "eM8d9dpDiVvMrJrWwIRAVw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-23", "type": "review"}
