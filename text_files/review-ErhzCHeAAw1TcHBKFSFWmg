When you wanted decent food after midnight (but before sunrise) in College Park... Plato's was among the only options.  And it probably wouldn't kill you.  \n\nThe diner has changed hands a few times over the last ten years, and undergone a series of changes that are wholly for the better.  It's cleaned up a lot, and been decorated with murals of Greece, gods, statuary, mythology, etc.  It's still a bit tattered (and sometimes we are seated in the booth with the torn seats and the missing light), but it's good for four things - breakfast, Greek food, burgers, and dessert.  If you're contemplating something on the menu that doesn't fall into those categories, don't do it.  Save yourself the heartache (and heartburn).\n\nBreakfast is standard diner fare.  They have homefries instead of hashbrowns.  Omelettes are huge, and their pancakes have that fluffy texture that I can never duplicate at home.  The Greek menu is excellent, and they offer a number of special Greek dishes every Thursday.  I love their spanakopita and the \"vegetarian delight\" salad (with falafel).  They do good burgers and fries (seasoned with Old Bay).  And like any respectable diner, they have a wide selection of shakes, pies, cakes, and other desserts.  Oh, and if you want an appetizer - try the hobo fries!  French fries with melted cheese and gravy, sure to clog your arteries as they worm their way into your heart.\n\nIgnore the blue plate specials and never order the pasta.  Don't expect anything fancy on their beer and wine menu.  But if you stick to the staples, you won't be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zpRlUtFn6aWRH4YDDuv1BQ"}
