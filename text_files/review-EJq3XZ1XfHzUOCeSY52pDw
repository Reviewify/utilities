Now that I've been at MIT for 5 years and tried a variety of their offerings, I can say that... well, I'm still baffled by it. It's wildly popular, people swear by it, but I just don't get it. It's not that they're horrible-- most things I've gotten have been at least serviceable. But it's certainly not the level of no frills tastiness that I expect from a truck. That said, there are two exceptions: I will actually wait in the long line for their goi cuon and the ga nuong. I think the lesson is stick with the vietnamese (though not their banh mi, if they even still have that-- the bread was inedibly tough) They used to have good and spicy green papaya salad from time to time, too, but I haven't seen that in ages.", "business_id": "GiSHio-nOL7eULwMxtoATw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-06-09", "type": "review"}
