The crust look a week old, the sauce was gross, the cheese appeared translucent and the sausage looked like dog food. I ate one piece and physically couldn't stomach the rest, it's just that disgusting. I don't understand how this place is in business; it's more expensive than low-quality chains like little ceaser', but it's pizza is so much grosser than even cheaper places. Do not go here under any circumstances!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bxXX4CxK2lbDH_v9c8uQaw"}
