I sublet from a student at U Penn. When I moved out they kept about half my security deposit for bogus reasons. It would be one thing if the girl I was subletting from had trashed the apartment or something. But the stated reason was along the lines of \"excessive cleaning needed.\" Which wasn't the case. If I was smart I would have taken before and after pictures, and made sure I did a final walk through with the landlord. Something to consider if dealing with Urban & Bye.", "business_id": "vAWxyiJuTrWsoX92GCvclg", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-09-03", "type": "review"}
