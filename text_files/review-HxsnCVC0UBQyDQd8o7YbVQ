So after work I went up to 125th and came across  Unity. \n\nOne of the women outside took me up to the shop and asked me what I wanted. I told her box braids and showed her the size, then she asked me how much.  I don't really get braids that often so I  didn't quit no the going rate, but luckily one of my friends told me she usually pays $65 for micros. \n\nSince I wanted bigger braids I told the lady I wanted to pay $45 knowing this price wouldn't fly, she haggled with me until we decided on $55 for some braids.  Gotta love haggling.\n\nSo since I came in at 6 pm a lot of the women looked like they wanted to go home. Luckily there were 3 people braiding my hair ( 4 at one point) so it only took 2 hours for me to get my hair did #holla. \n\nWhile getting my hair done I peeped a lot of the other styles being done and everyone's hair looked fly. I did notice that one women paid $55 for cornrows into a bun, so make sure you bust out your negotiating skills to get a good price. \n\nDidn't see any roaches or bugs in here, but the place definitely could be touched by some Lysol. \n\nOverall though getting my hair done here was a pleasant ( as braids can be) experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CYr_ln80SyS1B6Equ1qHUg"}
