I've been to other gyms and it's loaded with equipment. They have an indoor track for running on the third level. The main level has a BIIIIIIIIG TV several basketball courts and various cardio machines. The second floor has basketball courts. And the basement has the locker rooms and weight room and swimming pool. I enjoy coming here. There are few people in the morning and evening. It gets packed here around 3:45-8pm. And it's very convenient for students. I think it's expensive for membership for the general public though.. I'm not sure.  Ohhh and a good amount of the cardio machines have televisions to keep you occupied while running!", "business_id": "7XyhkkFGSzFNMe6uppsyHQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-28", "type": "review"}
