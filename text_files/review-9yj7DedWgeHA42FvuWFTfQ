I called to make sure they delivered in our area and was assured by the friendly associate that they did for a fee of $2.00.  There website allowed us to place our order on easy quick, fast and in a hurry.  I even liked the fact the driver called to confirm the address to ensure our food was delivered in a timely manner.  The food arrived very quick and fresh.  The driver even took a few minutes to explain their loyalty process.   Everyone who placed an order was very pleased with their fresh hot food. This place definitely has a new home in the menu folder!", "business_id": "pDtV_4dxKqOOwPqyAMDhYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-20", "type": "review"}
