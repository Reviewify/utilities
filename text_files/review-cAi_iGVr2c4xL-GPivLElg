This place is a BIG disappointment.  I can't recall if I had enjoyed any of their dishes.  Customer service is poor.  I felt rushed to order soon as I sat down.

Their lunch special, the Mills lunchbox is ok for the price.", "business_id": "DgHEzcSBotbfxW-IJPAMuQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-10-14", "type": "review"}
