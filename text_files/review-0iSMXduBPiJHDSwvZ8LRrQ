When I came in they were not too busy and no line to speak of. I was handed a plastic menu which had a variety of salads and sandwiches. I decided to order the 1/2 soup and 1/2 salad, where I got the corn chowder and the market salad with chicken. The food was done very quickly less than 5 minutes. When I got back to the hotel, I saw that the salad was very haphazardly made, and it looked like they just kind of threw things on a plate so it wasn't visually pleasing but eh... as long as it tasted okay I didn't care. The salad was good, nothing too special. The fruit was pretty fresh The chicken was nice and warm and tender. The soup was a bit too seasoned that you loose the underlying flavor.  Overall the food was okay, nothing too special but it was quick for those that don't have time to wait.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AWsOwlorVHRSpgPJy1I0eg"}
