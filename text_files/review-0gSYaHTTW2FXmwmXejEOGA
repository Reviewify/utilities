It's only fair. On the contrary, I would never give it 1 star unless some bitch or douche got on my nerves and made my tummy rumble rumble because I lost my appetite... has happened, but very rare.\n\nAnyways, I never fell in love with Mexican food or thought that I would, but after dining at this Acapulco Restaurant, I changed... I have dined here a few times (all for lunch), and the food and service haven't disappointed me yet.\n\nThe location is hard to find because it's slightly hidden. There's several metered parking outside and plenty of valets nearby. It's Westwood, so don't be a cheapo and expect freepo. Speaking of which, expect to spend over 15 bucks per person... You'll know what I mean if you look at the menu. I usually order their grilled shrimp and grilled steak fajitas and I think you'll love them too! Ok, so I'm not a chef and don't plan to be one either, but don't forget to ask for olive oil if you order the fajitas; they make the perfect dipping sauce. And remember to grab a margarita :) My favorite is the mango one. So back to what I was saying about location... Westwood, in general, is relaxing and very laid back, so it makes the whole dining experience better/ tastier (no matter which restaurant), or at least in my opinion.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3ig_tq9MqJyMiOUI-6kuTA"}
