The Bad His bedside manner lacks severely if you question him about anything. He will take it personally. Full Review Long story short: After admitting my hubby to the hospital for treatment of his NDPH, I questioned Dr. Mathew on the amount of Topamax he had raised my husbands dosage overnight. I was berated for questioning him and made to feel like I was to blame for his headache. My husband ended up getting 2 kidney stones and was immediately pulled off the Topamax 2 days after my questioning him. He may be good at treating some headaches, but he needs 2 lessons: 1) in US culture (yes women are allowed to ask questions here) and 2) bedside manner. Unfortunately my husband had to suffer for many days with the kidney stones, probably caused by the Topamax. Shame on you Dr. Mathew. He's since been fired as my hubby's neurologist.", "business_id": "_ca5aBGIxqq-BBkuFACQUw", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-01-05", "type": "review"}
