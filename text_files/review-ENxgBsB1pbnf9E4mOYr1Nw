It constantly reminds you of sanctuary, a building filled with warmth and life, despite how barren and cold Troy can be. You can't help and wonder how inviting this place can be.\n\nYes their food is a little expensive, but I can't help but put my hand on the fact that this is the only place that is open in the middle of night providing great service and good food that other diners struggle to do even in the afternoon.\n\nSo, it's 1AM and you're deciding between Denny's and the 76 Diner. Your pick.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OjczqLl-q-NQ2oyvWUMagw"}
