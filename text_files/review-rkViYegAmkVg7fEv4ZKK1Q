Sometimes, I order (very tasty) 3-bean chili and only watch while my ogre of a husband ends his twenties snarfing burgers with seeming disregard for the consequences. But on the rare occasion, I take a bite of said burger and am so moved by the combination of well-seasoned, juicy beef in a perfectly crisped Kaiser roll that I am momentarily cured of my delusion and so out-snarf the boy that he needs to either order a second burger or make-due with whatever legume concoction I initially picked out.  Perhaps you could call that a miracle? While the Miracle of Science does have an interesting looking menu (laid out on the periodic table), why would you ever order anything but one of those amazing hamburgers with its delicious chunky side of home-fries?  They also have what seems to be a great selection of beers (I think they are much more well known for this than for their food), but I cannot comment as I'm no beer lover.  In the warm weather the big windows in the restaurant open up and you can sit facing out onto the summer street scene enjoying a leisurely drink or a meal with friends.  It's one of the most relaxing places I've found in Boston  :-)", "business_id": "7MN8kNyuKDZtoSoVdZDCpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-12", "type": "review"}
