Service is quick and friendly. I was annoyed one time when I was waiting a few minutes for a friend, and someone approached me to tell me that i had to order something to stay. i was a fairly regular customer and i was waiting for my friend before ordering, not good customer service, i know that girl recognized me, so i was annoyed. other then that, ive enjoyed it there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8jFq7v5S_qQeEmN-DHxkSQ"}
