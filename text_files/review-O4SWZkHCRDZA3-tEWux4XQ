My parents and I got in for a combined $16, which is almost the cost of a ticket at, say, Mann's Chinese. Don't expect to much by way of decor. The Regency looks as though it were plucked from some older Stephen King story--think \"The Langoliers\", where the protagonists, riding on a commercial airplane, fly through a tear in the fabric of space-time and are transported to yesterday--not exactly time travel, but rather a landscape devoid of all life that lies silent and calm until devoured by swarms of little beasts. Given the general atmosphere of the place, my mom refused to sit in our theater until five minutes before showtime--she was afraid that we'd get mugged or worse in our seats if we sat there alone. Whenever I go there, I feel sorry for the one or two clerks manning the ticket line / concession stand. They stand around for most of the night, waiting for a few scores of people to trickle in and out, eating stale popcorn and drinking watery coffee, clutching their ersatz movie tickets. Nonetheless, this place is THE best local theater for independent or limited-release films, in addition to movies just past prime. For instance, my friends and I saw \"Shortbus,\" the risque movie (from the director of \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\") that explores alternative and deviant sexuality. We also later saw \"God Grew Tired of Us,\" which is a movie on the Lost Boys of Sudan. The seats aren't especially comfortable, the screens are small, and the concessions are mediocre, but the quality and selection of the movies and the dirt-cheap prices more than make up for its deficiencies. Check it out if you want to catch a better movie than, say, \"Shooter\" (though I have to admit that Mr. Wahlberg was excellent in \"The Departed!).", "business_id": "iY1sa6KDfSDg4yHwwGonrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-04-12", "type": "review"}
