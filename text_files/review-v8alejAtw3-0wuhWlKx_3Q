My boyfriend and I are lactose-intolerant, so we were really pleased that they offer soy cheese.  As far as toppings go, they've got an abundance - caramelized onions, lime chicken, salami, artichoke hearts, italian sausage, etc.\n\nTASTE: 4.6/5.  Pretty darn good.  Soy cheese is decent - different from regular cheese, but very edible.  Toppings were tasty as well.  I thought the crust (we got whole wheat) was on the hard/crispy side, which my jaw did not appreciate.\n\nSERVICE: 1/5.  Jesus.  My boyfriend called in saying he had a coupon for \"buy a 14 inch pizza, get a 10 inch pizza free\".  He said, \"Do I need to go home and get the coupon?\"  and they said \"Yeah, you have to bring it in for record-keeping.\"  He goes home, gets the coupon, goes to pick up the pizza... and it turns out they have a deal every f***ing Tuesday - \"buy a 14 inch pizza, get another 14 inch pizza free!\"  AND THE PERSON ON THE PHONE DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE NICE TO TELL HIM THIS?  Jesus Christ.  Argument ensued and she made a bunch of excuses... what a pile of crap.  Anyway.  I'm kind of bitter about this whole incident, but to be totally honest with you, I will be back eventually to satiate my pizza cravings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "MPOLq2K771xngu7_CjXKQA"}
