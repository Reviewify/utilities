This place is absolutely 100% off the chain. I had passed by it a couple of times and thought \" that looks nice.\" Well it was all that and more. The best part is the self serve aspect of everything from the yogurt to the toppings. they have cups by the machines, and the toppings are just in bins with spoons by the register. the price is also sweet at $0.39 per oz. so about $6.30 per lb. The flavors!! They had 12 flavors ( two were out of order, i think it was pineapple and some other fruit.) Among the favorites were green tea, pumpkin bread, taro something or other, and cheesecake. Not only was everything tasty, it was all 1% fat or fat free( sinless desserts!) But the topping bar is fully stocked too. The first part is all fruits( good selection!) and then next section is all the stuff that makes it just a little harder to tell your self its good for you (chocolate, assorted crushed candies, cinnamon toast crunch!) Do yourself a favor and go down here and get some dang delicious yogurt.", "business_id": "oHVanLow3Tm7xvuo6Hkt0Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-03", "type": "review"}
