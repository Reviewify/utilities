Piatti definitely fit the bill on all fronts.\n\nThe food was, if not completely authentic Italian, still really good.  She had their sopressatta pizza, which was a combo of briny, spicy salame and sweet chilis.  The sweet-spicy combo really was nice, and the thin, chewy crust had a nice brick-oveny smokiness.  (She did find it a bit heavy on the cheese, but I thought it wasn't too bad.)\n\nI had the chicken parmigiana, with bucatini (hollow spaghetti) because ... well, I really like chicken parmigiana.  The chicken was cooked nicely (though, i wish they had pounded it out flat), and the bucatini was cooked al dente.  My only wish is that there'd be a bit less mozzarella on top, and that the tomato sauce be a bit fresher (perhaps more crushed tomato, and less tomato paste, which I detest?).  A sidecar from the bar kept my tummy warm.\n\nI also appreciated the service -- not overly fawning or necessarily friendly, but professional and attentive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UR4o1izRUVX5WanCXW8S7A"}
