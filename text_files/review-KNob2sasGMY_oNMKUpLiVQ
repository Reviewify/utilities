(she did find it a bit heavy on the cheese, but i thought it wasn't too bad.) i had the chicken parmigiana, with bucatini (hollow spaghetti) because ... well, i really like chicken parmigiana. the chicken was cooked nicely (though, i wish they had pounded it out flat), and the bucatini was cooked al dente. my only wish is that there'd be a bit less mozzarella on top, and that the tomato sauce be a bit fresher (perhaps more crushed tomato, and less tomato paste, which i detest?). a sidecar from the bar kept my tummy warm. i also appreciated the service -- not overly fawning or necessarily friendly, but professional and attentive.", "business_id": "UR4o1izRUVX5WanCXW8S7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-06-28", "type": "review"}
