The maltagliati with ricotta  and spinach is always a success ( addicted to this dish). Their dinner specials are always perfectly executed and delicious. \n\n We went brunch just recently when the weather was nice and found the best lemon ricotta pancakes ever....talk about light and fluffy and full of flavor I am salivating writing about it.\n\nThe service is always good even when they are swamped which is often and the food comes out hot and as advertised.\n\nThe  wine selection is good.\n\nThe only thing I can say that isn't 100% positive is they took off the menu the crushed capers in olive oil which was one of the cities tastiest.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wZkZmjZEJDraLJgAalnHvA"}
