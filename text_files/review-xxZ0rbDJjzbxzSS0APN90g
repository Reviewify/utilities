We usually eat there for dinner as they serve one of the best lamb ragouts in NYC. The maltagliati with ricotta  and spinach is always a success ( addicted to this dish). Their dinner specials are always perfectly executed and delicious.   We went brunch just recently when the weather was nice and found the best lemon ricotta pancakes ever....talk about light and fluffy and full of flavor I am salivating writing about it. The service is always good even when they are swamped which is often and the food comes out hot and as advertised. The  wine selection is good. The only thing I can say that isn't 100% positive is they took off the menu the crushed capers in olive oil which was one of the cities tastiest.", "business_id": "wZkZmjZEJDraLJgAalnHvA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-17", "type": "review"}
