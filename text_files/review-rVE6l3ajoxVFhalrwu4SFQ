If you like seasoned pork try anything with al pastor, they cut it right from the caroussel they have there. I can honestly say that I have not tried anything else of so good that their al pastor is, I don't even bother to try anything else of so good that it is. They have multiple condiments you can choose from too. Carrot, cilantro wit h onion, lime and like 5 different salsas that are self serve. Very good place. And also drinks like horchata.", "business_id": "Ckjlcv3mOPnCosSEPb4tmg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-06", "type": "review"}
