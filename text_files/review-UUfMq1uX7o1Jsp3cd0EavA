The stores that are here are high end, but that's all it offers. It's just a mall in the end. You've got to be ready to buy something if you are coming here, as it doesn't really lend to \"just hanging out.\" I suppose most malls are this way, but having been to malls across America (the Mall of America rings a bell immediately) I know that you can combine luxury stores with activities without undermining the merchant's abilities to make loads of cash. Over the last few years, especially during the ripe economic depression, the mall has actively kicked out merchants who they felt were not up to a certain socio-economic class level, and have replaced them with stores that might more appropriately entertain their highest end customer. I suppose that's a bit harsh really, but it's their mall after all. The mall offers pleasant stroll opportunities, but since it's outdoor be sure you're dressed warmly enough if it's cold out. A cup of coffee from one of the several places (La Baguette or Starbucks) will keep you buzzin' around as you walk around the mall campus. (I might suggest you go pick up some espresso at Tootsie's at the Stanford Barn first as I've newly discovered it thanks to Bradley N.) The pretension is thicker than other large malls in the bay area, but you also don't have much of the riff-raff to deal with. It's a bit of a trade off I'm sure. Frankly, I try to avoid malls whenever I can, as they feel sterile and only serve to make you feel guilty that you're not an active enough consumer in this capitalistic society. It takes away from all the amazing experiences you could be having in the great big world. But hey, if you've got an itch to buy something I'm certain you'll find it here.", "business_id": "2oFme3IiUSSi0PdAJNBxwg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-26", "type": "review"}
