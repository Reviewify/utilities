The bulgogi burger is really flavorful and tender in between two soft and freshly made buns. You can top off your burger at the condiment bar and be sure to get some of the homemade sauce. The homemade sauce is goodness. I even dip my fries into the sauce instead of ketchup. And the fries? REALLY GREAT. They are crispy and flaky on the outside and one of the better burger joint fries I've had. Their regular burgers are also great if you aren't into bulgogi meat. So pop into this place and be prepared for the greatness of the bulgogi burger (or a regular burger) that is placed infront of you, you won't be disappointed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "dw3ukrM4VTRfgJEkCB-cIA"}
