Had lots of fun with Travis, Debbie Y., and Kevin C. !!! The drinks alone are 5 stars, but I'll give the food 4 stars. Their Chimichangas were pretty tasty and meaty. The margaritas are truly diabolical! I had one...ONLY ONE and I was wasted. Kevin C. had 3!! I think he was hurting the next day. Poor thing. The strawberry margaritas are pretty good too and less strong. I think I'm gonna stick with those the next time I go here. I may need a few more weeks to recuperate from last night.", "business_id": "LdfOPA0n7_KgeckwP3mEXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-18", "type": "review"}
