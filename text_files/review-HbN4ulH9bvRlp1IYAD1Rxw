It's nothing but you and the stage, baby, and the acts that come through to TT's are great, great, great. From indies electronica to Swedish glam rock, I've seen all kinds of awesome shows here and the energy has always been electric -- thanks in part to, yes, the \"intimate\" size of the stage. The bar also serves some mighty stiff drinks here, which I love. You can't go wrong with TT's. You can take the T right to Central or park at the Green Street garage just a street away. TT's forever!", "business_id": "t2xsi7qIN0iwGiOyCn7k8Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-11", "type": "review"}
