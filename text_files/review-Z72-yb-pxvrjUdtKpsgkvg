Let me count the ways: 1. Fruit, and lots of it.  Other buffets don't have fruit because they are too cheap to offer fruit and don't trust their customers not to steal it all and leave them penniless.  But you trust me, Rangzen, and for that I love you. 2. There's a nice sign that says \"Please respect the food.\" Translated from the Zen, that means, \"Dont be a pig, bozo.  Only take what you plan on eating.\"  That's a good reminder.  The food looks so tasty at Rangzen, you might be tempted to pile it on.  Which brings me to: 3. Many different sized plates for your dining convenience.  How wonderful!  If you're a big boy, you can take the big plate and pile it up.  If you only want a little, get a little plate.  For me, the medium oval-shaped plate is just right.  I like to fill it up twice! 4. I always feel awesome after I eat here, even when I don't hold back on the seconds and thirds.  I think that is because they offer lots of fresh vegetable dishes that are as equally appetizing as the meat and tofu and fried stuff dishes. 5. Variety, variety, variety, the spice of the buffet.  6. Two kinds of tea - one with milk and one without.  I hate fussing with putting milk in my tea, so a tea-with-milk dispenser is so nice. 7. Chicken with mushrooms.  So good.  How do they get it so good?  Wait, wait, I don't want to know.  Rangzen, you are a wonderful place. I guess I could go on.  Now that I've discovered the lunch buffet, I don't bother to come here for dinner.", "business_id": "HxegWRjhi7m73mXRI8qQIg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-03-24", "type": "review"}
