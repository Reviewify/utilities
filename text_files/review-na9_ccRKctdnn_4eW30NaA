I love the wall of beer taps they have, dozens and dozens of brews available on tap, and hundreds more in bottles or cans; 3) it's perty and shows well to out of towners. While they gawked at the VT game, sans sound since the World Series was also on and got priority (naturally), I perused the beer list as well as the food menu and settled on a Belgian white ale and an order of buffalo wings. The wings were just okay. The medium spice level was whimpy -- I need to go hot next time for sure. Random anecdote: Despite what I was recently told by an apparently misinformed Atlantan, my friends from Virginia assured me that VT's mascot the Hokie is NOT a neutered turkey.
