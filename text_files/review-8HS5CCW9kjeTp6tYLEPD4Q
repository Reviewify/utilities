Perhaps one of the best omelettes I've had in a while. Delicious apple bacon with quality creamy cheddar... delish! Very good strong coffee too. The biscuits were so good. toasted and flaky, paired with the creamed butter and fresh apricot spread... so good! my only complaint was that my brother's home fries were not entirely cooked through. However, they were nicely seasoned. The servings of everything compared to those in LA was a bit on the small side. The ambiance is very cute with old doors refinished as tables. It's all very bright, cute, and happy feeling! Clean bathrooms are also bonus!", "business_id": "ugekAf0_3hreoD5VJQjkCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-08-03", "type": "review"}
