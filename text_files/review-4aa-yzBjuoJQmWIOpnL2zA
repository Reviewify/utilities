They calmly kept trying to help her despite her totally insane confrontational attitude...over bagels. I don't want to think about what this woman is like in other aspects of her life. Anyway. I come to einsteins a least once a week, and they've never messed up an order of mine at this location. The bagels are always fresh tasting, the coffee bar is always maintained and clean. As far as bagel places go, it's got anything you could ask for. A little tip, if you keep your receipt and do the survey at bagel talk, youll get a free coffee the next time. It's great! I don't know how this place is for lunch, it's always a breakfast/reprieve from work place for me. I work right around the corner, so I always walk here. Might rate it 4 stars if i had to drive since the parking lot is small and difficult to turn around in. The staff has always been friendly and polite, but this morning was a pretty incredible show of customer service.", "business_id": "fTF5-p6NQ8X6WtJ_n81CRw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-18", "type": "review"}
