Making my ridiculous drunken forays into Champaign-Urbana much more comfortable and filling.\n\nI love this place, but it's just a diner.\n\nThe atmosphere and look of the place is classic 1950's diner, which is actually pretty awesome.  I seem to always get the really short and rude servers.  The ones that make you feel like you're not supposed to be there.\n\nSo, there you have it.  It's great food, poor service, great looking diner, great price.  But, man have my waitresses been bitches.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wsuzuLD3KV7L8oMinLCI0A"}
