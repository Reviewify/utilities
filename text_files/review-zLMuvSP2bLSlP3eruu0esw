The first thing I tried was the BBQ chicken pizza. It was really thin , but really filling for me as I don't eat that much pizza anyways , but I really liked it ,my friends and I usually share one . Nowadays I usually get the club sandwich and I love it. It's just the right portions and the bread is so good and the salad on the side makes me feel a little better about eating so much. haha great vibe though and it's usually not crowded enough where you have to wait forever long.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bELqNoqvhAcrOyL-i-iwpA"}
