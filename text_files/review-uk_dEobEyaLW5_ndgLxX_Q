The meat is densely packed and not terribly beefy; the downside of using pre-packed patties, I guess. Not as good as the loose, freshly ground beef at EJ, or the larger medium-well burgers at Mr Lu's. This is a halal shop, which is good news if you're Muslim, but bad news if you like bacon cheeseburgers. The eggplant and veggie burgers are also surprisingly good; the veggie burger reminded me of Indian-style 'bhej cutlets'.\n\nStill, when everything else is closed, this is a nice change from Aladdin's and Memo's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XQcSFSkoD7N_VcFGbMmobw"}
