They're ONLY hot dogs, right?  Maybe it's because they're open until 3am and I love stopping by after a Berkeley party.  Or maybe it's because they have a huge variety of hot dogs- from linguica, to chicken apple, to VEGAN?!  Amazing little hole in the wall.  Funny workers also.  The same guy is always there making his random sarcastic remarks, which is funny to watch while in line.  At times, the line can get long but they move pretty fast.  Great place to stop by on your way to/from Berkeley for some $3 hot dogs! 4 stars for Top Dog!", "business_id": "qHmamQPCAKkia9X0uryA8g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-19", "type": "review"}
