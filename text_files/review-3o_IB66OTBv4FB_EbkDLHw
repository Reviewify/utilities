What was it?  Why is it in a perpetual state of construction?  Is anything going to open there?\n\nWell, finally it's open.  Quality is a new bar run by two brothers from Watseka, IL.  In a strange coincidence I happened to be good friends with a brother of the two owners back in San Diego, and he told me that the place was opening, so I headed to their soft opening last night.\n\nIn short--this place has amazing potential.  It's got a great lay out, first off, two separate rooms, with large space and funky vibe--one room boasts everything from a vintage Ms. PacMan table/arcade game to a haphazard book collection to a chalk wall and bench overlooking Neil Street; the other room showcases the expansive bar, which is host to an AMAZING selection of great beers on tap.  You have beers like Founders available next to great California beers like Stone and Lagunitas; it makes me both homesick and delighted to see what they've got on tap.\n\nI'd really heartily recommend going; I think this place is going to be the next spot to watch in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CSn2-XpArLLYeZ_k2BKzrg"}
