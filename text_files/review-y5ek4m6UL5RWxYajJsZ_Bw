I just love getting off-campus for brunch, and indulging in food that tastes like it was made by someone's grandma.  When I visited campus last weekend, I went back for Sunday morning brunch, and enjoyed the Courier Breakfast - 2 eggs, 4 half-slices of toast, potatoes, and bacon.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp.  Problem with that?  No.  It's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but I got exactly what I wanted and I enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time.  I'd always come back here for brunch.", "business_id": "o13eH93qmWVNFZogkjhd9w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-25", "type": "review"}
