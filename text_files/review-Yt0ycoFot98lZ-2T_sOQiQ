(so cheap! i can get what i need for about $1.50 at 30 cents an ounce!) that said, the yogurt at yogurt harmony is better-- at least for the plain tart. i was just slightly disappointed by the plain tart at yogurtland. their cheesecake bites are amazing and i really like their strawberry frozen yogurt, but deep down, i am just a picky lover of plain tart frozen yogurt. i'm not hating (the 4 stars is proof) but if you want quality plain tart fro yo, go to yogurt harmony-- their frozen yogurt doesn't have one bit of that powdery taste that i unfortunately taste at most places, including yogurtland. personally, i'd come to yogurtland for all their amazing toppings, then trek over to yogurt harmony and order a plain tart. (haven't done that yet, but i am seriously considering doing that next time) but, of course, yogurtland is so close to campus! and so cheap! what's not to love!? (one more slight negative-- if you're a fresh fruit lover, only a few of their fruit toppings are \"fresh\". most of them are syrupy.. and yummy, but just fyi if you are picky about that)", "business_id": "Hhfga62zdR5TxuqtleNHCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-28", "type": "review"}
