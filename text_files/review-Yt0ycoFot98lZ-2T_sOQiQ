(So cheap! I can get what I need for about $1.50 at 30 cents an ounce!) That said, the yogurt at Yogurt Harmony is better-- at least for the plain tart. I was just slightly disappointed by the plain tart at Yogurtland. Their cheesecake bites are amazing and I really like their strawberry frozen yogurt, but deep down, I am just a picky lover of plain tart frozen yogurt. I'm not hating (the 4 stars is proof) but if you want quality plain tart fro yo, go to Yogurt Harmony-- their frozen yogurt doesn't have one bit of that powdery taste that I unfortunately taste at most places, including Yogurtland. Personally, I'd come to Yogurtland for all their amazing toppings, then trek over to Yogurt Harmony and order a plain tart. (Haven't done that yet, but I am seriously considering doing that next time) But, of course, Yogurtland is so close to campus! And so cheap! What's not to love!? (One more slight negative-- if you're a fresh fruit lover, only a few of their fruit toppings are \"fresh\". Most of them are syrupy.. and yummy, but just fyi if you are picky about that)", "business_id": "Hhfga62zdR5TxuqtleNHCg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-09-28", "type": "review"}
