So, we figured we should give it a shot while in town.\n\nAnd I am glad we did.\n\nYou should know, we asked this manager, John (I think), what were his favorite meals.  And he recommended the meatloaf, pork chop, and turkey pot pie.  All comfort foods.  So, there you go.  From the expert.\n\nWe did the meatloaf and the pot pie, and here is our low down.\n\nThe meatloaf was wonderfully seasoned with a beautiful combination of herbs and seasonings.  And even though I usually find meatloaf to be bland and mushy from too many bread crumbs in the mix, this one I would come back for.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent.  Mr. B was privately awarded a Clean Plate Club award for his well practiced scraping techniques used on that poor plate.\n\nThe pot pie was almost great.  I loved the flakey crust (I am so hard to please in that department) and the lightly herbed, cream filling.  The filling had lots of chunks of turkey breast, carrots and peas, and maybe some potato. My only regret was they had overcooked the turkey.  The flavor was delicious and I could hardly keep from licking that dish.  I hope they figure out how to fix their problem with the turkey.\n\nThe ambiance was cute, Victorian themed, busy with lots of flowers, glitz, and glam.  This is a magical place to bring your cute little old granny and the kids. And quite close to Cal Poly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Gx2873IIvAYb9eRvXKJoYg"}
