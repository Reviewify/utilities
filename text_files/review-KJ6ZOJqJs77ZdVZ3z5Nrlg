But it can be a fun scene every once in a while. The hotel portion is a little better. The rooms are pretty, like something out of metropolitan home magazine and spacious. Feels more like a residence than a hotel. And I asked for a masculine bouquet to be in the room, and it was right on, taupe vase with calla lilies. But later when I called to ask them to bring some toothpaste our phone wouldn't work and I was in no mood to wander down to get some. When I mentioned it in an email a little while later they were super apologetic and offered me some bonus points. So that was cool. A good staycation option.", "business_id": "9ta6U2F5ma2UauHBS-i1dg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-03-21", "type": "review"}
