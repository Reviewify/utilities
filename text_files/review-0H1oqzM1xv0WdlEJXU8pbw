Tara left me standing at the desk ignoring me, no hello, no nothing. Until finally I said eh hem...I would like to check in...I mean HELLO!!! I asked her politely where to go after I checked in and she said, \"I don't care, you can stand there or whatever\" This was the rudest welcome ever, and especially when you are teaching about peace and opening up your heart chakra. This made me literally almost turn around and leave! The teachers may be ok, but if you are turned off before you even get to try what is the point?!! ATTN BUSINESS OWNERS: You will quickly not make it in Pasadena with that kind of \"I don't need your business attitude\" Word spreads quickly in this community. My advise, Hire a sweet front desk girl and save your reputation before it burns like wildfire.", "business_id": "nzbY3o-0PBFaoNQDf_6c5A", "stars": 2, "date": "2012-02-25", "type": "review"}
