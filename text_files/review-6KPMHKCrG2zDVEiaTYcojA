It's not particularly unique either, but it's solid breakfast food. On the other hand, I'm honestly not sure why it's so popular. It's a go-to among Brown students and the East Side population. Hey, I mean I saw Emma Watson walking toward it as I was leaving Wickenden a few months ago.  Omelettes and oven-baked fruit pancakes it are stand outs. Omelettes I like how thin they make the egg layers its wonderful. Last time, I remember having the Norwegien (sour cream, chives, smoked salmon). Big Sky is also a favorite.  Food 3.5/5 Price to Quality 3/5 Price to Quantity 3/5 Ambience is very cute and homey. It's very welcoming for a brunch. Service is helpful and attentive.  Ambience 3.5/5 Service 3.5/5 Overall 3.5/5 - I'll round it up to a 4, but maybe it should be a 3 considering how long the lines are for weekend brunch.", "business_id": "oLwgMzsrvNsq-td3QrN3FQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-07-27", "type": "review"}
