This place has pictures of authentic Mexican restaurants on the wall. And that about sums up what this burrito joint is about. Authenticity aside, these burritos are pretty tasty. The guacamole and pico de gallo are fresh and delicious, and they are included in the price of most of the burritos. The fillings are also tasty -- especially the spicy chicken. Extra star for having a complimentary salsa bar. The green salsa verde and onion/cilantro mix are the perfect accompaniment to any burrito.", "business_id": "OIteGpWzFpQblKuwt7H80w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-13", "type": "review"}
