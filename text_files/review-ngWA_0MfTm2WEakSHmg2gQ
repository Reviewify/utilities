An order of 12 will set you back 7.95 plus a little extra for pan fry where they steam then lightly sear in wok. \n\nClean, small maybe 8 to 10 tables of happy people as its dumplings and good ones in a light thin wrapper with a mild ginger soy dipping sauce. \n\nThe shrimp were perfect and the pork mix rounded them out nicely.  \nOn top of this while my phone said 99 degrees outside their air was chilled for a great start to the weekend. \n\nYelpers thanks your reviews rarely lead me astray and this was no exception.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CWk6yFOoKJH5URub5XsHDg"}
