That's what I thought when I first met and talked with her, what I thought when she was working the kinks out of my body and giving me a deep tissue massage, and definitely what I thought when we talked afterwards about what is going on in my body.  She is friendly, has good energy, and is affordable.  All great things!  She also turned my husband into a convert of massages.  He had never had a massage in his life, but has been having a persistent pinched nerve issue.  After Bri helped to loosen up the kink in my left back, I convinced my husband to go see her.  He came back and said he loved the massage, that Bri really knows her stuff and that he'd come back again.  High praise indeed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QYt6UisYGh4RyUe05RY-ww"}
