I'm an 80's girl so I loved all the costumes...one of the muses was in drag....and the whole thing as hilarious, fun, and energetic...There truly is not a bad seat in the house.  Parking was free since it was winter break on campus....there was swing/breakdancing performed at the end of the show...and they had treats and a count-down by the cast...and a burlesuque show...FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!  Perfect for starting out a beautiful new year...", "type": "review", "business_id": "SYQfvQWYUeRTcEyS1PYOiA"}
