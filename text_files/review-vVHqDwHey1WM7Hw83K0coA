I wish I had a nicer Cartier so that it would have made the price of the service worth its while, since I only have the Must 21.  Then again my Must 21 is an \"every day\" whatever watch, so I must make do.  I will have a Tank Francais someday.\n\nOn the plus (and minus) side, I had to bring my watch back a few times because it stopped working after a week each time.  I believe the gears were old, and needed new parts.  They were quite professional, very good customer service.  It was worth it.  It has now been... a year... and the watch is working as good as new, tick tock, tick tock.\n\nAnd they even polished the front so the huge scratches I had accumulated over the past decade disappeared.  Nice work, Hamilton.\n\nOverall, they are decent and convenient for those in the Princeton area.  Now, if they only sold IWC's here instead of their Red Bank location, I would be salivating over the portuguese chrono, blue or black version!", "type": "review", "business_id": "chMf6XurNh_Xgs_Xv7kKww"}
