I don't know how excited about this place I am, though. The baristas know their stuff for sure. I had one experience where a barista was giving a customer crap and I wasn't sure what it was about, but it did make me uncomfortable.  I don't like the coffee as much as some places, it seems overly bitter (but keep in mind I don't know much about fancy coffee). They do have 2 vegan pastry options at the front which are really good. Small selection of tea. Some of the outlets are broken, which is bad for laptopers. Internet is slow as hell. Try to SSH into your home server - you will die. Upstairs it can get really hot! The bathrooms have graffiti, but it's like pretentious intellectual graffiti, which makes me laugh. I just feel kind of meh, it's an option.", "business_id": "U-R1wp_wCawilyq8b45vPg", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-11-08", "type": "review"}
