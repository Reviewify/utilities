Both the Food and Service are excellent. You WILL be properly looked after by an attentive wait staff. I would go with the 5 course menu with the Wine Pairings. Try the Escargot with Portabello Mushrooms. Each course is fully satisfying. Enjoy the views while dining. This is a nice place for the start of a Romantic Interlude!", "business_id": "5iuo1kvv0XZMS0bUOoLz2Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-20", "type": "review"}
