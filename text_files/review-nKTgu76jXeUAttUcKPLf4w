Ever since my terrible experience I've been reluctant to go to any hair salon. I strongly advise anyone who is thinking about getting their hair cut here not to, terrible service. No one wants to pay someone else to be mean to them, but if you do, go to nogginz in ann arbor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YwLdp-9G_iD7wc1MdUE1IQ"}
