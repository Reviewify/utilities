The laid back & chill atmosphere makes it feel like home. Everyone is a dog lover so my pup Bugsy has a blast every time he goes too! They have everything from delicious food to great drink specials. Not only that, but, the bartenders are all super rad as well as the rest of the staff. You can never go wrong going to Hole for the night if you have nothing else to do, unless you're an asshole who thinks to highly of themselves. Honestly though, in order to get a good feel of Austin Hole is the place to go. You get to experience live local music, shoot pool, pick songs from the jukebox, grab a couple rounds with friends & get first hand southern hospitality.", "business_id": "j2cYa0F0IU40EE4nh784yQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-10-08", "type": "review"}
