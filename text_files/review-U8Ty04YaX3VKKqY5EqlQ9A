The restaurant is beautiful inside -  1st star the bar had some great tiles - 2nd star it was open and bathroom was clean - 3rd star When I came in, the waitress  decided to finally approach me after I had almost walked all the way to the bar. She handed me a menu and told me that I can sit anywhere....haha... She brought out Chips and Salsa which were decent (but amount of SALSA) was very minimal. When I ate all of them, I asked the girl who brought them over for a REFill of chips and salsa. She told me that it would extra money. WHO Charges for more Chips and Salsa----THIS IS THE BASIS of Spanish restaurants..... So I ordered the pupusas ----took 16minutes for them to come out.... As I got them, they smelled aromatic but looked greasy. When I ate them , it confirmed that they were greasy.... Well, needless to say---other than the Karaoke Bar they may have set up---I will not be coming back to this place...... Please get nicer wait staff and Unlimited Chips and Salsa.....Guapo's once gave my friend and I ---at least 5 servings of chips and salsa.....", "business_id": "JndzI63laFLapKi9Tus5cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-01", "type": "review"}
