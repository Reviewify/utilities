She handed me a menu and told me that I can sit anywhere....haha...\n\nShe brought out Chips and Salsa which were decent (but amount of SALSA) was very minimal. When I ate all of them, I asked the girl who brought them over for a REFill of chips and salsa. She told me that it would extra money. WHO Charges for more Chips and Salsa----THIS IS THE BASIS of Spanish restaurants.....\n\nSo I ordered the pupusas ----took 16minutes for them to come out....\n\nAs I got them, they smelled aromatic but looked greasy. When I ate them , it confirmed that they were greasy.... Well, needless to say---other than the Karaoke Bar they may have set up---I will not be coming back to this place......\n\nPlease get nicer wait staff and Unlimited Chips and Salsa.....Guapo's once gave my friend and I ---at least 5 servings of chips and salsa.....", "type": "review", "business_id": "JndzI63laFLapKi9Tus5cg"}
