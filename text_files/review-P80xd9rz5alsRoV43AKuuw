I was very impressed by the decor.   I am a bar eater so this place fit pretty well.  The 5 items for $6 till 7pm is very good deal.  Top quality food for affordable prices.  The mushroom ravioli and cajun shrimp were very good.  Also, the bar burger is a great deal as well.   They don't offer the seared ahi tuna anymore.  That was the best item, but all of the other items offered are very good.   Overall, good food and good service.  I have been back a bunch of times and it is consistently good.
