I've definitely had better, but it wouldn't be fair to compare them with a sit down restaurant.  I would never compare McDonalds with let's say, Slater's 50/50 or even Islands, just because they both serve burgers.  So for what they are, they serve great Indian fast food.   I love the all you can eat lunch buffet.  The samosas are good.  The Veggie Korma is my favorite.  If I wasn't worried about smelling like garlic the next day I'd eat the Garlic Naan until I threw up.   As most have mentioned, the owners are friendly.", "business_id": "92727MDUGRemJ4hvN-hG1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-08", "type": "review"}
