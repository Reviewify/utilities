People come from all along the east coast to see this \"spectactular event\" and they pay loads of money for hotel rooms for this. Seeing it once for 15 mins is cool. I'll even admit that watching the fires being lite is pretty neat but that is as far as it goes. It has made the river even worse that it was before. The traffic in the city is horrible and all the families are pains in the butts.\n\nThis is not a must see event.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Ym45RegOmSidMgZsoMsL1Q"}
