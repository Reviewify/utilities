The style of cooking is from the Brittany region of France (in the North) and hardier, less complex, and less delicate than the stereotypical French cuisine.  The menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in CU but the food we ate was tasty, filling, and a nice change.  I recommend the salmon starter and specials.  Service was relaxed and friendly but not slow.  My parents both enjoyed the coffee.", "type": "review", "business_id": "epvLkQNL6MOvk3s6JlTntA"}
