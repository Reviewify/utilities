My general complaint is that the restaurants I've been to disguise the taco's flavor with things like lettuce, sour cream, and cheese (SAY WHAT?!?) Just when all hope was lost, I walked into Panchos, ordered the Pancho's Three tacos... and heard an angelic chorus sing. Meh, actually no. But Pancho's Mexican food is really as good as it gets (in the bay area). Their tortillas don't have that nasty packaged smell, and their ingredients taste REAL (notice the emphasis on REAL). Their beans don't seem to come out straight out of the can,and their tomato + guacamole are delectably fresh. Their quesadillas are big and fill you up. The customer service is OK; before 6 pm two ladies are working- they're Ok, but then, two guys serve their shift, and they are super funny and friendly :) The cashier dude in the afternoon has messed up my order a couple times, but I'll survive; the food and the cooks' friendliness balance those mix-ups. Ooooh! I recommend their hot sauce! Sooo tasty and spicy- it does give you a swift kick in the pants.", "business_id": "7x0i0seshwLXBVAam16wuw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-04-12", "type": "review"}
