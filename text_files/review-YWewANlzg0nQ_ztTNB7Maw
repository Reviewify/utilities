Did we say that yet?  We love this place!\nPadi is a tiny restaurant that serves the best fresh-made, home-style Indonesian fare in Seattle.\nTo say the owners and staff are friendly is an understatement. They treat you like family.\nThe food?  Give me their not-expensive Indonesian food over any high-end chi-chi place you can find. They win hands down.\nWe've been there twice in the past 2 weeks and we'll be back Saturday morning after our visit to the University District Farmer's Market, located directly across the street. \nGet your fresh fruits and veggies at the Market then stop in at Padi. We guarantee, after your meal, you'll walk out smiling.\nBring your friends, bring your loved ones; bring a stranger and they'll end up being your friend just to thank you for bringing them here.\nFive delicious happy stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kNKEjrUjM5BEEaQizH5Svw"}
