Padi is a tiny restaurant that serves the best fresh-made, home-style Indonesian fare in Seattle. To say the owners and staff are friendly is an understatement. They treat you like family. The food?  Give me their not-expensive Indonesian food over any high-end chi-chi place you can find. They win hands down. We've been there twice in the past 2 weeks and we'll be back Saturday morning after our visit to the University District Farmer's Market, located directly across the street.  Get your fresh fruits and veggies at the Market then stop in at Padi. We guarantee, after your meal, you'll walk out smiling. Bring your friends, bring your loved ones; bring a stranger and they'll end up being your friend just to thank you for bringing them here. Five delicious happy stars.", "business_id": "kNKEjrUjM5BEEaQizH5Svw", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-09-24", "type": "review"}
