Simple! The neighborhood here is happening! The two of us had: Mac & Cheese -- flavorful, crunchy on top, macaroni al dente--truly, one of the best ever; Scallops w/date and apple sauce, nicely seared, large and tasty; Chicken--great flavor, moist, and potato puree w/goat cheese -- decadent & yummy; Pork tenderloin -- will be finishing that dish today...big portion, a real deal for $25 and very delicious. High quality farm ingredients...a good red wine...home-made rolls, hot...chocolate mousse & pecan tart for dessert--also home-made and good! We left happy & satisfied. Service attentive & knowledgeable; very good music; comfortable room. If this restaurant was in my neighborhood I'd be there all the time. Very good value, excellent flavors...recommended without question.", "business_id": "EtHDmvirGVYBXX3kUmQQrQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-02-24", "type": "review"}
