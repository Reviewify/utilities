I wish I could give Tios 2.5 stars because that would be more appropriate, but 2 stars just seems a little too harsh.  To start with the good: our service was great. Also, my classic margarita was pretty damn good and pretty strong. Margaritas are half off during their 3-6pm happy hour which would make this strong, fresh tasting margarita a mere $4. Sweet! That being said, a happy hour priced margarita is probably the only reason I'll be coming back here. I do like the fact that you can mix-and-match a variety of taco styles to make a plate. However, I think that plate should automatically come with a side of beans and rice--instead, I had to order both a side of Spanish rice (meh. ok flavor, kinda mushy, giant pieces of bland stewed tomatoes) and a side of black beans (ICK. way too salty and very oily).  The tacos were all right. The soft shells were delicious and I love the simple presentation, but the steak fill was bland to the max. The chicken was better. Apparently, you get chips and salsa with the taco plate (I think?) so we had those as well. We chose the \"Hot\" salsa and it was a nice amount of heat--I really love spicy food, but I'd say I have an average tolerance for it. That being said, \"Mild\" would have to taste like spaghetti sauce or something. Besides the heat, the salsa was only ok. Not much flavor--tasted mostly like raw tomatoes. The chips were really good, though. All in all, Tios is expensive and not really worth it. \"Bland\" would be the word I'd use to sum up the whole experience. I'll be back for a half off drink, but I don't think I'll be visiting for dinner again.", "business_id": "t7zMY-nrQo09-UGtxOIugg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-10-24", "type": "review"}
