Here's my quick breakdown: GOOD (1) They have grrreat deals, seriously. (2) The place is huge and decorated in a nice contemporary style. Awesome huge windows make it extra airy. (3) You don't have to worry about \"breaking up\" with your stylist if your last visit didn't turn out because they probably graduated already and you'll never see them again. BAD (1) If there are details about your hair that needs to be explained (i.e., my hair doesn't bleach easily, etc.), you'll have to keep re-explaining it because you get a new stylist every time. Even then, it's unlikely they'll know what to do with this type of information because every single person I've had acted surprised when my hair was still dark brown after bleaching it for a half hour. (2) No matter what you need to have done, it will take at least twice as long here as anywhere else so be sure you have time to kill. (3) Be prepared to feel like someone's guinea pig. These people ARE students and will inevitably make strange faces when they don't know how to do something. Most of the time, an \"instructor\" will even come over and they will touch and talk about your hair as if you're not sitting right there. Final verdict? This place is the best if you're unemployed, adventurous, and broke. But take my advice and \"graduate\" to a real salon when you're done with school.", "business_id": "sT2fCWG0M6hXP09RQO4Tag", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-03-04", "type": "review"}
