They have a traditional menu, and a lot of specials during the week to attract customers. El Rodeo never gets too busy, so waiting for a table is never a problem, but the service can be a let down. They host $2 tequila shots on Tuesday night which tends to be a popular night for the college scene. If you don't want to sit down and eat, they also do take out.", "business_id": "qQouzhAOkppSq10tRI0nxA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}
