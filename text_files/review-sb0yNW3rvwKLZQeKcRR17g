Parking is available in the lot at the corner of Studemont and Main, or on the streets of the neighborhood.  Don't arrive late, because is really is a repurposed church, so when you open the door you're throwing light onto the movie screen and making everyone hate you.  (It's just one room).  They sell silly snacks, as well as Aurora schwag.\n\nProgramming notes: Expect home movie festivals, political documentaries, video dj performances, experimental pieces, great independent kids' shows, and other collected bits of image-driven bliss.  \n\nOther notes: Goes well with Onion Creek or Super Happy Fun Land.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QBEyyxwTOk52FTorMShvEw"}
