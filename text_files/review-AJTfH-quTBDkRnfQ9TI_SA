Great atmosphere, great students and staff !! They are extremely accommodating. Every client around me was extremely happy with the service they received and the ladies all had amazing hair when they left, I was very impressed to see all the results !! I had my hair, colored, highlighted, and cut-- all for only $30.00 !! Wow !!! I have received tons of compliments on my hair. The only down side about this place is it did take time. I was there for 4.5 hours, which is more than double the time it normally takes, but for the price I will be patient I will be back !!! This place is amazing !!!", "business_id": "pliofpu8St14SYgR17-9Dw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-01", "type": "review"}
