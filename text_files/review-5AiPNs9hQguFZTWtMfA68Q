This may be all that needs to be said, but I feel the need to elaborate: I hate beets. They are the most vile and revolting food on the face of the planet. If I could somehow kill all of the beets without disrupting various ecosystems and national cuisines, I would. I came here during restaurant week, and beet salad was the only feasible appetizer. I was pleasantly surprised that, not only did I not hate it, I loved it. The rest of the food was also good. There are some questionable large \"decorations\" hanging from the ceiling and other quirky decor. If there were more room in my budget for fine dinning, I would definitely come here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RThn3_Y6qN8MsqZKWa6WyQ"}
