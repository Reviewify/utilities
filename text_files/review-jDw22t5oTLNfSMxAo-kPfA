There was no wait and the food came rather quick. The menu for burgers is quite extensive and I cannot imagine coming here for anything else. The burgers are small (but thick) and stacked quite high.\n\nI got the Yuppie Burger and found it to be delicious though undercooked for ordering it \"Medium-Well\" (it has blood come out of it when I picked it up to eat it and that soaked through into the bun). The fries were only \"okay\" and I have definitely had better.\n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat odd inside. There are lots of tacky Elvis decorations and a weird, deformed blond bust statue of someone. It's a small restaurant and the tables are packed quite close together, which resulted in having to move to let people go to their table and getting attacked by the jacket of the woman sitting behind me when she took that off. Also be prepared to sit so close to people that you get to hear what they have to say.\n\nOverall I can't say I would recommend coming here, though the food was definitely worth eating. However, you can essentially get the same thing at UBurger (burger, fries, and a shake) and be just as happy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hzSyQBWeoX94WOpUtxuWVg"}
