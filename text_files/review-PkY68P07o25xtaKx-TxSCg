I hate going to this place because of the staff! theyre rude, they just installed the self-check out and if u want someone to ring up your stuff they ask you about a million times if you want to do it yourself. its obnoxious. i actually did pay by myself once and the computer froze as it was making my transaction and the guy didnt know what to do... we stood there for about 15 min trying to figure it out, he was beyond incompetent.\n\nthe selection on merchandise is quite nice. theres a lot and a wide selection of everything! its MUCH larger than the one on 34th.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nmbrMcMOZd-DQ-cM-x00tA"}
