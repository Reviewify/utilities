The main reason for this is very simple: Better ingredients and concept of service in most Europe and Asia...higher standards..if u will...u get my drift.. Newayz.. M happy to see this int'l chain finally in the US. The concept is very simple, clean and fresh...with enough choice of noodles from Soba to Udon. Food: very good and in decent portions. My friend and I tried the ebi kare lomen and the yasai chilli men (v) which were both quite good..accompanied some hot sake which definately kicked things up a notch in the bitter cold...:-))...Service was not good at all..my waitress was taking frequent trips to La La land..the only thing I liked about the service was that the server could swipe my card by means of a hand held device..which also noted our order by the way....The decor is very cool..casual..modern..open..oriental contemporary cafeteria feel..but I can understand some people not liking this because they arent used to it in the US...For desert the ginger cheescake was subtle and dense..and actually quite good...w some hot tea! I would go here again but with so many choices in great japanese, thai, malaysian food in Boston now...M less likely to go often!", "business_id": "hKQsbxqTWumRK8OPk3uoEQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-03-03", "type": "review"}
