I was waiting for a friend to go to lunch and I was supposed to meet him upstairs at Newbury Comics. I got there early and needed a place to go to pass the time till my friend showed. I decided to go to Starbucks. \n\nI love the decor. Very different from all the other Starbucks in town. I like all the wood in the space. I sat near the window and plugged in my new iPhone 4. I looked around and there seemed to be plenty of outlets for patrons. Also very helpful that there was free wifi. Free wifi is ACES! Standard Starbucks fare but served by friendly baristas. I have found my hangout spot in the Square.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GP5xVVJx0ekAky5BzyiQrw"}
