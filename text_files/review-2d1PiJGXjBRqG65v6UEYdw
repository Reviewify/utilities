I stumbled into Angkor on a windy Friday, looking for hot soup. I ordered the Nam Yaa and was quite disappointed. A very small portion for the price which was, at best, mediocre. I hope that my lunch was a fluke, but I am a little concerned since the Nam Yaa was heavily advertised both outside and within the restaurant. Maybe the quality of the food is just inconsistent, which would be a relatively easy fix for this new location.", "business_id": "wvzMYKKidWIWgPHFXeUW1g", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}
