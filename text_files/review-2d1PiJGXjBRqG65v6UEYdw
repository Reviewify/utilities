I ordered the Nam Yaa and was quite disappointed.  A very small portion for the price which was, at best, mediocre.  \n\nI hope that my lunch was a fluke, but I am a little concerned since the Nam Yaa was heavily advertised both outside and within the restaurant.  Maybe the quality of the food is just inconsistent, which would be a relatively easy fix for this new location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wvzMYKKidWIWgPHFXeUW1g"}
