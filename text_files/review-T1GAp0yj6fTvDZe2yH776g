This is a 5 star Greek restaurant. It's not the kind of place you go for a fancy evening out (Lafayette doesn't have many places like that to begin with) but if you're looking for great Greek food, a good selection of Greek beer and wine and a friendly, family owned restaurant then look no further. My favorites are the mbriame dinner, gyros dinner, vegetable plate, and of course the Saganaki (flaming cheese) Opa! Don't forget to visit the counter again after dinner for an order of baklava.", "business_id": "Lr8JBVx3SWvpBG7NcfdyoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-03", "type": "review"}
