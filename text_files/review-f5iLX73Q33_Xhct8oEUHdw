You see the potatoes being dunked into the vat of grease.  You see the dogs being turned and burned. I love the \"Help save the red baby baskets\" sign above the trash.  And most of all I love how they let me put whatever the hell I want on my hot dog without laughing in my face, then give me a bag of greasy waffle fries along with it.  Sitting in the booth with these things is a perfect college date -- no holds barred -- just you, the ketchup on your face, and the great intimate atmosphere.", "business_id": "hWIVlRQh25VuSQENGuHDhw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-14", "type": "review"}
