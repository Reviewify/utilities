Fill a standard 3-compartment styrofoam takeout container with food, weigh, pay, and go find somewhere to eat (like the picnic tables outside old union, or, if you have better self-control than I do, maybe you'll make it to the quad or the oval).  For what it is, it's surprisingly good quality, and despite the \"poorer\" crack, it's good value, at least for those of us in the \"real world\" now.  ;-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "EUhH6r8AJz5XFLE-ZBrALg"}
