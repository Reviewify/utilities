Decent selection of different varieties of Asian cuisine (mostly chicken and tofu dishes, almost all with veggies). Fill a standard 3-compartment styrofoam takeout container with food, weigh, pay, and go find somewhere to eat (like the picnic tables outside old union, or, if you have better self-control than I do, maybe you'll make it to the quad or the oval).
