Nobody knows of this place, but it's sooo good.\n\nI know because I worked there and I have a lot of friends that still work there. \n\nEverything is fresh and everything is made-to-order and everything is in huge quantities. Bento boxes here are huge that come with soup, salad, your entree, 4 piece of California roll and tempura. \n\nThe sushi rolls are extremely good. I suggest the Blue Moonlight. They have a huge selection and they won't cheap out on you with their fish. The chefs are nice and the servers are as well. \n\nHappy hour is 4-6 from Sunday - Thursday where selected items are massively discounted for the same portions.\n\nLunch Specials (11-4, everyday) are cheap and include bento boxes and dons(like personal size boxes rather than those huge bento boxes). \n\nThey even let you do to go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9VlV09HupfzZcRP3lTRi8Q"}
