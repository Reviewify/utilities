The outdoor patio with multiple mister fans is nice. Indoors it's just a sports bar though. Not much ambiance. Apparently they're known for their Mexican martinis which to me seemed like a too sweet margaritas served in a martini glass with olives. Not a fan. At least they're cheap. 1 Mexican martini is a full cocktail shaker = enough for 3 small martini glasses plus half glass refills for everyone for only $9.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fL_ilXgNUq_j9vMpZwdcLg"}
