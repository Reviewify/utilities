Yes, I know, I can't really review Octane when I don't go there for coffee (I hate coffee), but I do order a beer usually every time I'm in and experience the same service as any customer, so my points still matter. Octane is a cool place. While I'm not a fan of the coffee house vibe, it's a lot less stuck up than one would assume. Sure some of the patrons look a little beady eyed and geeky, poking from behind their laptops, but the employees are first rate, offering excellent service and staying on top of clean up and such. The whole place is always very clean and well organized, servers respond quick and aim to go above just giving you your beer (or coffee), they'll come out to the table with it if needed. Excellent selection of beers of course, which rotate out frequently, and a few good  single malts which is awesome for someone like me who drinks Scotch. While I'd like to see more room in the place, it's popular so it will always be crowded, which speaks volumes of it's attributes.", "business_id": "gQjjITQHLhpn6VN99q8BsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-02-24", "type": "review"}
