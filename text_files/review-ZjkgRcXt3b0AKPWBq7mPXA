The music venue is down a bit of stairs from the main bar and has a really intimate kind of feel to it because you're basically standing right in front of the band playing. A bit creepy for the band, but awesome for anyone standing close enough. They also place pitchers of water by the bar, so if you get a little thirsty while rocking out, just nip over to the bar and take a breather. The only problem I had with Blake's was that the sound system was all over the place. After every band finished, the new band would take at least 5-15 minutes to get the microphones working! It was a bit ridiculous after a while. but besides all that, it was pretty good. I'll definitely be going back.", "business_id": "4qTAwAN1vxszH-Lr4mnRKA", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-04-01", "type": "review"}
