A&C appears to be smaller, and thus, less well appointed than Pearl, but the store is actually stocked with useful things and the staff are friendly, helpful, and easy to find. I have had all good experiences with this store and will ALWAYS choose it over Pearl, even though its on the wrong side of the street from my T-stop.", "business_id": "e87ATHSkHmtvMDaiprLG0Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-01-13", "type": "review"}
