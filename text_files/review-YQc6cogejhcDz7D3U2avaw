My biggest issue is that the spiciness is really inconsistant. I love spicy foods, and some days I'll order \"hot\" and it's pretty bland. No spice whatsoever. Other days \"medium\" is too hot to eat. It's really a surprise what I'm going to end up with. Also, their padh thai tends to taste a bit ketchupy. Other times it's great. I don't know--the consistency problem again. I do want to give credit where credit is due: Their red curry and garlic peper chicken are both great. Also, the service is always quick and the staff is always friendly.  This is the perfect thai place if you're right off campus and have a craving, or are too tired to go across town. If you've got a car and the energy, just head down to Thairrific, or Noi's. It's always a bit of a gamble on how everything will taste.", "business_id": "NJneOd0ovmHiDS0dDLLHsA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-05-17", "type": "review"}
