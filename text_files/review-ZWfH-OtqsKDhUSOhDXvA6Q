It's a beautiful area to sit and eat oudoors at the picnic tables, right over the ocean.  The breakfast burritos are terrific and at $4.50, probably the best deal around.  The coffee is real coffee,  and a good variety of dark, medium and light roasts to choose from.  I was there for lunch and had the Reuben with Fries, and it was very good, lean corned beef grilled on rye.  Perfect!  They really have a great diverse menu including daily blue plate specials.  Really glad I found this place!!!  Don't really understand the first review, as I thought the service was fast, friendly and well done.", "business_id": "V_la4sa6CKvEUO4ZGo939w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-18", "type": "review"}
