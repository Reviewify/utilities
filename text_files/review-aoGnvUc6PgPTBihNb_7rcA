Unique, quality pieces. The bad: rude, rude, RUDE staff. I walked in expecting to spend about $350 on plants for my patio and after practically begging to speak to someone, she told me to \"look in the back, there's a sign, it's not that hard.\" Seriously? I know I am young, but I'm willing to drop some cash on your business and you send me off on my own so you can keep chatting with your co-worker? After looking around on my own I tried to find someone else to take pots and plants to my car and every single person told me they were busy and kept walking. Lost the sale, lost the customer, gained a negative review. I can't buy something if they won't pay any attention to me.", "business_id": "6iKG4yXZdIz0WY4scYtSQQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-06", "type": "review"}
