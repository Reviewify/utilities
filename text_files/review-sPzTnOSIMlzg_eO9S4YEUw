BECAUSE the vanilla bean creme brulee is served with the v. same fruit (papaya!, pear, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries) and sauce (apricot, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry, cream) that would appear, unaccompanied, on your fruit plate!  Unlike my creme brulee at Fonda, this sugar cracked delicately w/ the tap of spoon.  \n\nThe bottom line:  A business dinner turned pleasure.\n\nERF", "type": "review", "business_id": "-79JF6MafhGg1B_KRDl8vA"}
