Now that's cleared up, this cafe is everything a collegiate cafe should be. The coffee isn't particularly good, never seems to host ample seating and tons of students mooching off the free wifi. Yep, collegiate cafe. I have to say that I do fall into ambiance of Caffe Strada. It's nested in southeast corner of UCB campus on the corner of Bancroft and College next door to Bancroft hotel and across from Adagia. I like sitting outside on sunny weekend afternoons underneath the shade and in the mornings I particularly enjoy sitting inside in the wooden bench and tables (if I can find a spot). The inside tables are great for getting work done as they provide a large area of workspace and great lighting. Coffee: Caffe Strada pulls their shots really long. One shot of espresso should be pulled roughly from 10-12 seconds making a double should take 20 seconds. If a shot is pulled any longer, the espresso starts to become bitter. This happens a lot to me at Strada. Their espresso is kind of runny. Their lattes are mediocre. Tamping the ground into the portafilter should be done by exerting at least 35 pounds of force onto the ground, but I've seen my espresso made with very minimal or no tamping at all. I usually get tea here. Almond croissants are delicious here in the mornings before the croissants become stale. Don't get them at the end of the day as they are usually gone by then or they'll have become hard. GREAT study environment, again!", "business_id": "_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-01-07", "type": "review"}
