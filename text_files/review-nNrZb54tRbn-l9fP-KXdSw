It's something \"different\" from the other museums and memorials in the Museum District. Quite somber, but still very educational. So it's $5 per person, although it's presented as a \"suggested donation,\" but don't be a cheap jerk, all right? I was perhaps a tad hormonal or something during my last visit because I nearly burst out in tears more than a few times. Hey shut up. The pieces of memorabilia, video segments, photos are very adequately adorned with explanation blurbs and nicely edited to convey the overall the serious but educational tone of the museum. It's a fairly quiet place, obviously so probably not the awesomest place to introduce to fussy kids. I think one of the more notable aspects of the museum is that it incorporates narratives from survivors that ended up settling in the Houston area. Something about that seemingly makes the experience all the more intimate. There was a temporary (I think?) painting exhibit on the day I visited that was rather moving and sobering. A great deal if childish imagery juxtapose with jaggedly rusty Holocaust shapes and whatnot. There were also a couple of tribute areas separated from the main exhibit that warrant a visit. Definitely recommend if you haven't been and even if you have! I enjoyed my previous visit years ago but something about this more recent one just really kind of stirred me up unexpectedly. Yeah yeah, insert something introspective.", "business_id": "lXXRM94hPvo0zS7UpE1mlg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-31", "type": "review"}
