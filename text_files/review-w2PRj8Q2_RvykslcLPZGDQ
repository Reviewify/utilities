They do the basics extremely well, and they also nail the more creative dishes. The service is excellent. Come here on a Sunday night. The standard nigiri are just $1 each, plus they fly in lots of exotic fish from all over the world.  There's nothing like a salmon roe maki at Cafe Sushi on a Sunday night to lift my spirits and prepare me for a new week.", "business_id": "SSmHkP0tZ4TKn_YUOEkVUg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-09-14", "type": "review"}
