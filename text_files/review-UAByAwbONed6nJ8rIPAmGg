I've been here twice and the second trip was less fun than the first.\nthe food:\ntypical pasta buffet ...macaroni and  cheese, Alfredo,  marinara.. \nNot to shabby. \nSalad bar...it's okay has enough selections to create  a satisfying salad (hard boiled egg was my favorite) \nPizza :\nA lot of options to pick from it's best to pick out the ones freshly out.  \nDesserts :\nWack!!  There's only 2  sundae options vanilla or chocolate with sprinkles.\nThe other options are doughnuts, which look dry and old, cheesecake that looks yellow, chocolate cakes that are big and have too much frosting .. and a decent cinnamon roll. \n\nGames: \nEverything you play is operated by a credit card that has token value. So instead of carrying a pocket full of coins you get a card. Awesomeness. And if you lose it you can replace it for $0.25. There are still a few coin-op games and also token machines.  The games are the usual skills games, not.as fancy as chuck e. Cheeses in that sense. Also, whatever tickets you get go onto the card :). For the games that still shoot out tickets you can go.to.a.machine out front and put the ticket value in to your card. Easy. If you have an issue doing so, the workers are always really nice. \n\nRestrooms :\nPlentiful and clean", "type": "review", "business_id": "bqwQawpoIqNmITtZHHMXhQ"}
