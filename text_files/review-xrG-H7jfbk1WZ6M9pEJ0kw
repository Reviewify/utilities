Boyfriend and I ordered the crunchy roll, Alaska roll, and baked lobster roll. Total was $30 + $2 tip for delivery, although they offer free delivery. His favorite roll? The baked lobster roll, which was covered in a creamy (mayo!) sauce. My favorite roll? The Alaska roll, which was topped with thin (booo!) slices of salmon and avocado. Overall, the rolls were satisfying. The crunchy roll was not too memorable... but I would order the baked lobster roll again. In all honesty, I think the sushi rolls at The Bistro on UCSD campus are a better bang for your buck. But if you have late night sushi cravings, Del Sushi isn't a bad choice at all.", "business_id": "LDfM6KhpTXP53TegRa_UAg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-06-01", "type": "review"}
