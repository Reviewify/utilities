Started off with the Mac and Cheese skillet. Good, but not great. It was drizzled with sour cream and had a pretty mild flavor overall by no means bad, just not outstanding. We then shared the Cowboy Burger, this was delicious. Loved the tangy beer BBQ sauce and fried onion straws, was cooked medium as requested. Overall, very tasty burger. Great friendly service from Felicia. We will be back for sure. Fianc\u00e9 can't wait to try the homemade chocolate chip bread pudding.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TFxcmjVIsW5bdW7rilHHpQ"}
