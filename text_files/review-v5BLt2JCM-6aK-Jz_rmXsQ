The coffee was okay, the almond croissant tasty (although, I have to say, disturbingly not crescent-shaped. What are things coming to when any old flaky pastry can call itself a croissant, eh? But I digress...). It seemed from what I saw that the sandwiches come with a mini-scoop of bean salad. Can't say anything bad about bean salad. But I was really just underwhelmed. The cafe leads into Harvest, so there's kind of a \"thru-traffic\" feel. The decor isn't bad, but it lacks character. Kind of sterile, soulless. As a grad student with no office and a flexible schedule in the summer, I'm trying to check out all the indy cafes within a bikeable radius, but this has been the least interesting one I've been in yet. There weren't many patrons, and often there were long lags in the music playlist. And the comfy seats were arranged in a kind of face-off position, so you're either right next to or staring down some stranger - or both. Unless you manage to find a particularly cute stranger to stare down, it doesn't seem like much fun. I applaud the place for its commitment to advertising other small businesses in the area, and for its mission to be a responsible, organic, fair-trade establishment. Also, they take credit cards, which is a help for those of us who never remember to get to the ATM. But, while I like all those things, those alone aren't enough to get me to patronize an otherwise unremarkable cafe, not while there are others to be found nearby.", "business_id": "RTtjmOACubX5UwQeXEss1A", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-11", "type": "review"}
