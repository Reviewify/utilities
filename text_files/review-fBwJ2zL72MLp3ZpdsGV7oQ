When I say that, I mean I had just eaten lunch about 45 minutes before. I was taking a friend to the airport and he wanted to make a stop there. \"Okay, but I just ate and I'm full, so I'm not going to get anything.\" Ya, right. This was the first time I had visited since the grand opening, which means his full menu was out, and as soon as my eyes saw the \"chicken and waffle\" option, I basically had to order it, hungry or not. This is the sandwich I had been waiting for. If you know me, you know that I am a huge, huge, passionate, lover of fried chicken and waffles, and although the chicken in this sandwich was rotisserie chicken and it's actually french toast instead of waffles, it was freakin delicious! Plus: for all you Friends fans out there, this sandwich has a moist maker in it!!! The sauce is a cayenne infused maple and I was a little worried that it might be too sweet for me (I have a general aversion to most things sweet and gravitate towards spicy foods) but just when I thought it was getting too sweet, I got a punch of that cayenne. The flavors evened out perfectly and about 10 minutes later, I was left with some crumpled up foil in my slightly sticky hand.... and here I thought I was full. I guess Nic just knows my stomach better than I do! In case my review and update didn't convince you, I will quote my friend who got the Bacon sandwich: \"I just had an orgasm in my mouth.\" And he's a guy who knows what he's talking about.", "business_id": "OIhLVqFOibyXnZCTlCt43A", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-05-04", "type": "review"}
