We went there for dinner on our vacation up north. The staff, food, and ambience was stellar. It was a cold night and the waitress brought over a heat lamp and a blanket for me. Great place for a date night. \n\nI do recommend making a reservation to ensure you don't wait for a table. You'll score a better table this way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C44mTlN9hDsy9CGlgRQ8sw"}
