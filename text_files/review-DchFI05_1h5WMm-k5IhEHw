Starting off with the fresh house salad with the creamy Gorgonzola bleu cheese dressing...the second best salad I've ever had, then the soft, garlicy bread balls topped off with their tomato sauce.\n\nWe'll have one of their wine flights, three glasses of wine...a white, a rose, and a red...where all three equal about one regular glass for $7.95.  It's nice to have a selection of wine tastes to choose from throughout your meal.\n\nThe food here is definitely not light.  Yeah, it is on the creamy side so know that going in, it is still very good.  The prosciutto alla fettuccine in a creamy pesto sauce is all bacony, creamy goodness.  The lasagna al forno is a hearty, cheesy, meaty delight. My go-to dish here, however, is the tortellini della mamma, a tricolor dish of little pasta pillows filled with cheese and covered with their garlic cream sauce with bits of fried prosciutto sprinkled about.\n\nFull dinner prices run about $15 - $30 including your salad or soup.  A smaller bites menu has good sized entr\u00e9es without  salad or soup running around $9 - $15.\n\nService is excellent and professional.  It can get a bit crowded on a Saturday night, so a reservation would not be a bad idea but you can usually get by without one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WW1OGeUifaMsDIwphitvUg"}
