The actual building it is housed in (rumor has it) was a mortuary.\n\n I think it opened in '74, I got a job as a dishwasher there in '76. \n\nThe guy who owned it became a coffee buyer for Starbuck's.  Or maybe THE coffee buyer for Starbucks. He was pretty instrumental in the coffee revolution. \n\nIt was always a place where you could go and get fresh squeezed OJ, scones, or tea in a beat-up aluminum pot. There was always an amazing assortment of posters and notices on the bulletin boards. There was usually some decent art on the walls that changed out pretty often. People would read Proust or Wittgenstein. The only music was classical. The side room opened a little later and the upstairs after that. It used to have 2 bathrooms. It's been through many iterations. Customers would spill out in the alley and sit on the curb. There was an open space across from the large windows that let in lots of light.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who can tell a high acid coffee from a mellower blend, you really have the former owner of this cafe to thank for that. He really made it possible for all of us to be coffee aficionados.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G_xjBimSuQ73gEg1wYDacA"}
