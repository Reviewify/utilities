Coffee and pastries are first rate. I decided to try the egg salad sandwich after reading all the rave reviews about it on Yelp. Mine was nothing like the photos. The yolks were cooked through and not creamy as described. Bread was good, but the egg salad was nothing to write home about. $7.50 is a lot for just an OK egg salad sandwich. I may give it another try because I love egg salad. King Julian rules!", "business_id": "UsrKX2305OkmeI7K7cizjA", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-02-02", "type": "review"}
