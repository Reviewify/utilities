The food was good, but not unique, and therefore won't leave me wanting to go back.  The prices were reasonable.  Spice Thai is a great place to know if you're in the neighborhood and want Thai food, but it's not a place that stands out - definitely not something to seek out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "84-VYasaVm6zCDw3T_LfDg"}
