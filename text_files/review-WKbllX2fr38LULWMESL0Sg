Seriously, my PVD friends love this place, but I found the vibe to be a bit weird. It was a rather open empty space, which may be good for super busy nights, but it just felt strange. The picnic tables are not my idea of comfortable seating and the music was unbearably loud. I'm glad we decided to head elsewhere for the night... I'll have to give it another shot and go with my Prov friends that really like the place.", "business_id": "Nye78ZSNcgyW3nqyTIeDMw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-05-27", "type": "review"}
