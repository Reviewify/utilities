The restaurant interior's got style and the Empanada branding is in your face. Sadly for my stomach, I fell prey to the slick stainless steel interior and happy colored text, and decided to make Empanada my dinner joint. Empanada serves mass-produced empanadas, and they're all terrible (I tried 3 different flavors). The crust tastes unfresh, the filling is sparsely sprinkled in and the whole experience is not only unsatisfying but also unfilling. The only plus side was that the staff were really friendly. Whoever started this chain needs to toss the marketing textbooks and find some cookbooks.", "business_id": "D3Sw_VHsaQGYdQjsZDv-Nw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-11", "type": "review"}
