The Palm Theatre offers show times in the early to late evening and plays off the beaten path movies. The viewing rooms are smaller and allows for a more enjoyable viewing experience, I think. Before you head into see your picture stop by the snack bar and grab some treats. Its a great experience and I am sure that you and your special someone will enjoy a night out in SLO with a flick at the Palm Theatre.", "business_id": "X9Hna0jBuwkFi-PoTl1w6A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-04", "type": "review"}
