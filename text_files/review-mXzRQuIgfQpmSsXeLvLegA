Just glad I wasn't paying! Looking at ~$100 per person. As with all steaks, I must compare to Peter Luger's in NYC. My T-bone hit the spot, but it was no Luger porterhouse. The wine from Justin Vineyards was a big hit at our table. Will definitely return for a special occasion or when someone else is paying.", "business_id": "d_IBp5wNVn5wDlNkblAL8w", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-04", "type": "review"}
