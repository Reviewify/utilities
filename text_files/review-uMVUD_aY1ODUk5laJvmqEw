You have got to try Kokepan if you haven't ! Definitely the best bubbletea place in Austin, however I frequent Tapioca House more because of convenience (the location is near my bus stop) and price :p.  I also used to go to Coco's on 183.  My rank for quality from best : Momoko, Coco's, and Tapioca House.    Price rank from cheapest is  Tapioca House, Coco's, then Momoko..    Because Coco's is stuck in the middle.. whenever I feel like having good bubble tea I'll go to Momoko, and for my frequent boba fix, I'd go to Tapioca House :)", "business_id": "iNVDkapV60vH3KIS7kYDDA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-06-05", "type": "review"}
