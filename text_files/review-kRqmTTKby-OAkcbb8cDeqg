I decided I wanted to go back to my natural strawberry-blonde color and thought the task would be impossible. I chose Aveda having used their products before and knowing that they were very gentle and hopefully wouldn't damage my hair any more than it already was. Not knowing any stylists, I took the next available appointment and found Robert. HE IS A MIRACLE WORKER! Instead of trying to rush the process and just throw bleach on my hair, he labored over 5 marathon-length appointments to slowly integrate light back in to my hair and the end result was spot on what I wanted. He is a true professional and knows color theory perfectly. Every appointment was an enjoyable time and now my boyfriend goes to him as well and loves his work. Overall, the prices are reasonable for a professional salon. If you have high maintenance hair, it is well worth knowing it is in good hands!", "business_id": "aEaxIo_duFCbbojwhkywAA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-17", "type": "review"}
