I've had great experiences dining there, and their outdoor area has a lovely view of downtown Franklin Street. Their food is good during normal hours. When I've gone with my family, we all been very satisfied. They brew their own beer, and I think they do a pretty good job of it.\n\nLater in the evening, when Top of the Hill becomes a bar, there have been a few missteps. A friend's nachos ordered from the late night menu were cold. My boyfriend asked the bartender if they had a certain brand of cheaper bottled beer (since he was trying to save some money), and her rudely-toned response was: \"We're a brewery, honey.\" She could have just said, \"I'm sorry, we don't.\" There are plenty of classy establishments that have serve cheaper beer options too, so I don't know what she was so indignant about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "56USR7ZY3Gsm4lR42yMQSg"}
