The CHEAPEST apartment I've lived in the area (by about $100) has been owned by Lavery Lohnes Properties. These guys are good at what they do and damn nice about it. It's been about a month since I moved out (nothing to do with them or the area) and I miss them.. A LOT.\n\nThe apartment was in very good shape, things that needed maintenance (laundry machines, etc) never went over a week without repair.. and everyone that I've chatted with at Laverty has been great. In fact, when they were painting or doing work they made sure to get in contact with my 2 other roommates and our house phone (not that it's a person...) before stepping foot into our apartment. And I know this is probably a law or something, but I didn't experience that with my other apartments in Boston. On top of the fact that they maintained the front areas well. They made sure the landscaping and walkway were always under control and groomed. \n\nIf you ever see an apartment being rented out by Laverty.. JUMP ON THAT SHIZ!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DwUXPw43ckdRVAdSE1Jcfw"}
