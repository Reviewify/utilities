I feel like people who do just complain too much and are afraid to tell managers when things aren't so good.  In this case....\n\nI couldn't find a manager and it was clear no one was in charge.\n\nWe waited 10 minutes for drinks.  Then tried to eat.  \nEverything was really bad.  Cold, undone, unfinished, unseasoned....\n\nI obviously had just paid to sit and have a glass of juice in a pretty room.  \n\nWhy can't such a cool hotel make them get their act together.  How can this be the official restaurant of the fox theatre?  Do they not eat over there????", "type": "review", "business_id": "iqK1C-4jHII1OFmLBQSbDg"}
