I feel like people who do just complain too much and are afraid to tell managers when things aren't so good. In this case.... I couldn't find a manager and it was clear no one was in charge. We waited 10 minutes for drinks. Then tried to eat. Everything was really bad. Cold, undone, unfinished, unseasoned.... I obviously had just paid to sit and have a glass of juice in a pretty room. Why can't such a cool hotel make them get their act together. How can this be the official restaurant of the fox theatre? Do they not eat over there????", "business_id": "iqK1C-4jHII1OFmLBQSbDg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-07-09", "type": "review"}
