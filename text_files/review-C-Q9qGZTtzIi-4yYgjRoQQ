It's open late and has pretty consistent tasting food. Ive tried most of their burritos and I have also tried their chicken enchiladas and crunchy tacos. All are pretty good and reasonably priced. The only thing I have tried that I know I do not like it the horchata. It was sub par to say the least, a disappointment for any mexican place. Today there was a lunch special, $6.75 for a burrito, it was pretty darn big. It came with rice and beans and choice of meat. Guacamole and sour cream as well. The beans were ok, the rice seemed re-heated, all in all it was a good deal and a quick choice. I know I'll come back.", "business_id": "LdfOPA0n7_KgeckwP3mEXA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-21", "type": "review"}
