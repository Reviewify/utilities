When you first walk in, there is a long gas fireplace with a small, but nice seating area to have a drink or wait for the table. The place has minimalist and modern decor with concrete floors, high ceilings, natural wood and stone. There is a lot of space between the tables and the bar stools, so you don't feel packed in. The have a decent beer selection, but mostly for the bottled beers. The draught beer selection is a little lackluster. I had the Mayflower Oatmeal Stout for $6 which is OK for this type of place. My friend is selective about her martinis and she enjoyed them. The meals are a bit on the pricey side ($15-29) and smaller portions. It's more about the taste and preparation. I got the burger ($15), my friend got the skate and we both got arugula salads ($9). The salads were decent, but not spectacular. My friend really liked the skate that came with lentils. The burger was cooked as I requested and enjoyable. It came with shoestring fries. I don't eat fries that often, so they need to be special. These were not. The service was great and as the crowd thinned out, the bartender spent some time chatting with us and remembered my friend from a previous visit. A big bonus is free parking. They validate if you park in the Technology Square lot.", "business_id": "2WXwWfhpfia7_UflDYnUyQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-05", "type": "review"}
