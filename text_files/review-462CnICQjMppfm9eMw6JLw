Not just Ethiopian, either, but GOOD Ethiopian. The injera here was PERFECT, spongy, tangy, and of the exact right consistency to soak up all the flavourful food-juice and still not fall apart. They also did not charge for more of it, which was very nice.  I ordered a combo plate, and both the meat dishes were perfectly spiced, especially the key wot. Too many places try to make this less spicy and end up with bland - this was full-strength and AMAZING, the good slow, persistent burn I was looking for. The ye'dinich salata was also a standout - I don't normally care for pickled beets, but this was so delicious I devoured mine and was making longing noises at my friend's portion.  Abysssina compared very well to Ethiopian I have had elsewhere, and I look forward to seeing them stick around for a long while. A note - BYOB, and you should. Beer + Ethiopian is a good call.", "business_id": "0A3irNk0Kb3vQasADoQCHw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-07", "type": "review"}
