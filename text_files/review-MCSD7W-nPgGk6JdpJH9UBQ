I was right.  This place was empty when we went (right at lunchtime in Pasadena and it was empty; can you believe that?!).  The reviewers are right in that the prices are a bit on the hefty side.  They do not have an \"all-you-can-eat\" option so don't even ask (because I asked and they said no).  You do, however, get unlimited rice.  The vegetables that came with my beef platter was missing tofu.  Fortunately, no one else in my group cared for tofu so they gave me theirs.  The decor is nice and the service was good.  The food just doesn't quite sit right with me.  The sesame dip was a little watery for my taste.  I'll come here again only if it's for Happy Hour.  Apparently ALL drinks are 40% off during Happy Hour!  Woo hoo!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MN6XdUPlkKjhIY87fdBjPw"}
