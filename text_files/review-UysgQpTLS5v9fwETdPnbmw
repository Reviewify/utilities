The perfect place for a date or a celebratory dinner. The food is top notch, the wine list is one of the best in the country and the service is impeccable.  It's not cheap but it's worth it. From Foi gras to duck to a dry aged steak it's all fantastic. The wine is pretty pricey but here's the thing: it's only marked up by around 50% while most restaurants try and get you for 2x or 3x the shop price. Had a fantastic bottle of Patricia Green Pinot that set me back around $60 that goes for around $40 in a store.", "business_id": "MJMTsZ0ty0RCyUjF_6XVPg", "stars": 5, "date": "2007-03-02", "type": "review"}
