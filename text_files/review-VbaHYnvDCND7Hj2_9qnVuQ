This place always inspires me to write a letter to someone dear to me, and quite frankly I think people have forgotten the beauty of intimate hand written letters. Envelopes in all shapes and sizes. Wrapping paper that'll make anyone say \"WOW\" Letter seals + wax Nifty greeting cards One of a kind notecards and thank you cards Folders and binders (today I discovered the stainless steal portfolios) Journals and diaries Cute novelty books and how could I forget...PENS Seriously, I can spend hours and hours in this store and enjoy every minute of it. I've been here plenty of times and I treat it like a museum when I don't have money to spare. But, it makes you want to load up on stationery and write someone a letter. Oh, and I love any establishment that sells quotable cards.", "business_id": "fa07LEZDLZQkXZ2qKNKLOw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-09", "type": "review"}
