Unfortunately, I can only give 2 stars because I have graduated to Specialty's cookies and Loard's ice cream....so it was just like something missing for my taste.  I only could eat half because it was just not that good. My friend also had to give up after half and declared she needed a different dessert.  The chocolate chip cookie was ok. The snicker doodle I got tasted raw and was overly soft. The mint chip ice cream was just not creamy and milky enough for me. I just didn't like what I was eating and had to stop.  One star for being cheap. And another star for having friendly service.  Maybe we went on a off day? It looked good but I was scared of eating that half cooked cookie. Maybe I only like the super fatty ice cream like Loard's and Mitchells? However, I do like that they have gluten free products! I will be back to try those out someday.", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-17", "type": "review"}
