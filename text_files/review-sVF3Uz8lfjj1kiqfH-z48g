Unfortunately, I can only give 2 stars because I have graduated to Specialty's cookies and Loard's ice cream....so it was just like something missing for my taste. \nI only could eat half because it was just not that good. My friend also had to give up after half and declared she needed a different dessert. \n\nThe chocolate chip cookie was ok. The snicker doodle I got tasted raw and was overly soft. The mint chip ice cream was just not creamy and milky enough for me. I just didn't like what I was eating and had to stop. \n\nOne star for being cheap. And another star for having friendly service. \n\nMaybe we went on a off day? It looked good but I was scared of eating that half cooked cookie. Maybe I only like the super fatty ice cream like Loard's and Mitchells?\n\nHowever, I do like that they have gluten free products! I will be back to try those out someday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r7Ggh7ejuBWjT0TQPW-ypA"}
