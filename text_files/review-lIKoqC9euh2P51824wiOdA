How are there not hundreds of these places?!? Cookie ice cream sandwiches are some of the best desserts ever.  At Diddy Riese you pick the homemade cookies you want on each side and pick the ice cream you put in the middle.   Did I mention it's only $1.50 for a huge dessert?  That's why there is a line down the street at all hours.  It moves quickly though - don't let it deter you.  Wait for any amount of time to experience DR. I'm going to go ahead and say this place is BRILLIANT!!!", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-10-19", "type": "review"}
