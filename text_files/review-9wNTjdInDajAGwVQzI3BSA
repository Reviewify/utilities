I like the Wushu dog a lot - it's filling and tasty. The toppings make it worth the price, which is only around $4 if you're a Dojo Dog VIP (all you have to do is like them on Facebook).  I had a Shaolin Monk dog once (don't remember the kind) and I definitely would not recommend it. It was super salty, unfilling, and expensive for having no bread and just seaweed.  Last but not least, get the mango jasmine tea! For $1.15 it's super cheap (don't know how long that price will last) and it's yummy, a solid mango tea with a hint of jasmine (might be too sweet, depending on the day).  I wish service were faster - again, the people are friendly but during opening week they were so slow both with dealing money and getting the food out quickly. They've gotten better but it feels like they cook one dog at a time - not very efficient.", "business_id": "ya60yzziKMfgyFLAdUNdFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-10", "type": "review"}
