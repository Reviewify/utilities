My wife and I each ate a falafel sandwich with tabbouleh on the side. It tasted very good when I ate it, but it turned out to be one of those enjoy-now-regret-later things. I've gone back a few timessince to eat, get coffee, and study, and I think the two star \"meh\" rating sums it up. The sandwiches are pricey, which is understandable considering the location, but they're not particularly good. The coffee is fine, nothing to write home about. People looking for genuinely tart frozen yogurt will do better to go to the bubble tea place at the end of South University. Amer's bascally limps by because it has okay food and drink, not very outrageous prices, and a great location. The seating and atmosphere are okay for an hour or so but not cozy or even particularly comfortable. When I want to stay at a place for long, I'll choose either Espresso Royale next door or Starbucks because they have no internet.", "business_id": "cRNCEb37UK7KJeG9kMgPzQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-08-19", "type": "review"}
