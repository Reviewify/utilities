I could list the downsides (seasonal, pricey, weird guy at the entrance investigating IDs) but other than that little aside, I won't.\n\nThere is just no better place to enjoy a warm afternoon in Ann Arbor with friends than Dominick's, given the following three rules: First, you must sit outside. Second, Sangria and/or Constant Buzz is required. Third, dinner comes later at some other establishment  nearby (not that the food is bad... it just isn't why you go to Dominick's).\n\nThe drinks are very strong and still taste super yummy. The end result is invariably ending up more buzzed than you anticipated, and thus invariably having more fun than you anticipated. Also, the laid-back attitude, outdoor seating and afternoon timeframe just make for a relaxed an enjoyable time. What I know is this: mixing my friends with this place always was, and  always still is a great idea.", "type": "review", "business_id": "76STjBw88WDHzfF2YLiJJw"}
