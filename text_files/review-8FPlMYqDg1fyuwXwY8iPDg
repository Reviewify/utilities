The food has been consistently good, and the staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive.\nI've been to the brunch for the past 4 weeks in a row, and although I know they are working out a new menu, they have had consistently good food available and well-presented.  Omlettes, pancakes, & French toast to order, grits, bacon, turkey sausage, fresh fruit have been available each time I've been there.  The changes have been with the meats, although fried chicken was always there.  Salmon, shrimp, spicy beef have been among the various offerings on the buffet.\nI've also been there several times for dinner, and tried different items from the dinner menu each time - from salmon & grouper to a properly-cooked medium-rare ribeye steak.\nIn my opinion, Artistry is a welcome addition to the selection of restaurants in Midtown.  Like several other new locations, all are trying to cope with the times in their own way.\n\nGive Artistry a try, I think you'll like it!!!
