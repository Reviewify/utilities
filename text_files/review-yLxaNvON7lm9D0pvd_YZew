I like Christy's laid back teaching style and her selection of dance routines (a mix of Latin, International, and Pop music).  The playlist was fun to dance to and it was a very good workout!  The facility is not very big but it was fine for the number of people who showed up that day (10-12).  I will definitely go back regularly!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1v4qGcVXGTDK_OMXCsReNw"}
