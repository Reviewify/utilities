However, the \"non cream\" bean soup actually tasted like thinned out puree of refried beans--swear to God.  My arugala salad had wood textured artichoke hearts that had no flavor.  Speaking of flavorless, the special risotto was so bland, it could have been baby food of rice.  Thankfully, the portions are not large.  We did have attentive service though.  \n\nNot going back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wlbTsPLxHom0lYdROsngsA"}
