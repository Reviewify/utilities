We ordered some of the cactus appetizer..YUCK! it tasted like cardboard. The ambiance was nice, but they could have turned the lights down a little. I was a little scared to try Cafe Habana because of the reviews on Yelp, but the service seemed pretty competent. Best Mojitas I've had though!", "business_id": "2vUYE4Pjtgw8rjpPg4RMGg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-23", "type": "review"}
