I've been to worse, but not much.  The food is never great.  Everything is too salty and over-cooked, or cooked poorly.  It's a rare day when I get something from Eddie M's and I actually manage to force it all down.  If you need to customize your order at all, say get a plain sandwich, it's most likely going to be wrong.  They don't apparently have a concept of plain.\n\nMany warnings for individual things.  The tuna salad has onions in it.  The paninis are very salty, the lunch specials look like a good deal unit you eat them, most often the quality is pretty poor.  The salmon sandwich is made with a salmon patty that is pretty grim.  The burgers are pretty meh, though edible if you eat beef and the salads are pretty thin.\n\nWhy do I keep eating there?  It's convenient.  That is the only reason I ever go in there.  There are much better places across the street, but it's a street with a walkway, and it takes too long somedays, and even then, it's a close call.  Walk a bunch, or eat at Eddie M's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fiNQSUU0Fd-FVt8InI4hhg"}
