I've been here before (they do amazing amazing amazing burgers and dogs in the summer during water fire). Yay! We made a reservation for the same day which was nice - and unexpected. They were running about 20 minutes late from the reservation though when we got there (it was at 8:45 we sat around 9:05ish) but that's fine. Had a couple of fab cocktails at the bar first. For a Saturday night, this place is bumping! Full disclosure - i'm not a huge steak lover. I can totally appreciate a good steak but I'm the go-to-a-steak-house-order-the-fish kind of girl. My other half is a  HUGE steak fan so ya know what, why not.  We were sat at a fantastic table - booth and the waiter was awesome. He was funny and could appreciate that we had a few drinks and were in the mood for a tasty dinner. Started off wit the Crock (a huge pot) of french onion soup, followed by green beans, half order of mashed potatoes and half order of au gratin potatoes and I had the swordfish which was awesome. IT WAS A HUGE PIECE OF FISH! YAYAYAYAYAYAY! I love when you totally get your money's worth. My boyfriend had the Filet and was totally in love with it.  Great job Capital Grille! You are by far my favorite Steak House. Nice nice job!", "business_id": "ILLYK1PwY2F5c__Dhycopw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-03-14", "type": "review"}
