I don't remember when or how I first became aware of this place, but it's now a mandatory stop if I'm in town for more than five hours.\n\nAJ's review says it all. Their specialty is beef, dry aged on the premises. One member of my party is from Maryland and is notoriously finicky about her seafood. Fortunately, our (extremely tall) waiter was from Baltimore and swooped in to save us from a mayonnaise-laden crab cake. No problem: the 14 oz filet lived up to its billing, and went well with the creamed spinach and french fried onions.\n\nThe indulgence continued with an extensive wine list, and a dessert cart with options that make you sad to have to choose. We went with the cranberry cobbler, the key lime pie, and the German chocolate cake, all winners.\n\nFor those who have never been: great atmosphere (in a two-level victorian attached to La Tourelle Inn) and impeccable service. Alas, the aforementioned playing card game was discontinued in December after some industrious saboteurs sold a mess of them on craigslist, prompting locals to come in with an astounding poker hand and walk out with $100 worth of steak. And me with my king and five of clubs from 2001!   *sigh*\n\nEat here, and tell your friends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_qGDRfTvIwUqFtI1mGI8Rg"}
