One has to be drunk before coming here to put up with it, I suppose, which would explain why it's only busy after 11.\n\nThe bar is dirty. The food is so-so. The drinks are cheap but not that cheap. The dance floor is super sticky (wtf?). The DJ spins crappy music and doesn't even do a good job of it. There were several 21-year-old creepers on the dance floor trying to cock-block me even though I was with friends and not trying to dance with the women they wish (emphasis on \"wish\") they were going home with. Nastiest bathrooms I've seen/smelled in ages.\n\nAll around yuck! I'd have more fun drinking a 40 with some homeless guys in a nearby alley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0JeXmrEdTrPaOsoj2axTQg"}
