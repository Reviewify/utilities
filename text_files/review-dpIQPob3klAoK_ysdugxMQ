I would have to say though that their food and service can vary according to who's working that day. But for the most part, the dishes I've come to enjoy are always good: Thaiger noodles, Tofu delight, Garlic fried rice, and the Red Curry.  I honestly became a fan here because I found these dishes to be of great taste and it's one of those places that keep you coming back because of it.", "business_id": "J-ZPcFUV3FI1LA6KoMnFzA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-16", "type": "review"}
