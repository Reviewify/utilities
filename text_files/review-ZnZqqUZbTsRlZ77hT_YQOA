That said, Suma is the best sushi you'll find in the area. Perhaps not as \"fresh\" tasting as Ichie often is, nor do they sport the sweet potato tempura of that hole-in-the-wall by Rack 'n' Soul.   Despite its smaller failings, this is perfectly good sushi, and a staple in my own delivery and take-out schedule. Their sushi and rolls are always well-made, and their eel sauce and spicy rolls are particularly good, though the latter is a bit heavy. The vegetable tempura is usually very good, and I highly recommend you try their Zaru Soba (cold buckwheat noodles doused in a soy broth). If you have the appetite, the aforementioned noodles make a fantastic appetizer. I would give this business 5/5 if it weren't for the fact that it's still just run-of-the-mill sushi; however, you're not going to find Japan's best in Morningside Heights.", "business_id": "aZzq3M2xwbNHNSQe2AbAOA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-13", "type": "review"}
