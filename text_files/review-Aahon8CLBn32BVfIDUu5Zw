That price HAD to justify whatever I was going to eat at HH's.  All I had to do to prepare was to set my mind up for some mediocre tasting pizza.  And mediocre it was.  Success.\n\nHungry Howie's is exactly what you'd expect from a chain pizza place.  Bland cheese, bland sauce, bland crust, tender crust, medium thickness.  I was oddly ok with this very average pizza.  I think it's cause as I kept working through my pizzas, the numbers $3.66 kept flashing in my head.\n\nThe flavored crust is a pretty cool gimmick and selling point, but it doesn't add much to the boring crust and texture.  I got the sesame, cajun, and garlic herb.  Of these, the cajun was ok, but it definitely wasn't ragin' with flavor.  The sesame was very boring, and they left the crust really white and uncrisp.  The garlic and herb was ok.  It was very mild, though.\n\nOverall, a good pizza joint for cheap, fast, and novelty pies.  Nothing spectacular, but hey, for less than $4 a pizza?  You got my vote Howie...you got my vote.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LgU9jnnEbiZo99KXrFeJQw"}
