And, what a tasty Jax burger. I hope UT students enjoy the awesome patio in the Fall. Long live Jax! I liked that my soft drink was served in a heavy glass, not the usual plastic in that area, nice touch. Service is above average and the menu is simple yet with plenty of options, including specialty salads you can find at expensive restaurants. Just go and find out how great it is.", "type": "review", "business_id": "T2UJ1qCwH8vTWB6q6I_qWg"}
