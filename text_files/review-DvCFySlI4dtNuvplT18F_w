The meat was tender, good provolone cheese that is melted all the way through on soft french roll. Good flavor on the sandwich.. not too greasy which I normally don't like when the grease has soaked through the bread when its not supposed to be like a french dip sandwich. The only complain I have is that they don't have fries here. I had to settle for some Vics Jalapeno chips which I love and always get at Subway but with a cheesesteak sandwich, I do prefer to have it with some yummy shoe string fries. But that's just me and my two cents on this! lol *Tip: Parking is available with metered parking in front of restaurant or parking structure in between Trader Joes and Jersey Mikes. I know..usually parking is a pain to find in Westwood but it is convenient for this location.", "business_id": "e9CQC0ILYwpmdFqhD6XfhA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-06", "type": "review"}
