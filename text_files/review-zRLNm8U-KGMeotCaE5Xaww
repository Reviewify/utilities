Again, only takes cash. Watch out for the spicy-ness.  I don't like spicy-spicy and the 1 star was a little too spicy (but then again, Thai food is unpredictable). It's a great little place, and I mean little.  Probably only seats about 15-17 people at a time.  Also, it's by the college, so don't think that by going later in the night there will be less of a crowd.  :)", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-15", "type": "review"}
