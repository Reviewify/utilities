I don't like spicy-spicy and the 1 star was a little too spicy (but then again, Thai food is unpredictable).\n\nIt's a great little place, and I mean little.  Probably only seats about 15-17 people at a time. \n\nAlso, it's by the college, so don't think that by going later in the night there will be less of a crowd.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw"}
