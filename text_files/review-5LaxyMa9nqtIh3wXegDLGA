It has a very 'Home\" feeling to it.  This hotel sold me when they mentioned it was dog friendly.  They have a lot of grass for the dogs to walk around in and they have a pet station near the parking lot.   We had a great stay.  The beds were comfortable and the room was hooked up.  It had a fridge, microwave and and a little couch for guests.  We loved that the in room amenities were all free.  A lot of other hotels will charge you for the water in the room.  They also provided us with a bag of popcorn and a bowl in case we wanted to stay in and watch a movie.", "business_id": "EevD53rg1YVe9TwWqHihHA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-29", "type": "review"}
