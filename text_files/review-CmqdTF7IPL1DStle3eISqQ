One of them said Ryan is very good with asian hair. However, I was not impressed at all. I just needed a trim to get rid of the ends, so he did that. I wanted some face framing and side bangs, but he didn't do a great job with that. He asked some other girl who's an assistant there to flat iron my hair. She totally didn't know what she was doing, and she somehow managed to make my hair stick straight at the ends and very bulky on top. I didn't like that look at all. I wouldn't recommend going there. But given all the good reviews, maybe I was out of luck or something with them.", "business_id": "Sh9deiGIHRzvb0_cLd_aew", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-08", "type": "review"}
