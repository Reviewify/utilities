Service was absolutely terrible and the food wasn't that great.  Walked in and waited like 5 minutes to be seated, finally the Hostess sat us outside.  After 20 minutes sitting with no service at all, we asked to be seated inside figuring the service would be faster, but it wasn't.  They seated us upstairs, and then a bachelorette party walked in, turned out they reserved the entire room upstairs and the staff forgot so they asked us to move downstairs, whatever.  We finally got menus and ordered our food after already being there for almost an hour.   We had to ask several times to have our waters filled and for some chips and salsa to munch on while we waited for our dinner.  The food took forever to come, and a portion of the fajitas that I had ordered were delivered to another table, so while everyone else in my party was eating, I had to wait even longer while mine was re-made.  At least hey didn't charge me for the dinner.  The whole experience took almost 3 hours and the food was not that good at all; I've had better fajitas at Tortilla Flats and Chili's.  Next time I'm barhopping in the area and I need some food, I'll go to Whiskey Republic, much better!  Won't go back to Lola's....Ever!", "type": "review", "business_id": "7H5fb4BnnaX3IT4DPb724Q"}
