BELEZA Restaurant &  Lounge is a trendy hotspot in Midtown known for it's Brazilian flair small plates, creative cocktails, incorporating local and organic ingredients. As we entered the door, we were greeted by a friendly host, who escorted us quickly to our table. Bossa Nova, global beats filled the air, as we swayed back n forth in our plush, comfortable chairs.  It's a really cute, well designed..a bit small, however, cozy place to hang out with friends, grab a drink, a quick  bite before or after the theatre. My guests and I, were starved, we decided on the same dish, Moqueca(Bahian Seafood stew, organic coconut milk, organic extra virgin olive oil, Mologueta peppers, cilantro, cashews) it was very good.  To quench our thirst, we decided on a brazilian natural soda(Elderflower with lemon). I must admit, I visited Beleza on Friday also, where I devoured their Acai Sorbet topped with granola, fresh blueberries, and bananas.  If you dig creative cocktails, small plates, funky entertainment on the weekend, Beleza is the place to be!  Its sister restaurant is \"Cuerno\" which is next door, it features Flamenco dancing on Sunday and authentic Spanish tapas. Whatever you decide, you'll enjoy every moment, minute, hour.", "business_id": "3NlMNxNgvTAgSI1rnscaxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}
