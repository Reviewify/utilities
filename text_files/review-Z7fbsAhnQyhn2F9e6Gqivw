For us, the best thing we ordered had to have been the mint tea and grilled red onion. We were thrilled to see they had Cheerwine on tap, though and got refills to go for 'dessert'. I ordered the sardine sandwich, which came out on a crusty roll with a lemon slice and some veggies. I love seafood and fish, but even I had to admit that after half of the sandwich I just couldn't do it anymore. It was just overpowering, even if the first few bites had been flavorful and surprising. The bread was hard to chew and the whole thing started to fall apart. My husband had the Outrageous 'whichburger and said that though it was tasty, it inundated the bun with juice and was very sloppy. However, it was gone within a few minutes. Fries were just alright, passable, but nothing amazing.", "business_id": "zaFnxGccKKKzVPkVoE0M3Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-07", "type": "review"}
