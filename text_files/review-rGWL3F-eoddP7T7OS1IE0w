I tried the pad thai (not bad but not the best) and the duck noodle soup (that was pretty good, I have to admit) but the second time I had the kim chi fried rice (definitely not a Thai dish) and it was alright, but definitely not great. The pad see iew was also just alright. Both were a little on the bland side. I would still go back, but I would stick to other dishes yelpers highly recommend.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oSMpVfjLeSDV2yZzNH0rKw"}
