Why am I going to the Melting Pot? Well, I was there and I was going to make the best of it. There were 6 of us and we were unfortunately seated at a long table verses a round table.....not fun for fondue or conversation. Our waiter was nice, but the service was slow. It took almost 3 hours to have 2 courses. The cheese course was amazing. Dinner; not so much. I would recommend heading here with friends for cheese and dessert courses. Pack your wallet with cash because this is a \"big evening out\" even according to their menu.  Prepare to shower and to launder all of your clothing after a visit.", "business_id": "cv6Rm3cYP6rvIPU1IfQINA", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-01-28", "type": "review"}
