My experience at the Coliseum was by far the worst of 30 years of attending live games. This place is a dump and should be blasted into oblivion as soon as humanly possible.  Being a graduate of a certain small Midwestern university that takes its football very seriously, I was eager to finally attend a game here.  I was prepared to deal with USC's fairweather faithful and their lack of football acumen.  What I was not prepared to deal with was some of the worst sight lines in any stadium I have ever been to.   Note to USC fans.  We all feel sorry for you.  Most of you are too stupid to go to better schools.  I always knew that USC fans were a little lite in the grey matter, but I had no idea that it was short bus level stupidity.  However, I have a simple reading lesson for you.  The sign with the letters \"I\" and \"N\" on the outside of the bathroom spell the word \"IN\".  You are meant to enter this side of the bathroom.  Please e-mail me if you do not know what the word \"enter\" means, because you did not know what a simple two letter word like \"in\" means.  The other door with the letters \"O\" \"U\", and \"T\" spell the word \"OUT\".  This is where you leave the bathroom.  Is this really so difficult?  When it was pointed out to the mental midgets who were causing a ten minute logjam outside the \"out\" door that they were failing to comprehend a concept that most pre-schoolers understand, all that we got was blank stares.   Five dollars for a pretzel?  Really?   Also, it is an Olympic flame.  Keep it lit...all the time!  Don't light it at the start of the 4th quarter.  Squaw Valley manages to get this right.  Take a lesson from them.", "business_id": "F9Xh2eJQNRD29hHIUrTzNw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-10", "type": "review"}
