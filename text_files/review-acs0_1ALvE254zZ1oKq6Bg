The hashbrowns come as chunks of potatoes mixed with grilled peppers and onions but the potatoes arnt shredded.  They were good though.  The steak was a little drier than I would have liked but all in all it was tastey.  It was also a little more expensive than I would like for a breakfast place.  The meals were around $10 depending on what you ordered. I went on a sunday and it was full.  I ate alone so I didnt have to wait long but larger groups definitely were gonna be 20+ min.", "business_id": "xFRBN0lFt8g8XjeYw8kFtQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-16", "type": "review"}
