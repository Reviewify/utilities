Living in Austin, Texas has taught me to appreciate good local places. The ice cream itself doesn't taste all that bad. But it does take forever to get it because the employees have to mix in the ingredients and all that. And I bet they think their size options are clever. Like it, Love it and Gotta Have It? Stupid. Seriously. Why can't I just order a small ice cream without having to be corrected that it's actually called a \"like it\"? Reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where Elaine tries to order popcorn in the movie theater and the sizes start at medium, not small. And the prices are just absolutely ludicrous. I began refusing to go there based solely on this fact. I've considered going to the ones in Austin if I have a coupon, but it just doesn't beat the local custard or self-serve fro yo places down here. And the singing is really, really annoying and incredibly awkward. I imagine the employees hate it just as much though. Take my advice. Go to Custard Cup instead!", "business_id": "X0aBITLKCMj_llgfMcWkFw", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-08-16", "type": "review"}
