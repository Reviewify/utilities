And if you're an average dude, or a fat meathead, maybe you can chow down at least another the same day. I swear today's epic four hour nap was a result of eating the Famous Fred's chicken sandwich. It was about time I tried something from the deli. It was tasty, portions extremely generous--loads of chicken hot off the grill, melted cheese, caramelized onions, the works. I'm always in there anyway grabbing something quick from produce if I don't have time to go to an actual market or pacing the aisle of drinks. Glorious selection of drinks by the way. At least in my experience, I can only find Leninade in specialty stores. Plus, the people working behind the counter are always friendly and awesome, striking up convos here and there.", "business_id": "AGHq9c6BgxBWwnasdCYPQQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-10", "type": "review"}
