And the free WiFi is awesome. And the food does taste pretty good. However, almost 100% of the times I come to this place, service is veeeeeeery slow and servers often don't keep track of what you ordered. My first experience here about a year or so ago, I remember meeting a friend to get some work done in the cafe. I ordered a smoothie - that after 30-45 minutes didn't come. I went up to the register, and asked where my smoothie was. Of course, it was created promptly and I was given my smoothie. Then I was never charged for it, and my server who seemed too busy to deal with me just said that it was on the house. At the time, I said, hey, it's a free drink, whatever. But then I started ordering sandwiches from the place. And every time I have had to ask the staff where my sandwich was and how long it would take. Once, they gave my sandwich to another customer (who happened to order the same thing as me and at about the same time my sandwich was wrapped up and ready to go). It was the customer who noticed my confusion and gave me my sandwich - not the staff. These experiences just make me feel like the management is a little haphazard and I'd rather not deal with it any longer. While the food's decent and the environment is pleasant, the long waits make the less than five minute walk down Mass Ave to Clear Conscience Cafe worth it.", "business_id": "bul_5Ahk_QYLUAJ4Od27jg", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-15", "type": "review"}
