I specifically decided on this place (aside from the fact my work building is pretty much across the street) for the pool. It was great that no one was on the table because there is only one table available. I guess beggars cant be choosers because the table was at an awkward place near people sitting.  It was more of a game making sure we didn't poke anyone with the stick. \n\nThe specials with happy hour aren't anything spectacular. We got the pretzels but they were okay. Aside from the pool table, they also had a cute juke box to select songs. I'm not much of a beer person but my friends seem to like the beers on tap. \n\nSeems like a place to chill out..not really to eat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kBL0Z76KLUxBjvZS2djZzw"}
