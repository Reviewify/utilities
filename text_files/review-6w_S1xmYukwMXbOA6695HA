Had two fabulous baristas who made me a delicious beverage and served up fine \"nommage\" in the form of a quiche and salad.  Food was fresh and tasty - beverage was an amazingly well made custom order. \n\nVery impressed with this place.  Ben O took me here yesterday and I will definitely be going back for more chillaxing and laptop usage. This is an amazingly laid back comfortable place.  Also- seems like a great first date place or to chill and talk with friends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gQjjITQHLhpn6VN99q8BsQ"}
