Had two fabulous baristas who made me a delicious beverage and served up fine \"nommage\" in the form of a quiche and salad. Food was fresh and tasty - beverage was an amazingly well made custom order. Very impressed with this place. Ben O took me here yesterday and I will definitely be going back for more chillaxing and laptop usage. This is an amazingly laid back comfortable place. Also- seems like a great first date place or to chill and talk with friends.", "business_id": "gQjjITQHLhpn6VN99q8BsQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-24", "type": "review"}
