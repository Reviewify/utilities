This place is not the place to go if your specifically looking for Ike's. This place makes Ike's look really bad. The flavoring and quality just doesn't compare to the other Ike's. \n\nService is REALLY slow here, the bread is already soggy when it comes out. If you really want Ike's then I'd suggest going to the redwood shores one or the actual ike's in san francisco. There IS a new one in redwood city as well, never been there so I don't know if its good. \n\nOne thing that's cool about this Ike's is. You can place an order on your iphone and i think even pay. Not really sure how it works, but it's possible.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GqFwgMpqggQgYTco0AbEAg"}
