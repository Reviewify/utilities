Turns out I wouldn't have made it to Amsterdam anyway due to a volcano eruption in Iceland which canceled all the flights so it was somewhat ironic that I ended up at a bar called \"Under the Volcano\" on the same night. Like most bars, the experience is mostly with the company you keep and I had a great time as I was there for the Houston Sigma Chi Alumni Chapter happy hour. The place was perfect for a group our size and there were plenty of corners to break off from the group for side conversations. Service was slow but not unbearable and the bartenders were very friendly (when it was finally your turn to order). Like mentioned the frozen screwdrivers are the drink to have here but there's an adequate number of beers on tap and plenty of specialty drinks as well. What hasn't been mentioned much but what I found to be great was the food. I had a roast beef sandwich with a chimichurri mayo that was excellent! The antipasto plate that was shared among our group was also very good and came with a nice mix of meat, cheese, veggies, & fruit.", "business_id": "fin2G7SmfC2QRfeu7wmnbQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-16", "type": "review"}
