I haven't tasted a variety of items from their menu, just the SLO roll and the garlic edamame, which I loved.  I docked them one star because even though service was fantastic the first time we went, the second time we seemed to be forgotten about quite often by the wait staff, and that's one of my biggest pet peeves.  That's usually what causes me to stop patronizing a place entirely, so we'll see how future visits go.  This place is a little on the intimate side because it's not very big, but the decor is very interesting.  The desserts are delicious!  The rolls are kind of expensive, but they're creative and delicious, so I don't mind.  This is a great place to try if you're looking for out-of-the-ordinary sushi.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2zHPIfZF3-oiPpfaFLwo_Q"}
