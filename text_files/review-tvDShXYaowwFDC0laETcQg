I've come here three times now, and had relatively good results each time foodwise. Out of the dishes I suggest- Beef noodle soup (huge servings, also spicy despite its 'nonspicy' label), Garlic Eggplant, and Honey BBQ Ribs. Make sure you're ordering off the Chinese/Sichuan menu and not the Americanised one. My one issue (other than the fact that almost everything is spicy and their spicy label LIES) is the customer service was horrible the last time I went. It's strange, because the first few times was marked by amazing waitresses, and maybe I just caught one on a bad day. Also, the seafood noodle soup she brought me tasted not nearly as great as the other dishes here. Warning: Unless you're like me and addicted to any and all tangcu spareribs, avoid theirs. Tasted like it might have been refried beforehand- slightly dry and stringy, lots of fat on certain parts. The sauce was droolworthy though.", "business_id": "7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-21", "type": "review"}
