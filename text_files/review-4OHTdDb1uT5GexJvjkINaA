Sometimes the service and the food is great - other times, one or both of these elements are a bit lacking.  But over all, the food is pretty tasty!  I recommend the Avocado and Crab salad as well as their raw sushi/sashimi (the fish has always been really fresh every time I've been).", "business_id": "eqFRLwj2_0v_1y2y8Ur3cg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-04-30", "type": "review"}
