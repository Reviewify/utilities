I got lucky spotting Dosa near me today right in front of Intelligentsia Coffee.  I had to stop.\n\nI got the SHIvA-SHAkTI (1/2 Sweet Potato 1/2 Masala Dosa) and it was very good.  I've never had a Dosa but love Indian.  It really hit the spot.  And the lady that runs it (Leena Deneroff) seems like a very hip chick.\n\nIt came all wrapped up and street ready to eat like a burrito.    \n\nGood stuff.  The hard part is just tracking them down.", "type": "review", "business_id": "NtyjXKWUH_Lc0XEbxhp_1g"}
