And I mean come on. If you don't like 90's music then really you shouldn't be going out dancing, because it is some of the most fun music to dance to ever. Period. This place always has a cover, no matter what time you get there. We were here on a holiday weekend and there was maybe 6 people inside total (the whole front wall is a window so you can be a creeper and look in on the party at any time ha) but the bouncer still wouldn't let us in free. So we left for a bit and then came back right before the long long line started. This place is notorious for having a long line so if you want to come here, you definitely need to come on the early side.  Drinks also aren't the cheapest in the world, so I would try and pregame a little too. But the DJ just spins awesome song after awesome song after awesome song, and you keep wanting to take a break but you just can't! That's the sign of a good dance club. No other details really should be needed to make you want to come here. Just go.", "business_id": "G4K5wXUe3aZ387yS1Gju7A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-08-06", "type": "review"}
