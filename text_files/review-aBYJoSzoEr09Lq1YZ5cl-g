I'm pretty sure that we ordered 80% of all the things on the AYCE menu.  The fish were fabulously fresh and decadent.  For the nigiri, I love how the rice portion was not huge like some other AYCE places.  Personal favorites of mine is the Penn roll and the yellowtail jalapenos roll/hand roll.  There were also drink specials for the night, so you can get a martini or beer with your sushi.  I love this place. FYI the rule of AYCE is that you have to finish everything on your plate or it will be counted at full menu price.  There is no sharing with people not getting AYCE.  It's only on Tuesday starting at 7PM.", "business_id": "3gVSrS4kffGGZT8oXHsIcw", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-29", "type": "review"}
