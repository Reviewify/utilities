(i don't know if it's $130 extra or $130 total, because i decided not to go with contact lens.) however, unlike some other places i've been to, they will fit and refit you until you find the right type of contact lens. i have astigmatism, and they told me that they would order a free trial pair for me, have me try it out for a week, repeat until i found something i was comfortable with. this is great, especially for those of you with difficult prescriptions or astigmatism. they have a parking lot just behind their building, and a security guard to keep watch over your car. the area is kind of run-down, but the staff is friendly, and that makes up for being in the slightly shabby neighborhood.", "business_id": "qQtCjmf_eKw1xi7bm5b1Fw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-11-10", "type": "review"}
