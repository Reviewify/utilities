Then this is the place to come for an eye exam. The standard exam is $55. Walk-ins and appointments welcome!\n\nIf you want a contact lens prescription with that, it'll be $130. (I don't know if it's $130 extra or $130 total, because I decided not to go with contact lens.) However, unlike some other places I've been to, they will fit and refit you until you find the right type of contact lens. I have astigmatism, and they told me that they would order a free trial pair for me, have me try it out for a week, repeat until I found something I was comfortable with. This is great, especially for those of you with difficult prescriptions or astigmatism.\n\nThey have a parking lot just behind their building, and a security guard to keep watch over your car.\n\nThe area is kind of run-down, but the staff is friendly, and that makes up for being in the slightly shabby neighborhood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qQtCjmf_eKw1xi7bm5b1Fw"}
