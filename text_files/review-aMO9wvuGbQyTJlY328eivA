So glad this was near UCLA when I was in college. First of all, there's tons of premieres here so you can basically spot a celebrity here every other week. Once I was in Westwood and saw BUMBLEBEE... from transformers... life-sized and standing in the middle of the street. That was probably the most unique experience. \n\nInside the theater, there's literally like 2,000 seats. They always play the newest/most popular films so sometimes there's lines that wrap all the way around the block to In N Out on the next street down. People are literally ordering a double double in line while waiting for a movie. And you're like \"there is definitely no seats left\". Suprisingly, there are. It's huge in there. And the sound system is pretty good for an old theater. I remember watching 300 in there and it was intense! Last of all, $8 tickets with student discount. In LA.... unheard of.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BhHL2vthE_YdaiP6rElMwQ"}
