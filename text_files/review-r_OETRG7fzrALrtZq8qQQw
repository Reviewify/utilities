This place is amazing. Super cool baristas, latte art, below-factory-price Tazo Chocolate and, of course, $1 teas. \n\nMy favorite drink is the Herbal Spiced Chai with Cayenne Pepper, Cinnamon and Soy Milk. For $1. \n\nCheaper and tastier than Starbucks, Lamont cafe or the Greenhouse cafe, with delicious variety. Sometimes I can't help it and have to come twice in a day. \n\nI spend my weekends crying, mourning that the Gato's not open.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cT8Ifv8aM20pRq9GTw4rlw"}
