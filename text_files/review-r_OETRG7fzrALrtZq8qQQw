Super cool baristas, latte art, below-factory-price Tazo Chocolate and, of course, $1 teas.  My favorite drink is the Herbal Spiced Chai with Cayenne Pepper, Cinnamon and Soy Milk. For $1.  Cheaper and tastier than Starbucks, Lamont cafe or the Greenhouse cafe, with delicious variety. Sometimes I can't help it and have to come twice in a day.  I spend my weekends crying, mourning that the Gato's not open.", "business_id": "cT8Ifv8aM20pRq9GTw4rlw", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-04-09", "type": "review"}
