I'm also unsure why they have 4 photo shoot stalls, but only use 1.5 on average. The staff aren't efficient in the back room development process, because they're back there all at the same time often. Right, wrong, or indifferent, don't schedule appointments because they aren't going to honor them. \n\nFor example, we got there @ 11:30 for a 11:30 appointment, and didn't get into the photo stall until 12:50. \n\nIf you're only concern is cost, and not quality customer service, then this is your place! Otherwise stay far away from this place, especially if you have children who can't wait patiently for (1) hour before the process even starts.\n\nThis review is in reference to the PG Plaza location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LQyynQ3ll_RF3rRYcGHIjQ"}
