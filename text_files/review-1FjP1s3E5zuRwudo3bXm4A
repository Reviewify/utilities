Fraiche serves Blue Bottle coffee ($3) and delicious frozen yogurt (starting at $3) with lots of options for toppings. There aren't too many gluten-free snack options on campus, so this quickly became one of my favorite spots.\n\nIn addition to the natural and chocolate flavors, they usually have seasonal yogurts like mango and pomegranate -- all are delicious but the mango is particularly good.\n\nSince it's located in the student union, there is often a long line here around lunch and they occasionally run out of something. But they stay open well into the evening and staff are always really nice. Definitely give Fraiche a try next time you're on campus.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rPEBinN7NEn8uosusvBarg"}
