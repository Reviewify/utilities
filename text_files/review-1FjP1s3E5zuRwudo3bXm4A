Fraiche serves Blue Bottle coffee ($3) and delicious frozen yogurt (starting at $3) with lots of options for toppings. There aren't too many gluten-free snack options on campus, so this quickly became one of my favorite spots. In addition to the natural and chocolate flavors, they usually have seasonal yogurts like mango and pomegranate -- all are delicious but the mango is particularly good. Since it's located in the student union, there is often a long line here around lunch and they occasionally run out of something. But they stay open well into the evening and staff are always really nice. Definitely give Fraiche a try next time you're on campus.", "business_id": "rPEBinN7NEn8uosusvBarg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-08-02", "type": "review"}
