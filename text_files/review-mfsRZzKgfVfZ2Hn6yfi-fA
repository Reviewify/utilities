It's pretty much the opposite of the Clermont Lounge. For example, the Cheetah serves good food. You should never, ever eat anything at the Clermont. The Cheetah strippers are young and attractive (if not entirely natural). The Clermont strippers are  old and fat. The Cheetah has bathroom attendants. The Clermont has a trough. You get the point. If you want an evening of classy nakedness, go to The Cheetah. And stop at the ATM on your way.", "business_id": "SFMw-muxua94mH5Mp96JJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-01-28", "type": "review"}
