It's pretty much the opposite of the Clermont Lounge.\n\nFor example, the Cheetah serves good food. You should never, ever eat anything at the Clermont.\n\nThe Cheetah strippers are young and attractive (if not entirely natural). The Clermont strippers are  old and fat.\n\nThe Cheetah has bathroom attendants. The Clermont has a trough.\n\nYou get the point. If you want an evening of classy nakedness, go to The Cheetah. And stop at the ATM on your way.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SFMw-muxua94mH5Mp96JJw"}
