Dry cleaning service is always consistent and I have never had a problem. Prices seem fair. The asian girl that's always there may seem unfriendly when she's busy but she can crack a few jokes when she's not, which is always appreciated. Highly recommend for busy moms, students, or anyone else that needs convenience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7H3Ex5ci6bPLWQSis7X0ZA"}
