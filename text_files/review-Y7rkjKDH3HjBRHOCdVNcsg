They have great graphic novels (I am a secret comic book dork-yeah, I know about Mylar covers and was in the corner during X-men movies bemoaning the carnage of story lines and plots) and the set up aint too bad. But there is something off about Million Year that has made me never want to frequent it. Maybe the clerks are kinda rude. Maybe its that the adult graphic novels are right in the same cubby hole as the pornographic adult graphic novels thus me looking at eightball results in me catching the dude next me panting over naked S&M anime. But I just never like going in, despite it being the store that introduced me to Found magazine. I like the New England Comics store in Allston or the Comicopia in Kenmore Sq. better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JE8715ehKeQKVlCd_tBTeg"}
