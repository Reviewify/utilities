Don't let the quaint atmosphere draw you in.  We walked by and it reminded us of a small italian restaurant you would find in Italy and the chef is actually Italian.  I'm guessing they must have ran him out of Italy for providing such bad food.  The service is ok, but the food is terrible.  Prosciutto is closer to a thanksgiving ham than anything representing actual prosciutto. My wife ordered gnocchi, which was closer to mush than it should have been.  I got the seafood soup, and it seemed like he tossed some store bought fish and mussels in with some Ragu. My recommendation is to avoid at all costs.  Not sure how they received a single positive review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1No_yNKrXQjIpPpNruELwQ"}
