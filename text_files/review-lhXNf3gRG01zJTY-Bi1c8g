It was late on a busy Saturday evening and my ever-faithful dining companion/boyfriend and I had decided to stop by for dinner. The \"ho-hum\" attitude of the hostess had already put me in a sour mood, but now, having been seated for 10mins, picked out our drinks, appetizers, AND entrees, and watching all the other tables being waited on EXCEPT us, I was now positively livid. As my boyfriend got up to complain (probably in fear that if I went, I would probably raise an ample amount of hell), I found myself already plotting, against my will, the disappointing review I was going to write for this place. And this was Strike #1. Strike #2 was the Seafood Cake appetizer. It seemed as if, in a frenzy to make up for making us wait, the chefs hurried to put some food on our table...and that's exactly how it ended up tasting. Overly dry. Black, almost burnt on the outside. I didn't enjoy it at all. Then things started to turn around. I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and the salmon was perrrrrrfect. Nice, moist, ridiculously tender. Totally melted in my mouth. I savored each bite. I'm glad I requested the black bean/corn salsa on the side because that salmon was simply divine on its own. Good thing too, since the \"wasabi aioli\" tasted more like ranch dressing than anything. I snagged a bite of my boyfriend's Poblano Lime Chicken entree and it wasn't anything special. He gave it a 3/5 and we both agreed the chicken was too dry. We ended our meal with the Vanilla Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e w/ berries. Probably THE best cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've had to date - it was nice, rich, creamy...and not at all \"egg-y\" tasting like some places (mockingbirdbistro*cough). A shaky start, but a good ending. * AMBIANCE: With a nice bar area, a gorgeously-lit patio, pillow-cushioned bench/booths, and candles & fresh flowers adorning each table, The Raven Grill has the potential to be casual enough to meet with friends for a nice lunch or elegant enough to have a date. The walls are a little bare and the open kitchen's a tad loud, but the restaurant itself feels very cozy. I especially love the French cottage theme in the bathroom - so quaint. * SERVICE: After the whole \"who-the-hell's-our-server\" fiasco, service was great. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive and the manager made sure to check on us several times during the evening, as well. At first, I had this horrible gut-feeling that we were being brushed aside because we happened to be younger than the rest of the crowd, and that disgusted me because a customer who's willing to pay for good service & food is a freaken customer who's willing to pay for good service & food. In the end, though, I'm glad that wasn't the case. This visit to The Raven Grill has been a long-anticipated one and I would've hated to give it a horrible review. But man. That was a little too close for comfort.", "business_id": "JyOh6zIV1sGINuEnzOBckw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-10-22", "type": "review"}
