You go in thinking it will be small or compared to the front area of TKwu next door you rightfully can assume that..and then you go in. \n\nThis is really how you should be wasting your afternoon opposed to be asked at borders if you need help every single moment when you just want to walk around the aisles and hope to find something new to learn, read, or peaks your interest.\n\nIt keeps going and going..I bought cooking books (willams and sonoma!! woohhooo), business books, and some random other books here. They have TONS of books, comics, any subject you can come up with. I like how it is VERRRYYYY organized and they can tell you if they have it or not among these thousands of books..and where you should be looking. If its not there..its not there. Move on to something else! So many unique books or authors here. \n\nStreet parking on thompson is pretty easy and free on sundays. Don't bother with the parking structure unless you know you are just stopping by for a few mins. I doubt that.\n\nThe people are super helpful and perky....YAY for those who don't need plastic bags to carry their books..there have always been atleast 10 other people when I go into this place. The prices aren't bad and the new popular books are in the front.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6m5LruQCbKpdaQ72GYOsaQ"}
