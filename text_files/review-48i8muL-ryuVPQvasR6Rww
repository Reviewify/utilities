Venice CA 90291 Nor can I find an official page for patient grievances for UCLA School of Dentistry. So I am leaving this review here to hopefully deter anyone else experience what I had to go through with patient care of UCLA dental. \nThe office staff and the cleanliness of the office is great. It is beyond satisfactory. \nHowever, I go to dentists to see the dentist. To have someone professional work on my teeth. I see that UCLA offers classes in patient care. Are faculty members who practice on the populace exempt from having civilized manner while practicing?\n\nDr El-Ghareeb is incapable of putting anyone at their comfort. I cannot honestly speak to his skills as a dentist, however when I went in for teeth extraction and asked if he can still extract the tooth if it's infected, he turned to me with disgust on his face and said, \"How can I answer that question? Have I looked at you Ma'm? How can I know if I can extract it if I haven't look at it? Have I looked at it? Have I examine you yet? Have I even looked at it?\" Then he proceeded to discipline (yes discipline) me for 5 minutes about the importance of not believing in urban myth about teeth. I was shocked. I didn't expect him to be nice to me, but at least be civilized.I would not trust him to work on my teeth. His attitude projected hate and disgust towards me as a patient.\nIf you expect to be treated like a human being from a dentist, do not go to see Dr. El-Ghareeb.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r0-kKpbH8gSin3E2hGFezg"}
