I just moved to Seattle so I had to stock up on the basics. And now I know what my regular grocery store will be! \n\nThe thing that really clinched it for me was the do-it-yourself bread slicer in the bakery section. A bread slicer! Awesome! I love buying the schmancy boule-type loaves, but if I try to slice them at home, I end up with uneven, thick wedges that are no good for sandwiches or toast. So this is awesome. Sort of seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen, but I will enjoy it until then. \n\nThe produce is amazing as well, and seemed well-priced. I didn't really explore the deli section, but it is enormous, and they have brown rice sushi.\n\nI'm taking off one star because some of the items were bizarrely overpriced - for instance, there was no pasta under $2/package. But I did just move to Seattle, so maybe those prices are actually standard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XdfBrWp1QTfcvJP_Kp-nQg"}
