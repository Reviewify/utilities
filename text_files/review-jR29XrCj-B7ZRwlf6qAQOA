Their food is good also plus they don't charge you for extra rice or veggies :].. They always have lunch specials that are 6 bucks for food and a drink! That's soo cheap compaired to other places.. Everyday is a different special so don't expect the same special everyday lol. \n\nSeating: if your going to lunch you best get there before 12:30! that place gets packed fast! They do have a lot of seats and tables but it does get packed fast lol. They have two coaches which isn't that bad..\n\nParking: I highly suggest parking on the street and not the parking lot.. yeah it sounds dumb but believe me it's best to park in the street because that parking lot is hard to get in and out of it.. \n\nService: service is good! they're nice and friendly :] \n\nThis is the tea place to do homework they have good size tables to put your books and drinks on :]\n\nSuggestion to the place: not to be mean but can you change the playlist lololol sounds mean but yeah can ya?", "type": "review", "business_id": "u-P19-liN975njJrghDJ3g"}
