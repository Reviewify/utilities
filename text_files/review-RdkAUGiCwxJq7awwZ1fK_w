Wow. She is nothing short of brilliant. She has been working in the industry for years and years, she believes in the product, and cares about making you happy. She explained differences between the mattresses masterfully. She encouraged me to go with what felt right and not with the most expensive mattress. She was willing to work with me with financing. She spent over an hour with me. I even visited her the following night and she spent additional time with me. She looked up availability of mattresses online. She gave me a high-tech bed test to make sure I had the right mattress for my body's needs. She is funny, very very intelligent, and kind. In the end, I decided to wait a month to save up money before making the purchase. She gave me zero pressure. She said that it made perfect sense to do what I had to do. I could not imagine a more positive mattress shopping experience, or shopping experience generally, for that matter. The store is massive, bright, clean, and relaxing. I give Vickie, the store, and the products my highest accolades!", "business_id": "ZGY3tg1ISNMT3w1EcfJ5uA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-24", "type": "review"}
