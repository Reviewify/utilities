Just moved to Austin and my stylist from my old salon did research and suggested I go to Urban Betty based upon their City Search ranking of #1 salon in 2007.  The Yelp reviews were positive, and the salon's website was very helpful in choosing a stylist.  So, off I ventured, hopeful but nervous.   I have very long, thick, curly hair and am totally picky about color/foils/cut (have had way too many bad experiences at even the best/most expensive salons).  Veronica was outstanding and a partial foil/cut of the exact quality was $125 vs. the $360 (!) I paid before I moved here (prices may become slightly higher at some point).  My old stylist sent along my formulas and Veronica was happy to see that he did exactly what she would have done, using all the same high quality products that she does.  To me, this spoke very highly of her experience.   The atmosphere is very welcoming, on the funky side but not in the way that might make you uncomfortable if you yourself aren't that funky (moi).  Veronica was very personable and all the stylists there seemed nice and there was no attitude anywhere.  Little touches like giving you a footstool while you are hanging back over the sink for 10 minutes waiting for a process to take were really nice.   They just set up a system where you can book appts. online.    5 stars all around!", "business_id": "rLJp8JAWaE4Jx04hdJzEhQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-10-15", "type": "review"}
