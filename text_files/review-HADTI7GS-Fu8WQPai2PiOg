The meat was old and dry, the falafel was the type of mix you buy from the store and add water to, the hummus did not even taste like hummus, we left most of our food on the table, payid Samir for his bad food and bed service and left.  We will never ever go back again.  There are many great gyro places few blocks from this Samir guy and they are much better and the prices also are better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FhMXLB9RGE3BgO3F3VKZcw"}
