However, being surrounded by other great bars, Baker St. doesn't really offer much to keep me coming back when I'm in the area. I'd rather go to the bars across the street (Brian O Neills or Little Woodrows).  Aside from that, I do like that they offer drinks for an affordable price. I went on a Saturday and there was a live band that was pretty good. A lot of the songs were hit or miss, though. They can get pretty busy so if you come late, you will probably have a hard time finding a table. They have outdoor seating which is a plus but the live band is inside (although that may be a plus for some). I haven't tried the food so I can't comment on that but from what I saw, it looks pretty good. Parking isn't really an issue if you park in the garage ($10). I usually am able to find a spot outside the stores but sometimes this may take awhile. I'm not sure if they validate your ticket or not and I never have gone through the trouble of finding out. Most of you are already familiar with Baker St. so expect a similar atmosphere compared to other Baker St's but this one has a younger atmosphere being at Rice Village. Overall, a good spot to enjoy some alcohol with the company of friends.", "business_id": "ehUJ9BPE3PpwHGsS3rNvTg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-02-12", "type": "review"}
