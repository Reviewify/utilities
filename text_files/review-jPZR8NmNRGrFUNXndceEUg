I've been meaning to try it for a long time, but I always forget and end up going to the same three places in the neighborhood over and over again. I finally went last night, and it was AMAZING! I had the avocado appetizer and the lamb sausage entree, both for a total $20. There are more items on the regular menu than are offered on the prix fixe, which is too bad... the shrimp appetizer and duck entree among others are not offered with the prix fixe. My companion got the pear appetizer and the squash entree. Anyway, seriously, amazing. I couldn't stop commenting on how tasty the sausage dish was. And I can't believe that it's totally BYOB and they just have wine glasses waiting on the tables for you to bring something to fill them with! Weird, right?", "business_id": "xGos8tSzLwO3J8mEk3z_2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-03-13", "type": "review"}
