The location is good overall. The outdoor seating is great for people watching.  \n\nThe food is so-so. I got the veggie burger with guacamole, mashed potatoes, and falafel plate. The guacamole was dull green, like it was old. They have a good beer selection. The friend I was eating with was not at all impressed with his chicken dish.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WVt2GdaHqZNE5qUIJ7k3Eg"}
