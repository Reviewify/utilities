Its a good haircut at a fair price ($25)...  a step up from \"mediocre clips\" down the street. What I like:      -- Its very close to work, and filling an void in the area    -- It is a real barber shop    -- neck shave     -- no reservation necessary (this may change)    -- good haircut    -- free wifi    -- fax (If I had $.05 every time I needed to fax at my barber) What I don't:    -- Ugly buidling", "business_id": "nIN5STcLvjfMG_Z9zqD-vw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-07", "type": "review"}
