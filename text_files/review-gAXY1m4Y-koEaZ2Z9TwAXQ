Its a good haircut at a fair price ($25)...  a step up from \"mediocre clips\" down the street.\n\nWhat I like:  \n   -- Its very close to work, and filling an void in the area\n   -- It is a real barber shop\n   -- neck shave \n   -- no reservation necessary (this may change)\n   -- good haircut\n   -- free wifi\n   -- fax (If I had $.05 every time I needed to fax at my barber)\nWhat I don't:\n   -- Ugly buidling", "type": "review", "business_id": "nIN5STcLvjfMG_Z9zqD-vw"}
