That was disgusting.\n\nThe staff were rude and when I complained to the manager about how we sat for 25 minutes before we even ordered AND I was served cream well past its expiration date he knocked only 20% off the bill. Also they didn't even replace my tea which now had curdled cream in it. GROSS!", "type": "review", "business_id": "INaAXfbIXtXTB3sSDX8Wow"}
