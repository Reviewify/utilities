It's clean and the service is friendly. But the food is just mediocre. Food: Appetizer: Shrimp in a blanket: Six pieces of shrimp wrapped in rice paper and then deep fried. There's nothing else to it. Crispy summer roll: Tastes like something that I can find from a Chinese buffet. Summer roll: Pretty generic as well. Soup: Sweet and sour vegetable soup with shrimp: This soup was actually decent. The sweet and sour come from pineapple and tomatoes. I've never seen pineapples in a soup, but it actually works pretty well. Khmer noodle soup: Just alright as well.", "business_id": "Jx5PeeSyFYWsP5WZHWypWA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-11", "type": "review"}
