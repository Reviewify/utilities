It's clean and the service is friendly.  But the food is just mediocre.\n\nFood:\n\nAppetizer:\nShrimp in a blanket: Six pieces of shrimp wrapped in rice paper and then deep fried.  There's nothing else to it.\nCrispy summer roll: Tastes like something that I can find from a Chinese buffet.\nSummer roll: Pretty generic as well.\n\nSoup:\nSweet and sour vegetable soup with shrimp: This soup was actually decent.  The sweet and sour come from pineapple and tomatoes.  I've never seen pineapples in a soup, but it actually works pretty well.\n\nKhmer noodle soup: Just alright as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Jx5PeeSyFYWsP5WZHWypWA"}
