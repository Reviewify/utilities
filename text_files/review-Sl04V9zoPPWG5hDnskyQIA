To avoid the wait my friends and I usually order to-go and eat outside. This also avoids the issue of the so-called eclectic decor and incredibly hot stoves. The food, however, is delicious. The swimming rhama is great and the pad thai is unbeatable when your just in the mood for some noodles. My one warning is the spiciness. Food comes on a scale of 0-5, and unlike most restaurants medium is really spicy. Last time I was there I ordered the Pad Thai as a 2, the experience was unpleasant. The noodles were too spicy and the heat overwhelmed all other aspects of the dish. As someone who enjoys spicy food I have to suggest you go mild to really enjoy the complete dish.", "business_id": "9YeSEzr8HZMCuQlAyr8FPw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}
