The wonderful thing about this place is that it opens at 6AM (even though it says 6:30 AM online). The cashiers and employees are really nice and sweet, too!\n\nThe coffee itself is \"okay\". It's not spectacular, but it definitely makes do on early-morning rushes to class. Plus, the location is super convenient- it's just a block from campus!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bccVcVv80u3Rqf3CiPM22A"}
