Our homely beadheaded entourage trundled it's way down the street in hopes that Blue Elephant had more cowbell for our fever.\n\nWe threw the team name in the hat for a sizable table of nine that nearly filled one of the two rooms.  The menu stated, \"Fine Food and Jewelry?\"  Sure enough, hand made jewelery of beaded, turquoise, and general seventies variety adorned the walls and was for sale.  Of course, I was there for the food, so I'm just going to list everything we ordered that was all really good and recommended, including beverages.  Hot chocolate, latte, soy latte, macchiato, nova lox platter, seaside benedict, caprese fried egg sandwich, huevos moboso, and (deep breath) challah french toast.  To be fair, the challah french toast wasn't good - it was a moving work of colorful culinary artistry that's only available at BE on weekends.  The challah bread soaked in egg and served with fruit, pecans, and nutella now haunts me at the thought of ordering french toast elsewhere.  The coffee drinks also deserve special mention.  Eyes across the table lit up with pleasant shock as we passed hot cups around to share flavors.\n\nBlue Elephant is small and easily missed on Wickenden St., but a better breakfast can't be found easily and where else can you pick up jewelry at the same time?", "type": "review", "business_id": "9W-k-SJpyEZF1hmiK8MA5Q"}
