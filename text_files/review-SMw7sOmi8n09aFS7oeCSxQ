Always loved the small plate concept, cause it's always fun to order a bunch of things and share. Started with the gumbo, great flavors with a not too overpowering \"kick,\" and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. Then came the beet salad, tender and flavorful. Pomme frites, awesome!! Our favorite, the scallops with carmelized califlowers and pomegranite seeds, should we order another...\nSome handmade pasta with burrata, broccoli and copa, a little salty, but in a good way. Then we finished with the foie gras, amazing, definitely have to share this because it's so rich. And topped it off with their version of bananas foster and good French press coffee!\n\nOverall a nice experience, almost forgot to mention the wines, their flights are really fun, a great way to experience different wines.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ"}
