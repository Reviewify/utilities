Though it's new and still has room to improve, I'm hopeful that Sugarland will prove to be just that. Recently opened, Sugarland has stayed quite busy. They have a large offering of delicious gelato. I have tried a couple, all of which have been really good. My favorite by far is Roasted Almond, with the pistachio being a close second. They advertise that they have the best coffee in town, too. While I'm not ready to crown them yet, they offer a very good cup. Where I'd like to see this place improve is with its bakery case. There are some tasty items in there, but at first glance it seems quite bare. When I look at a bakery case--especially in a specialty dessert place--I want it to inspire recollections more of Willy Wonka than of your local super market. I got a chance to visit with the owner, though, and my guess is that Sugarland is just getting started.", "business_id": "2HbFfXouEiPG1U-5Z7zoNA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-04", "type": "review"}
