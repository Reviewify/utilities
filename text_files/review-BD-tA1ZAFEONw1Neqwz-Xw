So I need to use them on 2 trips. 1st trip - their machine was down so I couldn't use the deal. So left. 2nd trip - only vanilla was left so I did pick up a dozen. I wanted to buy chocolate as well :-( 3rd trip - empty handed..no caramel cream puffs. I think they have a severe inventory issue! I shouldn't have to keep coming and leaving empty handed....the cream puffs were decent though..hence I gave the store 3 stars...I doubt I'll be back though since it feels like management is neglecting this store.", "business_id": "24c8tiJyX8js_pUpEtW3fA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-10-09", "type": "review"}
