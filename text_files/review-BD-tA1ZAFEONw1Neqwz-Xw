So I need to use them on 2 trips.\n\n1st trip - their machine was down so I couldn't use the deal. So left.\n2nd trip - only vanilla was left so I did pick up a dozen. I wanted to buy chocolate as well :-(\n3rd trip - empty handed..no caramel cream puffs.\n\nI think they have a severe inventory issue! I shouldn't have to keep coming and leaving empty handed....the cream puffs were decent though..hence I gave the store 3 stars...I doubt I'll be back though since it feels like management is neglecting this store.", "type": "review", "business_id": "24c8tiJyX8js_pUpEtW3fA"}
