I've been enjoying their food since 1994, when they were located in the Pasadena Mall (the mall that later became Paseo Colorado). Through the years they have remained consistently good with the fastest service known to man and delicious, reasonably priced plates. Everything is good.  The chicken shawarma, the tender and flavorful beef kabobs, the kefta kabobs, the falafel plate, the chicken kabobs and the wraps are all satisfyingly solid.   All the meats are lean and tasty and all their sides are fresh.  Their tabbouleh, tzatziki, humous and baba ghanoush are all delicious as is the little greek salad, rice pilaf and garlic sauce that come with almost every dish. 5 stars, not for mind-blowing food that can be enjoyed only on special occasions, but for consistently good comfort food that can be enjoyed time and time again.", "business_id": "Rz_EYBuygGYz-xCRZ7042g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-08-17", "type": "review"}
