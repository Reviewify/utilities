The decor is so Korean - and by that, I mean really bright colors and a fun feel.\n\nMy two friends from Korea took me here to thank me for helping them edit & proofread their resume and cover letters. It's gotta be good if the real Koreans like it, right? Everyone was speaking Korean in there...I really felt like I was in Korea again.\n\nWe got 3 dishes to share, including japchae and a rice cake dish (two of my favorite Korean foods), and I thought they were pretty good. But I refrain from giving 4 stars because I've had better - I'm getting to be pretty picky with my Korean foods...my Korean palate is developing now. ;)\n\nI have no idea how much things cost since my it was their treat, but I'd probably go here again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "22yTwTUyMBY3SFu_Hj4NOQ"}
