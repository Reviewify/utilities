The decor is so Korean - and by that, I mean really bright colors and a fun feel. My two friends from Korea took me here to thank me for helping them edit & proofread their resume and cover letters. It's gotta be good if the real Koreans like it, right? Everyone was speaking Korean in there...I really felt like I was in Korea again. We got 3 dishes to share, including japchae and a rice cake dish (two of my favorite Korean foods), and I thought they were pretty good. But I refrain from giving 4 stars because I've had better - I'm getting to be pretty picky with my Korean foods...my Korean palate is developing now. ;) I have no idea how much things cost since my it was their treat, but I'd probably go here again.", "business_id": "22yTwTUyMBY3SFu_Hj4NOQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-21", "type": "review"}
