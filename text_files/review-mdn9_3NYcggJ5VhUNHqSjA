This sandwich is amazing.  I've never had egg salad like this.  The egg is cooked perfectly so that the yolk is ever so slightly runny.  I've tried the turkey sandwich here too, and a couple of other things.  You really can't go wrong.\n\nFor desert: If they have them, the lemon bars are definitely not something you should pass up.  Also the macaroons are great too, especially the sea salt caramel and pistachio ones.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UsrKX2305OkmeI7K7cizjA"}
