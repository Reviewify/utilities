Arroyo & Southwest Caesar are pretty decent salads. DO NOT order ANY steak here. it's not worth the price. i'm not sure if they really know what medium-rare is. if they're charging Sizzl*r's price, i won't be complaining, but they've failed. sorry", "business_id": "Dh3X5NuzAcFZSSl72a5lWg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-04-23", "type": "review"}
