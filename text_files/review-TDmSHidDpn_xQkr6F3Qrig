I mostly have only gone for their $5.75 pitchers of anything, yes ANYTHING, they have on tap. This includes Fireman's 4 and some hefeweizen that is also delicious. This deal is on from 3pm-CLOSE (11pm) everyday everyday everyday!!!!!!!\n\nNo place will ever impress me with a pitcher deal ever, ever again because Dirty's has taken the cake forever.I was so distracted by this special that I never tried their burger, but I tried their appetizers and I'm a huge fan of the fried broccoli!\n\nPleaaaaaaase go here and when you do, try to get something to eat along with your massive pitcher of beer!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uZLrwhCDu8kzv-r39IOa8w"}
