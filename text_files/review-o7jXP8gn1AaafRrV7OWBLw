Even the picky and indecisive card shopper (such as myself) can find plenty of good choices.   Need a present to go along with that card?  You can make a one-stop trip to Kards Unlimited.  There are toys for both kids and adults, gag gifts like beer goggles, books, bath and body products, ornaments and what is my favorite to look at, funky jewelry.  If you're shopping for a literary friend, a bunch of the paper collage-style necklace pendants incorporate literary references (Why, yes, I would like one!).  Even if you're not shopping for a lovable female book nerd, the jewelry is beautiful. The aisles can get cramped with people browsing, but you can't blame them--there's just so much to see.", "business_id": "nytVs5PeKgyRMBeK7TxeSw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-12-06", "type": "review"}
