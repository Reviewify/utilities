The burger I had was really tasty without being a mess to eat in public.  Staff was nice and the decor was pleasant without being too fancy, kitschy, or college-y.  A very nice alternative to all the cheap-o places on campus for a bit more money.  You can take a date here in the evening just as easily as you can chill with friends in the afternoon.", "business_id": "Fv2VLzVj9ATLcTbFehTDjg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-07-27", "type": "review"}
