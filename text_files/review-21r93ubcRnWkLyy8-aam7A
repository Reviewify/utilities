They've really made it into a cool place to see bands play, especially if you get to see them in the back.  I'm just not that into watching bands sitting down, which is how it's set up in the front.  Plus, they have another bar back there, cool.  It's great that they have a huge outdoor patio for smoking and cool tunes in the jukebox.  And again - another bar back there!  So, in all, 3 places to buy drinks, couple places to see bands.  Nice.", "business_id": "j2cYa0F0IU40EE4nh784yQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-09-28", "type": "review"}
