I once went to Middle Kingdom and got a meat filled \"veggie spring roll.\" What I like best is that you can get your food really spicy here, none of this \"American\" spice levels, if you so desire. I love their mushrooms and broccoli and, well, everything. The menu is also quite inventive, with fruit accented meals. I would also recommend taking a look at the dessert menu.
