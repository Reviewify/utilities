The coffee is pretty good, the environment is dim but comfortable, with lots of table space to get studying done. The food is definitely WAY overpriced and not usually worth it. I tried one of their \"gourmet\" burgers last night and was not impressed. The picture on their banner is blatant false advertising -- it's just a stock photo of a cheeseburger, what I received didn't even have the same ingredients. The ciabatta-esque bun was nice but everything else was dry. Should have taken my burger business across the street to A Burger Place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5fWoLchFxXDpudnqSa9lQ"}
