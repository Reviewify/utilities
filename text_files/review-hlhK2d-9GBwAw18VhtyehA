First and foremost, this place is HUGE. There must be thousands of shoes here! Plus, It is brand spankin new so everything is organized and all of the boxes are untouched. I just love when I open a pair of shoes and find all of the tissue paper intact... and I don't care if that makes me sound like a freakshow. \n\nI went here for my lunch break last week and didn't even make it through the whole store. Good job DSW, I will likely be returning at least once a week to scope out your spread.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FzBvUuWaieNwya9NJj6tBQ"}
