Located downstairs in the stamp student union, this co-op is all about organic, home grown, small business good. I really admire their concept, and motivation.  They have their own little shop in the back corner of the store. I really like their hummus sandwiches with chopped carrot, lettuce, tomato and whatever else you want to add to it. Brown rice and tofu is pretty good too, just add a little hot sauce to it and you're good to go.  They also pack the food and keep it in the fridge. If you're in a hurry you can just get it from the fridge and there are two microwaves for you ready. I usually came here for their hummus and veggie sandwiches, but occasionally i got some pretzels, and dried banana.  They also have fresh bagels in the morning, and also a day old bagel that's cheaper. They some good drinks there too. I use to get the green tea there, because I'm a fan of it. Needless to say, this place sold a variety of stuff, and you'd have to explore it. Also, this place only accepts CASH.", "business_id": "vJTLwjG-TpEs-W6bBXHS8A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}
