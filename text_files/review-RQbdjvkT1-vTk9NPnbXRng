Its by far my favorite in the area.  When you have a Ralphs card you get nice rewards every 3 months or so, and it gives you a good discounts on tons of items.  The produce section is fresh and has a lot of variety.   They recently updated their meat selection to be higher quality, which is great.  Steak is almost always on sale, and a lot of times is even 50% off.  Salmon is also typically on sale, and is high quality.  Extra points for having a golden spoon, wells fargo, and a dry cleaner service right there!", "business_id": "JBiHdGSt-e0AuinVxz-Yjw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-28", "type": "review"}
