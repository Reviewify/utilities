What seems safe and boring becomes that place where the cook didn't wash his hands in the restroom (University Teriyaki), and no matter where you go there's a 50/50 chance that the service, food, or atmosphere will make you swear to never set foot inside again. But I digress (obvs). I've decided that eating on The Ave is my punishment for not planning my meals for the week. Luckily, asking my coworkers for recommendations has proved to be a shortcut that dulls the pain, and Sarducci's is pretty solid. My parameters were distance based (closer to 40th than 45th), and though I'm not a big sandwich buff I wasn't disappointed. The half sub combo (with small chips and a drink) was just over $8, and the tip about the bread was 100% correct. Soft without getting goopy or soggy with filling *and* the comfort kind of delicious. The bacon in my sandwich (TBR: Turkey, Bacon, Ranch) was crisp but not burnt, the veggies were fresh and tasty, and the sandwich wasn't drowning in ranch dressing. So yeah, I would definitely swing by here again if I'm too lazy to march up to Thanh Vi for a vietnamese sandwich and grab a Slurpee at 7-11. If you have a 30min lunch, the service is fast enough to get you in and out - just be sure to ignore people waiting for To-Go orders and march right up to the register. p.s. They use LevelUp app - if you're into that kind of mobile payment thing.", "business_id": "RtkSumOcRr4GvRq-oUa2aA", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-01", "type": "review"}
