I went with a few friends, and like any other raves, it was really dirty with empty water bottles everywhere, but the experience was fun. The place is huge. If you have a chance, and the means to, definitely purchase VIP tickets so you could have access to the balcony and the couches...You have noooo idea how tired your legs can get walking around from 8pm to 4am in the morning sober or not sober. It's a great venue, bring good company and prepare to wait in a very very long line if you come too early. For Hardfest, the only bad (or good) depending on who you are is that towards the mid end (think 11pm), they let people in who bribe them for a few dollars. I happened to pay full price (which was nottt cheap by the way), so this was a bit unethical on their part. Although not the venue's fault. Overall, if you are going to Hardfest, enjoy yourself, going sober would minimize your horizons....!", "business_id": "hURkUN-V6cNRDc8iq1ILdA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-10-23", "type": "review"}
