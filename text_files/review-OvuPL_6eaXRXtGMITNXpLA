I had the Mac n cheez vegan with strawberry cheesecake for dessert and the root beer with my meal. My non vegan friend came with and devoured her grilled cheese and banana cream pie. I will be coming back regularly as there are multiple menu items I need to try. So excited about this place! Just walk in and look at someones meal and you will sit down. Or just look at the rotating dessert display and you will probably never leave.", "business_id": "qw5gR8vW7mSOK4VROSwdMA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-28", "type": "review"}
