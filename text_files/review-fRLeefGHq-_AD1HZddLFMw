It amazed me to the point that I had to try this place for myself. Honestly, I really enjoyed this place. The pastry selection is amazing! They have danishes, muffins, fruit turnovers, and every baked good imaginable...well it seemed that way to me...it's great! But I really enjoyed my sandwich. They have the typical deli menu but with different twists. Overall, a little pricey but very tasty!", "type": "review", "business_id": "1EdWZWebate-u52mEhb2jw"}
