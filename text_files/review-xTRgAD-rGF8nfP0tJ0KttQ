I always set an appointment (I've even once called for an appointment two hours ahead of time), so everything runs very smoothly and quickly whenever we visit. Although the price for service is a little high for my student budget (that's why I had to knock down a star), I always get quality service and care for my pooch. My dog is a regular patient of Dr. Kuo (pronounced \"Koo\"), who is very knowledgeable and and friendly. Even though my dog is always scared to visit the vet's office, Dr. Kuo and her staff handle my dog very gently and efficiently. The hospital is also very good on sending postcard reminders of when my dog needs to visit them again. They also send occasional informational emails about pet health (optional), and they use PetPortal/ePetHealth for easy online record keeping of your pet's health. I highly recommend this conveniently located vet hospital if you live in the Rice Village area!", "business_id": "bBTbYQpUvfyPbPdyxVm1pA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-02", "type": "review"}
