Burritos as big as your stomach for $5-$8.  I typically go for two tacos, about the same size as a burrito, though sans rice, for under $5.  Add free hot sauce, or get a side of guac for $1.    \n\nNot even a little bit authentic Mexican, but my pasty-white New England palate doesn't have a damn clue what that is.  There's definitely not much corn-based anything, or mole, or really any seafood besides a shrimp burrito.  I probably had something more authentic in Texas, though even that was surely Tex-Mex, albeit delicious.  \n\nFor now, I don't really care what cuisine Bueno represents, just that it's pretty damn tasty regardless.   \n\nI really have to get on the overeducated whitey train, and have my altruistic, perspective-changing, multi-year hallucinogen journey to a Central or South American country.  I think that was supposed to happen 8-10 years ago in my earlier twenties - oh well.  Then I can better tear into Bueno with a worldly perspective on its shortcomings vis-a-vis Mexican authenticity from the comfort of my parents' house.   \n\nOr I could just continue eating at Bueno and appreciating it for what it is?", "type": "review", "business_id": "i_N21-BF8Lj3ejHEldeWqA"}
