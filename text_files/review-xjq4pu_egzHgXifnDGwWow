Unlike T. Joes, however, prices here are extremely high, so I will be treating the place as my \"splurge market\". The help is friendly, the place looks beautiful, but it is difficult to maneuver with the crowds.\nThe reason I am giving 4 stars is because the $20.00 veal rib chop that I bought and grilled last night was truly outstanding- the best I have had anywhere. That warrants attention. However, the flip side is that some wild Alaskan salmon was very fishy smelling when I unwrapped it. TskTsk. I won't eat it- and even the cats refuse!\nI was SO excited to see Myers lemons in fresh produce  - so I grabbed 2 without even checking the price. Later when I glanced at the receipt- Wow $3.34 for 2 lemons!  'Great cheese selection...surprisingly limited pasta brands selection, coffee good, not outstanding, delicious looking pasties - why do I have to be on a diet? Breads look good, but again you will pay! They do not make the bagels in house sad to say. \nIt is a fun way to spend an hour if you are a FOODIE, but bring your megabucks.\nParking may get to be a major problem with a Walgreens.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n5s4xjB2jwwDHKE2Rj6tXw"}
