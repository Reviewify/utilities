And i'll admit this has been nice in the past on Christmas or Thanksgiving when i've need to get outside for a bit, and Vienna the reliable is there. However. The atmosphere is always a hit or miss, i've always liked to have a good amount of noise when i'm working, and this place can be kind of dead in the afternoons. My biggest complaint is that the drinks are awful, i've worked at a coffee shop before and I can tell by watching and tasting them that it isn't good quality. Torani syrups are usually the red flag for me. If you want excellent coffee try Greyhouse, which is one shop away. And even the desserts seem to have change in recent years, I used to be a fan of the tiramisu.", "business_id": "PzLQ2U8uvPCQVwDkxOzNIw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-27", "type": "review"}
