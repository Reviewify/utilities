What can I say?  It's great. Very well-made, delicious food.  Everything I've had is delicious. (and I've had just about everything on the menu)  Don't forget to ask them for a \"Buy 9, Get Your 10th Pie Free\" card.  No one ever told me about it and I'd probably have a free pizza by now.  I only found out by a small sign behind the counter.  It doesn't matter.  Every pizza I've had is worth it.  Now that it's getting cold, you'll only be able to eat inside and there's only about 6 or 7 tables for 4 people. During the warmer weather, there's a cute outdoor area in the back that can more than double their tables. Not a big place and no where to wait when it's cold.  Just give them your cell phone number and wait in the car.  Big plus: It's a bring your own wine or beer place. The salads are delicious and creative.  The desserts are great.  The dining room is very nicely decorated. (see pics from Yelpers) Highly recommended if you like a nice, brick-oven, artisan pizza and a fine dining level salad.  If you don't bring alcohol, they also have a nice selection of Pellegrino beverages like mineral water, limonata, aranciata and the like.  Just go there.  You'll love it.  Ask for Danielle.  She was and always is very nice.  Everyone is.  The service is great.", "business_id": "6X8LoS2wHZ10Tp1245bTPA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-10", "type": "review"}
