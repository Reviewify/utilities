The place is always filled and always playing a soccer game. They have real china cups for you if you say you're staying.  You can sit here with your friends and watch a soccer/football game. \n \nFOOD:\nItalian style panninis, with a lot of different choices. I come here for lunch maybe once a week, and it is never a disappointment. The sandwiches are pretty filling too. \n\nDRINKS:\nIced Coffee for $1, yes please! Awesome soda selection, full coffee service. \n\nTIPS:\nCome here for a coffee break. \nThey will ice all their coffees in the summer.\nThere's sugar water for coffee and tea in a green wine bottle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "khYxvvCKRiR-wqMSbFzFmg"}
