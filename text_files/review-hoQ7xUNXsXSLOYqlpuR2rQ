PLACE: Small neighborhood coffee shop/ sports bar feel. The place is always filled and always playing a soccer game. They have real china cups for you if you say you're staying.  You can sit here with your friends and watch a soccer/football game.    FOOD: Italian style panninis, with a lot of different choices. I come here for lunch maybe once a week, and it is never a disappointment. The sandwiches are pretty filling too.  DRINKS: Iced Coffee for $1, yes please! Awesome soda selection, full coffee service.  TIPS: Come here for a coffee break.  They will ice all their coffees in the summer. There's sugar water for coffee and tea in a green wine bottle.", "business_id": "khYxvvCKRiR-wqMSbFzFmg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-27", "type": "review"}
