I couldn't find the salad on the menu & ask the attendant if you had salads on the mnu, she abruptly answered no.  I proceeded to look for something else and was being rushed by the attendant.  After placing the order, I pulled up to pay and asked the lady why she was rushing the order, she took the money from me and closed the window without uttering a single word.  I waited for her to come back , asked to speak to a manager and lodged a complaint...the manager apologized profusely and told me that by company policy, they are being timed and need to keep the order to under 60 seconds.  When I got home, my mother removed the sandwitch from the bag, the sub roll was dry, the chicken looked dry and looked like it was from a previous day, there was no mayonaise,  the lettuce and cucumbers were past their shelf life.  Overall, that was a complete nightmare.  I will not go to this store ever...specially given that competition in that area is fierce and customer service is way way better than your store.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XOTnYzcQlYmEnpe4l-SVkg"}
