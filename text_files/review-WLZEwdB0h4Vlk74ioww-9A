This location is always busy and buzzing with people, but like most Chipotle, this location is run with the efficiency of a well-greased machine, not to mention the staff are super friendly and at least the food display area is super clean. Parking can be a pain here, but if you can wait, it is much more worth the wait than Qdoba is, which is next store. I do like the fact that there is an outdoor eating area here, so if it gets too loud inside, you can definitely sit outside with your party. I love that they provide separate bottles of Tabasco hot sauce, chipotle and mild sauces to add some extra kick to whatever your calorie-and-carb-loaded selection is!", "business_id": "dCPyV8XCEyE7pyUgzOCDKA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-04-09", "type": "review"}
