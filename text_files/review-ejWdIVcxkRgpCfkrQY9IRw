I bought one, a bit nervous and a bit excited...\n\nI bit in... and that rich, buttery, flaky goodness was there again!  My tastebuds were soothed, and I'm overjoyed.  Not quite sure why those other (smaller and less well-made) pastries were in the case the last time, but I'm hoping that the quality on these buttery babies stays back up to their normally high standards!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y7mcDkhC2TDxZkfATmZH6w"}
