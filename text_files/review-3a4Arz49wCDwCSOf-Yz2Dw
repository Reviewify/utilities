I've never ordered from the buffet (it doesn't look too good), but they make an a-ok congee (no donuts, unfortunately), reasonably good roast duck & pork, and the fish maw soup is also very nice. It's near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it's not crowded. The interior is kind of beat (drop-ceiling, battered furniture, etc), but I really like the laid-back atmosphere.  This is my favorite place for a secret 90-minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes. Just arrive after 1pm!", "business_id": "74wRr6PP6lbaL1YzUcYGAA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-17", "type": "review"}
