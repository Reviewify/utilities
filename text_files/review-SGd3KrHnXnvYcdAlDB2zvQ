Went in on a Monday night with no crowd. THere's a small parking lot next to or plenty of street parking. It definitely isn't your usual sausage + bun + ketchup + relish + mustard - type of hot dog. Their Hawaiian bread for the bun is a PLUS for sure and the toppings are fresh and plentiful, but what i was unimpressed with was the actual sausage which was no different than than the usual baseball game sausage. I ordered: \"Sooo Cali\" - mixed greens, diced tomato, tempura fried onions, spicy basil aioli, avocado, king's hawaiian bread I think I need to try the gourmet sausages for a re-review.  Also tried the \"Grand Slam\" - smoked bacon, egg, tater tots, king's hawaiian bread. \"Tater tots\" nothing too special \"Sweet Potato Fries\" that were covered in melted blue cheese. A must try!! Overall it's good food at an OK price, but not a fan (yet).", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-26", "type": "review"}
