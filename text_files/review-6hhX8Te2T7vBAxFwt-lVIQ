With the exception of the pad thai, all were pretty mediocre. The pad thai was not very good and tasted nothing like I would expect pad thai to taste. I only made the mistake of dining at the restaurant once and was met with very poor service. If I return, it will be only for pick up or delivery.", "business_id": "jsUTsVpjI5QPtPfaciENHg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-01-10", "type": "review"}
