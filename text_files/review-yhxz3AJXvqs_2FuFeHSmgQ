What they failed to mention is that not all of them actually showed up.\n\nMany of the beers that were represented were dispensed, not by the brewers themselves, but by local businesses that happened to feature those beers.  Thus, there was no opportunity to talk to knowledgeable representatives of the brewers. \n\nThe food was minimal -- no food trucks.  The music was loud and incompatible with good conversation.\n\nI did like the location.  They closed down First Street, outside the Packing House.  It had a great, \"Look, Ma, I'm walking in the street!\" feel.  Too bad they couldn't put a better beer fest in the same location.", "type": "review", "business_id": "weryrLYEmYxSjh1AIYB-sQ"}
