With my garlic knots I ordered a pizza and salad. The salad was good and the pizza was decent but not the best I've had in Atlanta. Slice has a few locations in town but I really liked the Howell Mill Road location because it is spacious, they offer WiFi, and there is an extended lounge area; perfect for relaxing, social gatherings or group meetings.", "business_id": "F3SUSc5hkgZ6TvfRYsgnew", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-12-28", "type": "review"}
