I once heard a rumor that they were closing and I was quite sad (until I realized it was a lie - thank goodness!!). Anyways if you are searching for any cute chotchki (omg.. spelling?) this place will most likely have it. Starting in the food section you can spend so much time going through the aisles looking at all the variety from around the world. They even have little jams (like the kind you get at hotels)! They have quite a fantastic chocolate section as well. I always find cool gifts to give to people here. They also have a lot of wine with nice little descriptions spread all over the store which makes it fun. I definitely leave with more than i need (curse your good marketing strategies)! I would recommend coming here if you are just bored. Its so nice to be able to take your time and roam around - you'll find something for sure!", "business_id": "jeZayOMXs2MUSpt6dFHyNQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-18", "type": "review"}
