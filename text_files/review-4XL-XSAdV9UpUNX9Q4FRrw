Legend has it the cookies are made out of lard. So what? That's the secret ingredient when it comes to baking top notch cookies. An ice cream sandwich is now up from $1.00 to $1.25 (edit 5/30/08 - now $1.75) which is still dirt cheap. A Diddy Dozen is great to pick up while walking through Westwood in case you feel a craving coming in the forseeable future. I hear the brownies are good, but avoid the hot dogs. My favorite cookies are the standard chocolate chip and the white chocolate chip macadamia, but they also have snickerdoodles (cinnamon sugar cookie), oatmeal raisin, M&M, chocolate with white chocolate chips, chocolate with macadamia nuts, peanut butter, white chocolate chip with no macadamia nuts, and chocolate chip with nuts (I think that covers all the types I've seen). The ice cream selections are similar to that of a Rite Aid. Not that there's anything wrong with that. :-D Update: Recently Diddy Reese has begun serving Hawaiian ice which consists of a scoop of vanilla with up to three flavor toppings. I haven't tried it, but it's devilishly cheap. Also, you can get shaved ice a la carte for a buck. Might this be a poorly disguised attempt at cashing in on the sudden popularity of frozen desserts?
