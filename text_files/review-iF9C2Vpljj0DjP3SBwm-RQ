I took the M4 down to 110th Street and went inside.  Since it was about 3:30 the place was empty. Just me and the two ladies behind the counter.  They were having a special, if you ordered a chicken dish you got an extra side for free.  Servers were varying levels of friendly.  The iced tea with lemon and mint was the bomb. I ordered the 3pc fried chicken with mac & cheese, collards, and rice and peas.  I asked for it to go, but I really thought maybe I should have eaten it there so the chicken didn't get soggy. Once back on the M4 towards home, the scent of the fried chicken was making me swoon. I broke into the cornbread to keep me from tearing open the box. At home, I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken wasn't as soggy as I thought it would be having sat in a styrofoam container for an hour. Delicious is not the word!  I ate 2 of the three pieces, intending on saving the rest for tomorrow's lunch, but an hour later I ate the third piece, not able to resist it's call. Mac and cheese was so-so. Collards were great and tender. Rice and peas a little dry but tasty.   When I go back, I will sit down and eat under the sweet black and white picture of the family towards the front of the shop.", "business_id": "4GYc1Ld8r4rGQJKz_Qp07A", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-07-06", "type": "review"}
