When you then go a step further and fill this food truck with Mexican treats, well, I'm head over heels. Each order comes with two tacos (although the sign on the truck does not tell you this), which is slightly shy of a solid lunch portion. My eyes were way bigger than my stomach though, and I ordered the short rib tacos and guacamole and chips. The guacamole was... ok. It tasted like mashed avocado (which, as an avocado lover, is still good). I could have used some diced tomatoes and a squeeze of lime juice but it was still pretty darn tasty. The tacos were spot on. The short rib tacos come with white onion, radish, cilantro, crema, and queso fresco. Although a tad messy, it was one delicious lunch. I needed quite a few napkins though, so be sure to grab some before walking away from the cart. I got there early, the line seemed to border on ridiculous by noon. The actual wait time from ordering to receiving the meal wasn't bad at all, maybe 5 minutes. My one critique: I've never felt so short in my entire life as I did trying to order from this cart. They are a good 4 feet above my eye level, and I felt like I was shouting at the poor girl. Despite that, I'm glad to have this truck in Center City every now and then!", "business_id": "RYr5LkmPx9N1ZkiYkDe3Tw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-12", "type": "review"}
