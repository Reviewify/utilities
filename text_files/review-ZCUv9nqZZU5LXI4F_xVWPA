It was a huge place, and at 12:30 on a Thursday it was packed.  However, with only two waitresses they did well at keeping people served.  What lost major points was that when the Chicken Yellow Curry arrived at our table, it was just barely above room temperature.  Inexcusable.  Of course it's not easy to eat a piping hot Thai plate, but something lacks a plate that's not hot enough.  The rice was undercooked, the salad was S.O.S., but the egg roll was pretty decent.  Overall, I'd say skip it.  My quest for the perfect Thai place lives on!", "business_id": "1w-fe4X85ERlnsdrHspDJw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-04-03", "type": "review"}
