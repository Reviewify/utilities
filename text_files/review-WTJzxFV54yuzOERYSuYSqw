For the sake of comparison:  \n\nTucked into a space about 1/3 the size of Swirll, my beloved Berryline serves about four flavors of frozen yogurt in small, medium and large cups with a choice of about ten toppings at a per-topping fee to hungry Cambridge yogurt eaters.\n\nSwirll offers about eight different flavors out of self-serve dispensers (including such gems as acai berry and green tea) followed by a self-serve toppings bar comprised of fruits, chocolate toppings, candy toppings, cereals, and syrups.  Do what you will within the confines of plastic pint glasses or extra-large tubs--it's all $.43/oz.\n\nBerryline edges out Swirll with respect to quality of yogurt.  Swirll's is a little too sour and non-substantial for my taste, while Berryline's is creamy and appropriately tart.  However, Swirll edges out Berryline with respect to table & chair space (especially those cute orange chairs) and with sheer variety.\n\nI ended up trying New York cheesecake, strawberry, and house blend yogurts topped with caramel, maraschino cherries, blueberries, strawberries, white chocolate chips, Raisinettes and Fruity Pebbles.  I'd scale it back to strawberry yogurt with Fruity Pebbles if I went back--simplicity is better!", "type": "review", "business_id": "wuYH-XgijPSb036Z3r0DQg"}
