After being alive 27 years, I still have not found a record store that compares to PRE. I have DREAMS about this place! A high school staple, the set up was amazing-all these used and new CDs, displayed just so. The vinyl in the back, all the rare singles, the cheap ass cassettes, and the endless supply of cheap overstocked CDs. The real treasure hunt was the promotional discs in boxes. Sitting on teh floor for hours, digging through literally THOUSANDS of promotional CDs, I found some real gems including Radioheads OK Computer before it came out~Whoa! I love you so much Princeton Record Exchange...I would marry you.", "business_id": "eKjyGMNRq1cKwZevkFMaVQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2006-09-19", "type": "review"}
