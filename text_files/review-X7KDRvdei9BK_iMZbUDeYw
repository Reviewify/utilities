This place was founded by Bill Silva in 1949 and the tacos are the best tacos on earth. Carne Asada tacos, you know the little ones you get in Tijuana are fantastic but they just don't compare to Bills flavor. Its hard to describe and totally unique. The tacos are a beef patty with cheese and lettuce that leaves you with the feeling you are in a place from the fifties. Don't go there looking for a gourmet meal, its hamburger stand type food. Greasy, unhealthy, absolutely delicious!", "business_id": "KP-r5SDAeqqNwn865gD3ng", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-05-05", "type": "review"}
