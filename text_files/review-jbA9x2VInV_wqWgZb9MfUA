Clearly these people do not live in Princeton. Anyone who lives in Princeton knows that there are very few decent restaurants in Princeton, and that when a new one appears (which happens very rarely), it should be appreciated. Despite the fact that this restaurant is really expensive for anyone on a student budget, and the portions are only \"reasonable\" in size (a.k.a. \"normal\", in Europe) I give it full marks because the food is worth it. It's a good place to splurge on a good meal, or take a date. The alarmingly red and gold walls actually give the place a very cozy feel, and they do a very nice job of plating and styling their food. Most other places in Princeton, that kind of plating is a cover for mediocre food, but not so here. I can't argue with the vegetarian reviewers who hated the place, because I generally avoid vegetables. The plum duck is fantastic, and the seafood salad is another favorite of mine. (The seafood is delicious enough that I can overlook the salad part.) I also have a soft spot for this restaurant because I accidentally left my favorite pair of sunglasses here before leaving for the summer. They patiently held on to them for months till I could pick them up. I'm a fan.", "business_id": "TWIrHUi2TWF5hWoVwakNAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-05-13", "type": "review"}
