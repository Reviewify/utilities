They tried it and did not like it. I couldn't believe that I made a bad recommendation so I had to go back. And they were right, I don't know what I was smoking that first night but the steak quality was horrible. My boyfriend and I asked for medium and I got medium well and he got WELL DONE. Not only that it took like almost an hour till the food came out BUT they got our side orders wrong so they took it back and we waited another 15 min. When our steaks were made wrong we were like forget it, let's eat, bounce and don't ever come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA"}
