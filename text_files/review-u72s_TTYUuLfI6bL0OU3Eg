Horrifying. She decided to consign a dozen pieces, but could not price them so she gave me a receipt for my dozen items and said it would be a few days before she could price them and she would get back to me. I had a bad feeling about that, if you run this store you should know the market value of clothing and be able to price gun 12 items in 10 minutes.\n\n7 days later, after an unreturned phone call and an email that bounced back from the store email I went to retrieve my items. Again, the same woman was on a personal phone call and made me wait while she gave someone boyfriend advice. \n\nI said I was selling the clothing for a client and we had already lost a week and I had heard nothing and was going to take my clothing elsewhere. No apology was offered, no solutions, she just snapped that there were more people ahead of me with clothes she had to price and handed me my stuff for behind the wreck of a counter and made a show of tearing up my receipt.\n\nA shame, it could be a great shop but this manager has no idea what she's doing, the place is disorganized and poorly kept and she is rude to the people who want to give her clothing to split 50/50. \n\nDon't try to consign here, terrible experience!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DM4e47Y2awqjRnyTq2VsfQ"}
