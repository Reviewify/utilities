Old fashioned mom & pop diner, delicious breakfast and lunch. Super friendly staff who makes you feel like you are home, and very humble about their involvements in multiple Hollywood movies. There are usually very little guests, very relaxing and cozy place to give you a warm start in the morning.", "type": "review", "business_id": "du0tHy1a1XlgLHcOBOxTgg"}
