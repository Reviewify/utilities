And yes the food has gotten better, still not a gastropub, but as a half-decent neighbourhood pub to chill and have a sup it's grand. Head upstairs and join the frat boys & girls for darts, pitchers, & pizza.\n\nAnd they have a trad session on Monday nights, it usually starts at about 9ish. Now, if only they'd carry one or two good Belgium beers or some decent Heffe Weisse then I'd have somewhere to chill when it's too cold to sit outside at the O side.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eJ7mv16H-CimLFk-sWzChg"}
