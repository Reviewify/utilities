I hate when sisig is the selling point for a food truck and it's done poorly. Well, The Discussion Truck shut me up and had me stuffing my face. The sisig fries are legit! The sisig is done right, wining over my traditionalist heart. The pork cracklings, fried egg, thinly sliced pickled scallions, and roasted garlic aioli all work together harmoniously. It all makes sense and tastes delicious.  I'm sold.", "business_id": "l9zbwhElXaaDM_zO_tB1eg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-24", "type": "review"}
