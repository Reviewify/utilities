I gave 3.5 stars for Diddy only because it was too hyped up for me. A couple of friends tried this place out a while ago and suggested it so I was curious to try. It's $1.50 to make your own ice-cream sandwich.. a reasonable price but probably not worth the wait. Luckily, when I went.. there was hardly a line. I ended up getting the choco-chip w/ walnuts and peanut butter cookies with cookies and cream in between. Like a few other yelpers have said.. it's good but not great. If I'm in the area again and craving something cheap and good, I'll stop by here. If not, I surely have a bunch of other sweet spots to hit ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "piXuRfZ81xFGA64WFJrKkQ"}
