The wait wasn't bad at all compared to a weekend.  I've been here several times and and a review is overdue.  I have never had a bad meal here, always yummy yummy deliciousness. It's always nice to indulge yourself once a while with decadence for the mouth and tummy! Today we ordered The Ringer burger and it was absolutely delicious.  My sister ordered one of the hot dogs, can't remember the name, but it has a fried egg with cheese in it, bacon, and maple syrup.  Sounds a bit odd but, but was not bad at all, like a breakfast hot dog.  We also got an order of fries and tots.  The curry ketchup is awesome with the fries and tots. There's plenty of free parking in the building (underground lot can fill up on the weekend) and on the street (one way).  I will definitely be back for more and more and more!", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-07-05", "type": "review"}
