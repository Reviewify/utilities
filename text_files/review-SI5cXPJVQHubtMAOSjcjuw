The owner at one time ownes  Little Italy  off Mesa and Spicewood for over 15 years.  The the slices are quite large and filling.  They cater too the UT crowd and do a good job accommodating the hungry student.  The selection is excellent from plain pepperoni to a slice of white, or spinach and mushroom.  The flavor is good and you can always find the owner in the kitchen working, whether it be  prepping tossing or cocking, Gene is almost always there. You won't be disappointed.  I do believe they should accept credit cards,, just my personal opinion.", "business_id": "cKU-vVsl7f1bKA1T44HlBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-12-28", "type": "review"}
