I arrived here a non coffee drinker functioning off two hours of sleep. I went up to the counter and told the really nice employee that I was looking for a tea that would wake me up. He recommended the English Breakfast tea... TALK ABOUT HIDDEN GEM!\n\nThis English Breakfast tea was strong and amazing. As someone who refuses to try coffee I was very satisfied with the drink and the only thing I added was a hint of honey to take away a bit of the bitter taste. The drink was very reasonably priced (2 bucks!!!) and I will definitely come here more often to both study and grab tea. The space is really nice and there is enough background noise to force you to focus on what it is you're trying to do. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z6V6XF2q8qX5DInYYw17tA"}
