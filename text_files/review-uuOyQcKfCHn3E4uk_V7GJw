The staff here can get overwhelmed and unproductive when the line gets long. And yet, I've been in there when there was NO line, and it still took ten minutes to get someone's attention. One worker was rearranging potato chips behind the register while I waited patiently to order. I give Cosi three stars because, unlike some other folks, I do think it's a cozy place to have coffee (or even a slightly overpriced sandwich.) The booths are a million times better than typical cafe seating. I really love the Cosi flatbread when it's warm and fresh. But it loses it's kick when it sits around for a while---and that's what you're gonna get if you go in when the place is really busy. My favorite used to be the tandoori chicken sandwich. I hope they still have it.", "business_id": "NeY1bH6IKJxnn4YAixibsQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-03-08", "type": "review"}
