I've been going to Paragon for 6 years now.  My hair has never been so healthy and long.  I could never grow long hair before Brenda.  She breath life into a frizzy, unmanagable hair and gave me the gorgeous shinny long hair I always wanted.  Jason is an amazing colorist.  Him and and Brenda work together flawlessly you couldn't ask for a better couple of professional to work on your hair.  I recommended to anyone tired of overprized, pretencious, overcrowded salons!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "H28stpCVCWKQhz2YOXwVQg"}
