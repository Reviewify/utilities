Sososo much better than Fraiche (yuck--no flavor) and Red Mango. The original flavor is both tart and sweet and goes perfectly with mochi and strawberries. Also, the watermelon is pretty good (and half off from 5-7 pm!) as well as the other flavored ones (chocolate is super rich, btw). YUM. I would go here everyday  if I could.  Also, the servers are really nice.", "business_id": "bpV1XOZ3BKoIgEmNWLOc0g", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-07-23", "type": "review"}
