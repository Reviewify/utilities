I've spent an unhealthy amount of time and an unhealthy portion of my paycheck in this gem of a store. Their dvd selection is incredible; you'll find a lot of out of print and obscure dvds on their racks. They could use a few more video games on their shelves but this is a very minor complaint since you can't beat their prices or rental fees! Dave (the head honcho) has a knack of staffing his store with people you want to shoot the breeze with. Definitely a factor in making this store the best DVD/Computer Game store in the SG Valley!", "type": "review", "business_id": "UxjlOsPhAClDuW9Ueg4pdA"}
