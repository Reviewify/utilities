They are mostly classical Italian, such as a yummy ragu' of mushrooms on polenta or a squid with borlotti beans. The wine list was quite varied with a number of not too expensive but delicious organic wines (no head ache next morning despite drinking more than the doctor might approve of). The decor is nothing to write home about, but hey, it was a Burger King until a few years ago, and in the booths there is a nice cozy feeling. The staff is always very pleasant and well informed, and they will cater to my (?) fetish for unchilled water. We really like the place.", "business_id": "CVIXJlbQsikFI9XeElGe1g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-02-22", "type": "review"}
