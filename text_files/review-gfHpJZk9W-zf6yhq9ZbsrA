Gimme is an Ithaca institution.  They serve up amazing, quality coffee drinks and don't get bogged down with superfluous non-coffee crap like bagels and the like.  Their staff is focused on one thing and one thing only: pulling excellent shots of espresso!  YUM! Sadly, the seating in this place stinks which is why I can't give them 5 stars.  Back in the day, they used to have the bar set up in the front with seating in the back.  It was actually possible to hang out with friends over coffee and some conversation.  Now it's turned into \"laptopistan\" and your only recourse is to get a drink to go and maybe drink it in the park next door.   Oh well.....there are worse things I guess.", "business_id": "iwn6dOQTqwP1EUot9DrRYA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-04-09", "type": "review"}
