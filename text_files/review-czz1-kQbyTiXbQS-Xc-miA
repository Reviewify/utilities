I thought the restaurant scene in Pasadena was as good as dead with the exception of a couple of passable joints. This place got the high marks for me because the food was not pretentious and priced just right. I tried the empanadas and they were average. The mushroom soup (soup of the day) was actually really good despite not using chicken stock or cream. The sole was great. I tried the rib eye as well and I thought the sauce could use a little more heat and zing. A little too boringly sweet. The flan hit the spot at the end of the meal. The bread basket really brought the whole experience down. Cold sliced baguettes with a herb infused dipping oil? The oil could have been spiced a little more - too bland and they would have so improved my first impressions if they just heat the bread a little. Will definitely come back to try the flank steak.", "type": "review", "business_id": "D6jDSCivbVSjqmnu1RF3fA"}
