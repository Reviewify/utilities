I dunno there's something about pizza that makes me feel well, not too good.  So the first time I went there we ordered something like the blackened chicken pizza.  It was good.  I mean the crust was reeally good and crunchy and amazing.\n\nAnd the pizzokie.  Pretty good.  \n\nPlus there service was really friendly.
