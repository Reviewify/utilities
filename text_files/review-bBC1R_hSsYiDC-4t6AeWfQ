Then ordered a bunch of items of the Tapas Menu. Got Pan Con Tomate (bread with tomato sauce) which was so good we got a 2nd order. Empanada de Pollo, (chicken empenada) definitely a favorite for me. Alachodas en Salsa (artichoke in sauce) I'm on the fence about this one but it was good. Dateiles con Bacon (bacon wrapped dates) oh these are heaven .. SO GOOD!!! Carne de Vaca al Vino (beef in a white wine sauce) oh man this is another fav of mine!! We sat at the bar so there wasnt a wait and the service was extremely quick!", "business_id": "ynhSJscAI1aumkgEBUsO4A", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-17", "type": "review"}
