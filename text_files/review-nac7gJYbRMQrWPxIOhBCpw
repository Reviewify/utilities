I wouldn't expect a cheap order at the counter italian place to be world class, and it isn't.\n\nBut it is good for such cheap fare. As others have mentioned, the garlic bread is absolutely scrumptious. \n\nI rarely go out of my way to compliment a salad, but the mista salad is really very good, and it's my favorite part of going to Pasta Roma.\n\nThe other food is above average for the price, but not fantastic. Still, this earns four stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qIwISTsz_2DXVqEfuTDYng"}
