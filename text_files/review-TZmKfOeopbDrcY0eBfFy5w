I managed to make it through all the traffic, lights, and shoppers. Turns out they have extended hours for the next few weeks until things died down ... -_- oops. This time, i had to wait an hour (yes, i somehow have a lot of patience lately..)! But because it was near closing, all the flavor of the day were gone already by the time i got to choose my dozen (yes, another dozen! but i swear they aren't all for me). Basically, the only new flavor i tried was the coconut lemon which was actually pretty darn good! It was nice and moist, super soft, moist coconut (shocker! i thought they were going to be dried), the batter not too soft nor was the icing too sweet. Now, my dog is a \"i heart sprinkles\" dog. and he also looks like a girl wearing a brown dog shirt with pink trim. doh. the things i do to my poor dog for the sake of my love of Sprinkles.", "business_id": "VeiGa7h8p1I2yAIfgZjgtw", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-09-27", "type": "review"}
