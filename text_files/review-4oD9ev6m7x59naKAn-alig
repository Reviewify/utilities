Everyone I bring there talks about how they'd never find it on their own, but now that they know it's there, they'll be back. Maybe because the place is small, conversations are easy to eavesdrop on. And for some reason the people I end up sitting next to are always overachievers who make me feel inadequate for not applying to jobs halfways around the world. I don't think they change the dishes around very much, so you pretty much know what you're going to get. Consequently, I can't go there too often because it's all the same. Service has been unspectacular but fine. Also, the last time I went was for a very late lunch, and they never refilled the pampadom! The whole reason I go is for a pompadum fix! Also, they've served vermicelli kheer the last few times, and I just prefer rice kheer. Pro tip: since they bring the naan to your table, they're just going to throw it away if you don't eat it. So fill up on rice (and pompadum, of course), and ask them to wrap the naan up. It freezes well and can be brought back to life in your humble toaster.", "business_id": "XjHwaC53U_xSyAL5-APIVw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-12-07", "type": "review"}
