Pierre, the current owner, took over a few years ago and he's really made some great improvements including: remodeling the entire gym and locker rooms, adding a smoothy bar and rumor has it a spa is going to be added soon. The staff is great and the head personal trainer Pat will definitely push you to blast the most Iron possible.
