The food is all okay but nothing really spectacular.  \n\nThe salad is huge & pretty cheap but the veggies are fresher w/ more variety at Intermezzo.  \nThe fries are good if you like healthy food.  If you like In n Out fries then you probably won't like these. \n\nThings that are good w/ out the need for a disclaimer:\nThe soups (and all dairy free!).\nThe hummus.\nThe speed of your order - lightening fast!\n\nThings you need to know:\n1.  I'm pretty sure they only accept cash.\n2.  Do NOT talk to the painted faced, knitted cap selling crazy woman outside the restaurant!!!  She is crazier than a mo-fo and will never, ever stop talking to you once you're caught in her web of lunacy!\n3.  If you need to use the restroom, tell the cashier and they'll buzz you in.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q0j0-u8WHHczEg5c9DPQKg"}
