We just got tired of being ignored.  every other restaurant we go to, acknowledges us as regulars after we go there week after week.  McKays treated us like strangers every time, week in, week out.  You'd think the manager Gino would say, at least, hello, but nope, not a word.  So in the end, we decided to take our business elsewhere.   There aren't a great many options for food and drinks around USC, but more and more restaurants are coming.  If the business isn't willing to show you they appreciate your business, take your business elsewhere.  McKays is nothing special and they treat you the same way.", "business_id": "44elblyuC9R2DRK0PEf_lg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-08-15", "type": "review"}
