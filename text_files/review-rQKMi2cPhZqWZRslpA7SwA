Not only do they have an excellent selection of books from all genres and categories, but they also have an exceptionally knowledgeable staff when it come to their inventory.  The pricing is fair considering the often near perfect condition of the books and the environment is very inviting for a long browsing session.  If I had to complain about something, it'd be my inability to leave this place without buying something.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Sb0ZSkVBE0_YxG238FNCQQ"}
