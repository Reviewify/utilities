But their garlic naan is so perfectly chewy and tasty. It wasn't exactly the same as the naan I'd had in India, but I guess I just like it better Indian American-style. I'd highly recommend their tikka masala. I wouldn't say it's cramped in there, more like cozy... yet very family-friendly/suitable for larger groups.", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-14", "type": "review"}
