But their garlic naan is so perfectly chewy and tasty.  It wasn't exactly the same as the naan I'd had in India, but I guess I just like it better Indian American-style. I'd highly recommend their tikka masala. \nI wouldn't say it's cramped in there, more like cozy... yet very family-friendly/suitable for larger groups.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg"}
