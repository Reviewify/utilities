NOT HERE IN THIS LINE...\n\nBobby Flay et al opens this upscale certified Angus, ground turkey or chicken breast burger joint right underneath the newest student housing facility on October 13TH.  It is a super success !\n\nWe walked in around 7:30 PM and the line to the order counter was all the way back to the front door.  We ordered two burgers, sweet potato fries and one soft drink. Took our tent sign with our order number and looked for a seat at the counter.   Within twenty minutes our burgers and fries arrived via designated food runners. From that point on, the runners did everything for you including busing your plates and getting refills for your soda or water. Swift and most efficient is what this place is all about.\n\nMy wife ordered the LA Burger medium cooked with avocado relish/ watercress /cheddar cheese & tomato.  My order was a medium rare Philadelphia Burger with provolone cheese/griddled onions & hot peppers. The sweet potato fries come with a honey mustard horseradish sauce.\n\nLike I had mentioned earlier our meal arrived within 20 minutes and in perfect order. Every bite was consistently flavorful and super tender. To mix it up a little we tried all the different sauces in the condiment carriage. Considering it's a certified Angus beef burger... the prices are most reasonable.\n\nI found the experience to be delightful, quick, professional, and a great dining environment and MOST important the food was excellent!  I left with a great feeling that Bobby Flay has lived up to his most renown culinary reputation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QFcp5kT7eHtbLxRiwiekiA"}
