Metro Nails was recommended to me by another Elite Yelper, so I figured it was definitely worth a try. Oh, I am so glad I did!\n\nI hate the phone. Like, really hate it. Especially when I have to call a place I have never been to. Will they sense how awkward I am and not want to do my nails? Well, fear not! Metro Nails' website allows you to make an appointment online! No stuttering over the phone necessary!\n\nMetro Nails just reopened across the street from it's previous location and it is adorable inside. It is also SUPER clean. There was a couple getting pedis for Valentine's Day (the boyfriend was loving every second, can I get a collective \"aaawwww\"?), and as soon as they were done, one of the girls scrubbed out both pedi baths to the point that you could eat out of them! The pedicure baths are gorgeous!\n\nKeang Ly was the woman who did my nails and she was great! I went with the Gel nail polish and it looks amazing! Also, it dries before you leave the salon...nope, I am not kidding. I was able to take my keys out of my purse without cursing myself for screwing up my fresh paint!\n\nMetro Nails, you now have yourself a horribly awkward and very excited client!", "type": "review", "business_id": "AAJ5TmqMK4TUqEHyBrMLXQ"}
