I was nervous to try a new place, but am so happy I went to Savvi. I must say, it is my new place to get my eyebrows waxed. She listened to what I wanted and shaped my brows beautifully. Many salons in the past have not been as attentive and have given me a brow shape that I wasn't fond of.  When the shaping portion was done, she even touched up my make-up because I was going downtown after the appointment and did not want me to have to walk around with red skin. Overall, I highly recommend this spa for eyebrow waxing and I'm sure their other services are just as high quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Q17NkjJTzEyZ9yklbzYRQA"}
