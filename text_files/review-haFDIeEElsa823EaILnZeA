Hoping I can find a similar burger pretty soon in Chicago, and since I don't think Kuma's Corner serves such a burger. And of course, sampled some food from my friends who ate with me(but at the moment can't remember what they ordered), and what they ordered wasn't bad. My burger was easily the single thing I liked the most. Service wasn't good, but they have a wide menu of food(many items border and go above my own definition of expensive, but I know the next person may not necessarily think that) that made it hard for me to initially decide on what to get, and the outdoor patio seating was great. The interior decor is pretty nice(as is their bar area), and I appreciate places that go out of their way to keep their bathrooms clean. I unfortunately could not find their drink menu on their website, but this is the same dinner menu from when I came here: http://www.lemondenyc.com/menu/Dinner.pdf", "business_id": "hD55NUiGDK7STQ8oy9QDPA", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-08", "type": "review"}
