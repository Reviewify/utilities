He says they've done a bunch of UK photos in the past with no issue so I would recommend if you're in the U-District area and you need a UK photo for your visa or passport ask specifically for him to do it. Original: Sadly our UK visa/passport photos didn't pass the UK specifications. The guys were nice and tried their best but they really should turn away folks who need foreign passport/visa photos instead of wasting their time and our money. I had a hard time finding a place for the UK standard visa/passport photo and ended up going to three different places.", "business_id": "E4gLWrcaO9GGhWq3cknKzg", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-01", "type": "review"}
