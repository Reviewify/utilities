He was super responsive to all of our questions and concerns -- we could call, text, or email him any time. As soon as we started working with him, he set us up with daily reports on property listings. He has a great attitude and made us feel important.\n\nYes , a realtor will show you homes. They'll help you find something that works for you. But the *real* value of a realtor becomes apparent during the negotiation and escrow period. That's where Stephen was a godsend to us. We got stuck in appraisal limbo, with two appraisals coming in lower than the price we had offered. Stephen was in contact with our lender, the seller, and the escrow company daily, making sure the deal proceeded. If our lender dragged their feet, he called them and got things moving. The seller's agent got a bit testy because it took so long to get the sale price sorted out and then close on the house, but Stephen developed a good rapport with him and kept him informed. That helped hold our deal together.\n\nStephen's just a class act, and a great person to have as your agent and guide through this hugely important and often stressful process. We definitely recommend him, and would work with him again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n8hld9YldgQm3FnNM9s7LA"}
