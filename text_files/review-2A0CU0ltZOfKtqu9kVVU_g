I'm a bigger fan of the Austin location (which is \"off 6th,\" and more quiet and eclectic), but this one is great as well. Unlike the Austin one, this one is packed, loud, and full of your typical \"bar crowd.\" They have the usual gigantic selection of beers. For the females and non-beer drinkers, I recommend the ciders (of which they have a few) or the Lambic (which is a tangy sweet fermentation). I tried one of the mixed beers (two beers mixed together) last time and was unimpressed. Stick with your favorite tap or try something new. You can't go wrong (unless you go into the bathroom, which is way too small for any two normal human beings).", "business_id": "IUm-Bh9up7n2hQigcylf7w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-08-10", "type": "review"}
