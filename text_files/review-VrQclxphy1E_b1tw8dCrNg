For the ostentatious gravitas of the fare and the accordant prices, it sure did seem like a Fudruckers on the inside.  I saw more bullshit laquered rope knots and wooden plaques on the walls than I saw at the Long John Silvers in Knoxville Tennessee. Not sure what the fuck thats about, but the food was good.  3 stars. Clam chowder that will make you a merman. A lot of people are bitching about the bread here, but I like the bread. However, if you don't like butter, you're pretty much fucked on that front.", "type": "review", "business_id": "umjK84glwdNfnQ82VDx1Zw"}
