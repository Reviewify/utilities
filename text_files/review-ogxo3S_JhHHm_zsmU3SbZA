One of our friends just landed at SeaTac, so we waited on him to order. But when we realized what time it was, two of my other friends ordered and paid first since they had to go. After those two left, the three of us wait for our other friend before ordering. We felt bad because the waitress always came around asking if we need anything. I was going to order the bratwurst sandwich until I saw the sausage plate. It came with German potato salad, sauerkraut, hot peppers, 1 bratwurst, and a giant pretzel. Everything was pretty tasty, although the pretzel was over salted. I only ate half of my plate, and took the rest with me. The leftovers weren't so great. The sausage became hard and dried out. There was a poster on the wall with specials, but the information on there was wrong. Even though it was wrong, the waitress charged us the price it said on the poster. Overall, 3.5 stars for this place.", "business_id": "dM7aCIJT_cWH3BNgMi9dNw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-11", "type": "review"}
