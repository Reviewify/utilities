We came to enjoy our favorite brunch...the migas and the place was packed.  We were seated quickly but were concerned it'd take forever for service.  The assistant manager, Trish, spotted us, came over quickly, took our order, got us chips and salsa right away and our food arrived five minutes later.  Always good food, great service and the staff comes by at least once or twice to ask how everything is at the table.  We'll be back again soon.  They only drawback, they use to have free AAS newspapers in the entryway, but they stopped it.  It was a nice perk, and we always put it back on our way out the door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fL_ilXgNUq_j9vMpZwdcLg"}
