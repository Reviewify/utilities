I have been to birthday dinners there a couple of times because they have a nice semi-private room at the back where you can enjoy your time without annoying other customers.\nFood-wise, I have always enjoyed their French onion soup.  It is so good that I often tell my friends it's better than the ones I have had in France (half-jokingly).  However, it is usually only on their winter menu cycle.  Their sea bass dishes are generally good (sometimes as a special and sometimes in a mixed seafood dish).  The fish is often very moist and juicy while slightly crisp on the outside. My friend also especially asked me to mention the ahi tuna sandwich that we had for lunch once because it's something different from the regular lunch sandwiches.  Another thing I love about Simeon's is how they serve their desserts.  While they might not have the most creative and unique desserts, they serve them in little cups.  Just the right portion for someone like me, who often does not leave enough room for desserts at the end of meals.\nDrink-wise, I like their various wine flights, perfect for someone who wants a taste of the finger lakes wine!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ntH3yiPIjLyMxYDCfY-UUQ"}
