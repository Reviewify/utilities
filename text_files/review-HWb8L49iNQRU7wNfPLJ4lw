My phone service has never been a problem w/ the exception of my 2 vacation weeks. Big deal- I am saving over 50.00 a month with this service. I have had one software problem and soon found out that customer service on the phone is close to impossible, but the in house customer service has been great. Verizon is EQUALLY bad when it comes to on the phone customer service.  Yuri is very helpful-he remembered me even though I haven't been in the store for months!  Maybe I have been just lucky, but my Motorola phone has been dropped numerous times, twice on a hot grille, and it keeps on ticking. As far as I'm concerned, this is a no-brainer.  No hidden charges-everything included.", "business_id": "2VEml2_-LYFmzxIcxwy8Mw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-10", "type": "review"}
