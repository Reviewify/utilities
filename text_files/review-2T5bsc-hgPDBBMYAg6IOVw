I had the Mr. Stivic which featured kielbasa sausage, cole slaw, bbq sauce and some fries. The kielbasa had a good kick to it, and the Hawaiian bun was a genius way to hold all of that greasy goodness. I ate the whole thing... also tried their tots and had so many left over I was tempted to pull a Napoleon Dynamite but decided to be generous and shared it instead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PUyZcKYvrNZLzgRfM9evRg"}
