Finding new meat and veggie combinations that make their already amazing ultra thin crust pizza even more so (bacon and mushrooms are now my fav).  Desserts are now offered; We shared the most amazing apple dumpling with ice cream (thanks for the suggestion Paul!).. so large, two can easily share. Ohh they now serve beer and wine too...!    \n\nA cool look and vibe, great tunes, and really great pizza, salads, pasta and now desserts AND beer... all at prices that won't break you... What else can you ask for?", "type": "review", "business_id": "VrlIP1YgXwvCQlQ1PTExkg"}
