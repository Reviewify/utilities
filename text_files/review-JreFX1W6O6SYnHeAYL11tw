Went with friends and the food, service and wine were all fantastic. Melissa took great care of us.  We tried quite a selection of things between all of us and all were good.  The smoked gouda and poblano pepper soup was fantastic... a real standout.  The scallops were cooked to perfection.  The historic building is such a nice setting.  We'll be back during the holidays.", "business_id": "DAY7bx_a3mAtwb2yrlvyKg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-06", "type": "review"}
