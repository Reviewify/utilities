I am a body-piercing enthusiast but unfortunately I seem to have terrible luck with them sometimes. Every time I have lost a nose ring, had some kind of weird growth on a healing piercing, or even just needed help putting in a new kind of jewelry, Owen has always been as helpful as can be and has always been able to fix any problem with a professional yet friendly attitude. Aside from that, everyone else there is great as well and I would recommend anyone looking for body mods in the Boston area make this their first and only stop!", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FzXdnDqbb0CRf4cYIz8hA"}
