This place is one of many that have sterilized and boxed the whole food and beer experience. Don't let the casual ambience fool you.  Good brew is more earthy and natural than any other adult beverage. Their menu falls short of matching the quality of beer they pour.  I live a block away and I still can't bring myself to make up an excuse to go for a quick bite.  (yes, see those adorable pups in my pic- you will see them getting their daily stroll past the libation garden. People remember them more than me, but I am not sad.  The pups are super cool and they know it.)  Like much of what I have found in Midtown, this place caters to the palate of tourists- \"they will eat anything\" is not a good approach to cooking.    \n\nI go for a beer and to watch \"businessmen\" chugging 8% abv beers with a Jager-back well before quitting time- I really hope they are using the MARTA.  Even though they have \"Beer Geek Tuesday\" this is really a place for beer snobs in my opinion.  I will give it a few stars because I do enjoy its location and the patio will be a nice place to grab a beer when the weather cools.  When I am there, I stick with the cheese dip- it is cheese dip and my expectations are low.  Otherwise, the pizzas, salad, sandwiches, and other small plates have not impressed me.  They list Sublime Donuts as a local pal...now that is a place that does what they do well.   Step up Pint & Plate and be the neighborhood gastropub you have underneath that plastic food you are serving now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1i63faxXI1TQ7pNlLp3IPQ"}
