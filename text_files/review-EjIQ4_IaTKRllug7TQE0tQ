The first item I indulged in was a chocolate cupcake with a huge amount of peanut butter frosting -- yum! Tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup! The cake was very moist, and the frosting was delicious, except it was a little more than I could eat even with a large glass of milk (my tongue was getting stuck to the roof of my mouth.) The next item I tried was an orange cranberry muffin, wonderful! This is the first time I could actually taste the flavor of orange in something labeled \"orange cranberry,\" and there were plenty of pieces of cranberries, not just flakes/crumbs of the fruit. Later, I had a cappuccino and vanilla trifle. That was heavenly! And a must try if you enjoy rich, creamy desserts. Finally, I wrapped up the end of this week with a red velvet cupcake and a vanilla almond cupcake. The red velvet was ok, but I did not care for the cream cheese frosting, something about it was a little off. But the vanilla almond was excellent! The cake portion tasted like angel food and the frosting was light whipped cream with sliced almonds. Reminded me of wedding cake. Overall, I was very surprised with the quality of these treats. The cupcakes and muffins were all so moist and tasted fresh. So many times, bakeries sell you day old goods, not here! I can't wait to come back and try more, but for now I've got to log in some major hours on the treadmill!", "business_id": "Fh2vlptKk8jyedzCDPbXbw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-08-23", "type": "review"}
