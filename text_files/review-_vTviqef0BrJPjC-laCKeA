There was a long line and only one cashier working.  And when I choose to buy a shirt that had no tag, they grab another shirt that costed more and just rung it up and said it was that price.  I told them I found it upstairs under the sales rack, they said well we couldn't find that exact one so it looks like the expensive one so we will charge you for that one.  Here is your total..  ????? There seems to be no one on the floor when you need help.  Dressing room in every single Acrombie and Fitch is always backed up and there is never someone that cares to make sure that people are happy and well taken care of.  Place is always smelling like their perfume.  Which is quit annoying if you don't like that smell.   I do like the clothes for men, and that is where I buy my husband's clothes sometimes.  If you do decide to shop here expect to wait in line for the dressing room and to get run up.", "business_id": "MwkmT8cYBBMV_c9KvoJSog", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-18", "type": "review"}
