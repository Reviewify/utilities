All the times I've been there, it never seems too crowded, and it's always managed to keep its cozy atmosphere. As everyone else has mentioned, the salads are fantastic. I never had anything like them. The assortment of red onions, (unpitted) olives, thinly sliced green bell peppers and lettuce doused in savory dressing... just having typed that out aroused my appetite. The pesto cheese bread is also a personal favorite of mine. Their gyros are delicious, but it would probably be best to get something on the side to fill yourself up a little more. I've had some of the Italian items, such as the spaghetti and fettuccine alfredo. They're good as well, but I much prefer the items I first listed. I haven't tried any of the other menu items, but I plan on making future visits to further my eating experience, and I'm sure I'll still be holding a positive opinion of this establishment with every visit.", "business_id": "YHI5RsnXxsmZcGv-vPMH3w", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-28", "type": "review"}
