Their Indian food seems to shine a little brighter than the rest. The falafel did not. It came on a plate with iceberg lettuce, little sauce, and hardly any tomato or cucumber. The pitas were not fresh. I didn't even finish. I would have given Cedars another star, were it not for the service. Cedars always seems to be busy, so I understand the need to get people in and out in an orderly manner. Upon walking in, I waited for a moment to try to understand the order of how things were done, since none of the people behind the counter acknowledged me. I hestitated, but decided maybe they didn't see me and went up to the counter to put our name on the list. The man who I tried to put my name with got very impatient with me and told me to please just wait. So we did. Without putting our name in. And they ended up seating people who came in after us before us. Boo! The servers were all very nice and attentive, but when it came time to pay the bill, the owner came over and made us leave because he wanted to use our table for another party (with no apologies). In my opinion, you don't kick somebody out who is supporting your restaurant and a paying customer while they are about to pay the check! One of the members of my party was still finishing their drink as well. I've heard of this same situation (getting kicked out once you're finished with your meal when it is busy) happening to others. If you decide to go, make sure you go when it's not peak time and you'll get better service. And definitely go for the Indian food...it's pretty good.", "business_id": "FJlMfEtr7E-uTzUxspuzIg", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-04-05", "type": "review"}
