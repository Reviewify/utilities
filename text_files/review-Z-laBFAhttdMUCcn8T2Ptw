Between us 3 gals, we had 3 lemon drops, 3 entrees and 2 desserts.  We paid about 40 bucks each.  For the quality of food and service received, I'd say that was worth it.   I do believe I will be visiting this establishment again to try another dish.", "business_id": "kAZ1CDYB1W2bZMaQCcoN2g", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-05", "type": "review"}
