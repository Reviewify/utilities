Open 24 hours on Friday/Saturday. Rocks for college kids with few options for late night food. Good place to get something to eat after a game at UMCP. BUMMER: 1. Few healthy choices (and portions) on the menu. 2. When you're just paying for pancakes and eggs, how much should it really cost? 3. Open 24 hours on Friday/Saturday. Think about it. Who's dining or working there in the wee hours of the morning? Besides the college students, it's a pretty motley crew.", "business_id": "-1Jfl_zix9l1RRWOPmzSEQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-23", "type": "review"}
