Cuchi Cuchi gets three stars because although the food was very yummy and very interesting, the service was only so-so. The cocktail offerings were interesting - I ordered a corpse reviver, but it took much too long for them to arrive at the table. Once I had my corpse reviver and a glass of red sangria in hand (one can only order a pitcher so my dining partner had to order enough for all of us), I was happy and excited about the offerings. We ordered a myriad of items hailing from all areas of the world - a Moroccan cous cous dish, an indian lamb, chinese sizzling shrimp, and two \"cuban\" cigars. The cuban cigar is dough wrapped around shredded beef. Absolutely delicious. We rounded off the huge dinner with dessert and practically had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant. \n\nThe decor is confusing - it is supposed to be an old fashioned brothel? Which would explain why the waiters and waitresses looked so ridiculous? I'm not sure. The crazy dresses and fur stoles were less sexy and romantic than absolutely ridiculous and unflattering. \n\nBut all of that doesn't really matter, does it? The food was great and I recommend it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "C7FKNwSUlbUinT9cRSLXHA"}
