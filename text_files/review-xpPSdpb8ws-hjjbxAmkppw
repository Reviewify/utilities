Not more than three bites into an \"ABC\" (avocado, bacon, cheddar + the optional garlic mushrooms), the bun gave up the ghost. The meat itself was so-so, a little dry and lacking on flavor. Minus points as well for their claim of \"goes great with beer\" when they actually had NO beer available when I was there for whatever reason (bad timing I guess). My friend ordered their version of the \"danger dog\" called the Downtown Dog and they forgot to include the key ingredient that makes it such: bacon. To their credit, they gave us a new complete dog. As a compromise, I ordered a root beer on tap, which was okay but a little on the warm side. I've had way better burgers for $8 (25 Degress in Hollywood comes to mind). I don't think I could \"stand\" another visit to the...uh, never mind.", "business_id": "_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-03-19", "type": "review"}
