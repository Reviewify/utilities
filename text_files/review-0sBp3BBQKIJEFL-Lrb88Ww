The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning \"what you like\" or \"what you want\", and yaki meaning \"grilled\" or \"cooked\". It's definitely what I like. The downside of this is, there aren't many places that have this dish. Moving to Seattle I was excited to eat as much of this as possible, However I haven't found a ton of places with it. Boom noodles has it, and it was FABULOUS. It was cooked great, the toppings were interesting, though I admit I am skeptical of how authentic jalapenos are to Japanese cooking. The servers were very nice. We also have spring rolls which were good. Overall, totally worth going back to.", "business_id": "2DEz094o_CZQo2m_rQSoqw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-03", "type": "review"}
