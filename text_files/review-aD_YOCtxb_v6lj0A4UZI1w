The place is small, so I'd recommend getting there when doors open to get a seat (as it's first come first served). But, you don't have to worry you'll get a bad view, because all the views are good. I like the benches in the back myself, since you get a bar to put your drinks on. They say they have a two drink minimum but I've never seen it enforced. Though their menu inside the club is very limited (they take Cash only, btw) the prices aren't too bad. I wish they had at least ONE decent beer for sale though. Miller Lite, Red Stripe, or Laughing SKull Amber, no thanks! My main gripe is that we tried to use the \"Free Drink\" coupon they offered on their website but said it wasn't valid to see \"Stifler's Mom\" Jennifer Coolidge because it was a special event. She's a comedian. How is that a special event from any other weekend? Nothing on the coupon said that.
