As a student with SHIP, I got 50% off and ended up paying $2500 for both eyes plus the cost of an eye exam and eye drops.  I followed their before and after care to the T and they healed really well.  I know have 20/15 in both eyes and love it!  The surgery only takes like 15 minutes and isn't nearly as scary/painful as I was imagining.  I would totally recommend if you have SHIP or a real job :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "C-hFN_9-neNSK9hGsYMhiw"}
