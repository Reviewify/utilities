Despite how I think that SoHa is one of the more ridiculous words to be used to describe a neighborhood, the food here is great.  Prices are reasonable, the pasta is fresh and sauce is great.  Wait time is not too bad either, even though it tends to be busy all the time.  I don't mind the small space..i think it just adds to the cozy atmosphere it seems to be going for.   My friend also managed to finagle a cup or something from one of the waiters which was nice.  My one gripe is that they only accept cash, but that is not a huge deal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w"}
