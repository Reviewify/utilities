So did the coffee. Revelle is a cafeteria, no more no less, but I always had a class that was near by so I bought all kinds of disappointing food items here. Their terriaki chicken dishes tasted like they were just pulled out of the freezer. The coffee is super sweet and made from concentrate. The soup is always creamy, fatty and can cause indigetion. In fact, everything at Revelle taste like it came from a cafeteria, but then again, Revelle Plaza is a cafeteria and a crappy one at that.", "business_id": "5bkqLif__BaKE3uuL4QDPg", "stars": 2, "date": "2006-12-22", "type": "review"}
