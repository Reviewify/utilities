All I can say is they must have paid a lot for that reputation. This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to.\n\nLet's start with the fact that we went on a Sunday and although there were tons of open tables, we waited 15 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we were served bread immediately, but didn't see a server for an additional 12 minutes. By this time we were starving, so we opted for the Sunday Brunch buffet. Buffet is a loose term here, as there was one chafing dish with a little bit of very bland eggs and bacon, and the rest of the food was Mediterranean. Because they have no name cards listing what the food was, we had to try a bit of everything, because we had no idea what the dishes were.\n\nWe came back to our table, and even though my purse and glasses were on the table, the busboy had bussed the table and removed our drinks and utensils. So.....waiting another 8 minutes for new utensils and beverages, we now find out that the food is hideous - actually, it is not edible.\n\nSo......being starving, and upset for having to pay $25 per person for horrible food, we decided that the desserts, (which looked like standard boxed stuff) would have to fill us up. We go back to the buffet, pile up a plate of dessert, and come back to our table. You guessed it - the busboy had once again bussed our table, removing our drinks and utensils. So...........wait another 5 minutes, and now we find out the dessert is as bad as the food.\n\nI have never in my life left a buffet hungry. This is positively the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life. With so many good restaurants in downtown Upland, walk on by when you see this one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ja-xH_xUKBFawH7ZQEeCsw"}
