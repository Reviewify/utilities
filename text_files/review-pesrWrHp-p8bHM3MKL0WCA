The people working in the fish dept. are usually fairly knowledgeable about how to care for my fish, especially if something is wrong.  They are no experts, but they know a lot more than I do.  They have a pretty good selection of tropical and goldfish to purchase.  They will also test your water for free if you bring in a sample.  They have all of the supplies you could ever need for a typical fish tank.  Make sure to become a rewards card member so that you can take advantage of any discounts they have.\n\nThis location has a cat adoption center where you can view the cats in glass cages.  The cats are so sweet and they will let you go inside and hold them if you ask.  One day we will adopt one or two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Hr597HbGWAp9UbF2JyhOgQ"}
