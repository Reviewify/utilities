I brought a stray cat in to be neutered after purchasing the $75 Friends of Animals neutering certificate.  When I came in for the preliminary exam, there was an additional $140 of tests that were \"required\".  When the vet took the cat to the back for bloodwork, she said \"I'll clip her claws for you and throw in some flea stuff\", implying she was doing me this favor.  When I got the bill, there was an additional $15 for the claws and $65 for 3 months of flea stuff!  I was lucky to get out of there for $200, after declining the numerous X-rays, tests, and vaccinations that the vet, the vet technician, and the office manager all tried to guilt me into getting.  When I called back to schedule the actual spaying surgery, they told me it would be an additional $200 for the required overnight stay, additional bloodwork, special cat litter, rabies vaccination, and extra special e-collar!  I wanted to cry.  We're now taking her to the East Side Animal Hospital who will do the Friends of Animals spaying for no additional costs.  I'm so upset about being ripped off by Riverside.  I'll tell everyone I meet not to go there.", "business_id": "YSgPH3iTfSgOM3C7ZxDLLA", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-10-23", "type": "review"}
