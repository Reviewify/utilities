The prices are on the high-side and the food and service are both average-plus. In short, you aren't going to be WOW'd by anything you find at Mayfield, but you will have a tasty meal. Nevertheless, I'd expect something a little better for the price you have to pay. I just had breakfast with my mom at Mayfield today and it cost us $50 (before tip) for two egg plates, three small OJs, and a side of bacon. The food was great, but it would've been almost just as good and half the price at Hobee's across the street. We've also eaten dinner at Mayfield on multiple occasions and have had similar experiences where the food and service don't merit the high prices charged. If you can choose, sit outside or on the right side of the restaurant. The booths on the left side are very close to the bar and have multiple mirrors built into the wood paneling that have come close to making me feel claustrophobic. All this being said, the Mayfield Bakery adjacent to the restaurant is FANTASTIC. Wonderful pastries, sandwiches, and drinks for reasonable(ish) prices. Make sure to try the cranberry sourdough bread - it's to die for! I think that the Mayfield Bakery is the real gem.", "business_id": "0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-05-26", "type": "review"}
