I love all their beds, that you never have to wait or make an appt. I have been using their \"VersaSpa\" ; I VOWED never to use a machine that sprays tan on me after a mystic nightmare back in 00' when they first came out.. But this machine is my new best friend!! It sprays evenly, has not even a tad tint of orange, has 3 different levels of darkness and even dries you off!!!!! (I am a whitey brunette and I use the darkest level - Level 3) I have a membership there which allows me to get about 7 tans for $50...(for airbrush/spray tanning that is really good) I used to only do airbrushing where someone sprayed in on themselves for you; that runs a hefty $30 a pop. I was there today and wish I knew the girls name who helped me, she is still a sales woman but does it in a very \"non-threatening\" way so I don't have to feel bad for saying no! If you ever don't have money on you; they \"charge\" your account which is nice too! PS: The free bottled water is underrated; you barely can use a restroom for free nowadays! I LOVE IT!", "business_id": "HD7UAHS4DhNlUkSmx0ubxw", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-24", "type": "review"}
