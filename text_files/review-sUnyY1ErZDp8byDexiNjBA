There were flies galore.  By galore I mean... probably one fly circling each table - I'd say there were 6 or 7 tables.  Still too many for a place with a closed door and AC!  Their B rating was evident with really filthy floors, fly swarm, and overflowing garbage can.  All of this grossed me out a little too much to fully enjoy my bagel.  \n\nThe bagel itself was tasty... I had it with chicken salad (which I scooped the majority of it off the bagel... I also bit into a bone/cartilage/other random non-edible chicken part which was not a happy surprise) and lettuce (kind of wilted), tomato (not even close to ripe - and it's summer!!), and onion.  I'd assume the cream cheese is the way to go after that failure.  The bagel however was good... my only complaint was that it was actually too salty for an everything bagel.\n\nI also got the Thai Iced Tea which also set off my food alarm (I swear, I'm not OCD) when she poured it out of a used milk jug.  That's just wrong.  Milk jugs are not for storing beverages in a commercial establishment. \n\nI guess I just don't get it... the dirtiness of this establishment outweighs the deliciousness of the bagel.  Sorry Absolute, I'll stick with Murray's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JV5oa5-KGdiWnqrKPoxSug"}
