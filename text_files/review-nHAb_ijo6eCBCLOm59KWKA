For years I've had to withstand Pu Pu Hot Pot's randomly-quality-controlled food, but I've reluctantly stuck with them because they're the cheapest and fastest. Needless to say, I was quite eager to try out Beijing Tokyo and see if I can break my Pu Pu Hot Pot habit. I had my doubts though because I always feel suspicious about \"Chinese-imitating-Japanese\" eating joints.   I ordered some maki from the Chef's Special list, and just to be safe I also ordered salt-peppered pork chop. I also asked for hot sauce to go with the pork chop. To my pleasant surprise, the maki was quite fantastic! Well, not Oiishi quality or anything, but they're just tasty! I was impressed with the creativity displayed in composing the sushi menu. They seem to like using mango a lot. And the pork chop was good too! A bit bony, but tasty. Only Kantin's (at Super 88 Food Connection) and Chinatown's Hong Kong Eatery serve better pork chop. And being Indonesian, I was especially impressed with their chili sauce. It tasted home made, not one of those generic chili-cooked-in-oil sauce, and I thought I could even sniff a hint of mango in there too. Bye bye Pu Pu Hot Pot!", "business_id": "jsUTsVpjI5QPtPfaciENHg", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-05-15", "type": "review"}
