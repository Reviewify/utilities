But, some of the Korean dishes are tasty and I used to really like their California rolls.  So, I was really upset when one day I went for a quick bite to eat during an off-peak time.  The wait-staff were sitting eating, reading newspapers, and talking to each other (an older woman and a younger girl).  After a while my order was taken and I watched as the older woman sets down her newspaper and makes my California roll with her bare, unwashed hands (probably with newsprint still attached).  This included reaching into some bins of crab meat, avocado, and rice to hand form the rolls, plus her thumb to scrape the Wasabi out and onto the plate.  I didn't even know what to do.  I also got some gyoza, which I saw were just frozen ones like you buy at Costco (not surprised), so I knew this was safe to eat from the deep frying action.  I didn't even want to confront the woman about the unsanitary conditions of her sushi making.  I just took it \"to go\" and tossed it in the nearest trash can.  Now I feel sick thinking about eating there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eAtgP6XcUjRVK8dh8foZdQ"}
