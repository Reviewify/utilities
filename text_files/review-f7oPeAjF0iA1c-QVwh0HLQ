You will wake up again with a jolt when you see the bill - any bill, even without the helicopter part. Even if you don't have to worry about money, because your insurance allows you the luxury of this place, think twice: Stanford is a teaching hospital, so a lot of young and as yet incompetent people (students) will gawk at you and try to touch where it hurts, because their professor lets them. These professors still like to be treated and addressed as gods. They never have much time for you on their rounds or if you ask a question; but to make up for inattentiveness, boy, do they like to cut! \"Cut is where the money is,\" they say. We spend a lot of time here when our child had to be operated on his kidney. The operation was not a success, but didn't do any harm either. The surgeon gave us a look that was between a shrug and a smirk, as if to say: You win one, and you lose one. Be happy you came out a draw.\" Nurses were generally helpful; but they are overworked, and they let you have some young volunteers without a degree as long as you're not yet dying or dead.", "business_id": "DNCPRbPzJfaPOrMjtbIlqg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-12-25", "type": "review"}
