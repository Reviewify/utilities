I hate their new lunch menu. They no longer have their iced green tea. The menu itself is super limited - no more 1/2 soup/1/2 sandwich combos, no more soup, just a few sandwiches to choose from. And they only have the choice of 2 flavors of chips? The execution at this particular location is pretty poor too, the last few times I've been there. The order taker forgets my order the second I tell it to him. Today, my bagel thin sandwich wasn't cut and the lettuce is hanging way off the sandwich. Seems like they did some cost savings measures on their recipes too - everything seems a little..blah. Unfortunately, Einstein's is going to be a breakfast only spot for me from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9Adrvr8ycurboVNl7KcKyg"}
