The pasta is fresh, and there is a decent amount of variety with daily specials and their usual menu. Try the pear gorgonzola salad or the bruschetta for appies, and for a main dish, the lamb ragu, gnocchi, lasagna, or pasta with vodka sauce are awesome. I also love the bread and sauce with olives they put on the table after you order, mmm! For dessert, try the chocolate mousse cake. I don't know where they get this stuff, but it is heavenly! Cash only, but well worth the trip to the ATM.", "business_id": "vZ5-JXlJS75k8wmPNS5U5w", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-07-15", "type": "review"}
