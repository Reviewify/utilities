Every time I go here, I go with my BF after a night out and enjoy the escape the Waterfires gives us. Going late night is best because all the crowds are dying down and you can really take in the atmosphere. Such a unique, artful experience right here in RI. If you go and enjoy your time, donate a bit to keep the waterfires going. I do every time, well worth every cent!", "business_id": "Ym45RegOmSidMgZsoMsL1Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-30", "type": "review"}
