Our dialog was as follows:\n\nMe: \"I actually ordered a double.\"\nCook: \"No, you ordered a triple. I heard you.\"\nMe: \"I really didn't.\"\nCook: \"Nope you did. I heard it.\"\nMe: \"...\"\nCook: \"You did, you totally did!\"\n\nI wasn't sure what the big deal was so I shrugged and paid. The food was OK I guess, but the fame of this place eludes me.
