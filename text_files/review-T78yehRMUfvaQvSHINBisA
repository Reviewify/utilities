I asked for a double patty (because they wouldn't let me get a single), they cooked the burgers, but when the fry cook went to charge us, he charged me for a triple. Our dialog was as follows: Me: \"I actually ordered a double.\" Cook: \"No, you ordered a triple. I heard you.\" Me: \"I really didn't.\" Cook: \"Nope you did. I heard it.\" Me: \"...\" Cook: \"You did, you totally did!\" I wasn't sure what the big deal was so I shrugged and paid. The food was OK I guess, but the fame of this place eludes me.
