I live about two minutes away from Westwood, and I remember the day Brandy & Melville opened; of course, when I walked in I didn't know it was the first day. The Westwood Brandy & Melville is placed in a little nook of a store on Weyburn Drive, a place that one may not usually find themselves during a shopping spree. On the first day, there were two massive pink balloon clusters on either side of the doorway. I was with a friend of mine, and I'm in Westwood often enough to notice when something hadn't been there the day before. When I walked in, my jaw dropped: THE CLOTHES WERE ALL FABULOUS.  The family who owns this amazing store is adorable: a mommy, a daddy, and two small italian speaking children - but here's the catch: their daughter looks exactly like the mom, and the son looks exactly like the dad. It's unbelievably adorable, and it gives a really homey, comfy feeling to this amazing boutique. The moment I walked in, they were hospitable and inviting, like it was their own home!  Overall, I cannot help but buy something when I go in: everything is SOOO cute! The couple who owns it now recognizes me every time I come in, they even recognized me at their new store on the Promenade (which is beyond belief perfect!) The clothing is really reasonably priced, which really stands out to me living in Los Angeles.  The clothes are cute, the owners are great people, the price is right, so DEFINITELY go check it out!", "business_id": "J2HIOGxzoHgVU6m9Ikgqcg", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-26", "type": "review"}
