Very professional and helpful staff.  I've always received great service here.  I love how they wrap everything for you and pack it in a box if you want.\n\nBeing a big collector of kitchen gadgets and unique glass cups, Crate and Barrel has a lot to offer for all your kitchen and home needs.  The designs are simple and elegant, yet modern and chic.  Prices are quite moderate in comparison to stores like Sur La Table and most department stores.\n\nGreat place to look for gifts.  Their seasonal stuff is incredibly cute (especially their stuff for the holidays).  Check it out if you're shopping for family and don't know what to get.\n\nParking is really easy and convenient.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dt_GmMfQc9A979wm2axn5w"}
