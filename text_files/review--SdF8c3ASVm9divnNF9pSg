The korean food is another story. It's usually pretty bland and not spicy enough. The service is slow even though they had quite a few people working. But I didn't mind too much as I was just talking with my friends until our food came. What I did mind was that I felt rushed to get out once we got our food since they were pretty crowded. I like the chicken so I might be back but maybe just to go or when it's not packed.", "business_id": "8Mw2PtzFK1YioyzQE1wFxg", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-02-19", "type": "review"}
