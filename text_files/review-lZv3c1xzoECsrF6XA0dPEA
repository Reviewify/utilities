I started coming here over the summer and since then, I've become a regular customer, frequenting the cafe about once a week. I love the tossed chicken caesar salad (dressing on the side, of course) and the turkey noodle soup. The bread is always fresh - both the focaccia and honey wheat varieties are delicious. The coffee drinks are also good and serve as great pick-me-ups on the way to class. And all this is delivered speedily with a smile! While you wait, you also help yourself to some donut samples, admittedly what drew me in.", "business_id": "oCHcaAfAGzrkLAo5jee1eA", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-01-11", "type": "review"}
