I had an emergency repair come up, and needed some place close. This shop came through with fair price, quick service, and a great referall for towing that was both cheap and professional. I think the 1st time I went I was not being fair in my evaluation. A solid, professional independent shop.", "business_id": "aDA24oeGN2jyLqrLzcwoSQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-03-06", "type": "review"}
