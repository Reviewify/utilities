The space is sparse, yes, but my experiences there have proven that its style is more of an intentional simplicity than an oversight. Be it a Yelp Elite Event, during the week for a ping pong game, a big DJ Friday night, or a fundraiser hoedown, The Salon and its staff rises to the occasion and provide great service at the bar and all around the space. I've played ping pong, sat at the picnic tables, and lost at pinball. I've yet to sample a s'more or anything off the snack menu, but I have tried the pickle back shot, several of the specialty drinks, and have purchased a bag or two of the salty Utz snacks chillin' behind the bar. The downstairs dance parties get pretty serious, so be prepared for a sweaty dark room packed with (potentially stinky) bodies. Having worked with Ethan (the owner) on a professional level, and having run into him well into the evening where I teeter on the verge of not-so-sober, I am a huge fan. He is willing to host a myriad of events from at The Salon and that openness gets a wide array of people through the door, allowing the breadth of those who would return on any given night to just grab a drink to continually grow. That's supa smot. All in all, The Salon is a chill space: laid back is its default design, but at ready to host a killer special event.", "business_id": "Nye78ZSNcgyW3nqyTIeDMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-02-19", "type": "review"}
