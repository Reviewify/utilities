It makes a mockery out of Japanese cuisine and even their chicken teriyaki tastes of black bean paste. The food you ask? Cross fodder between Panda Express and supermarket sushi and BAM! Ginza Sushi.  The worst is yet to come. My first and last visit there, the two chinese sushi makers were loudly speaking to each other in chinese in front of these two Americans at the sushi bar, when one of the Americans ask if they're speaking Japanese and they both nod yes and start laughing with each other. I was like WTF? What's worse is that these workers start yelling orders in chinese across the room and they encourage the non-knowers to believe they're authentic Japanese. It's okay to be chinese, just don't try to pass it off to profit more from those that can't tell the difference, and for the sake of humanity don't call black bean chicken teriyaki.   Lesson Learned: Ginza is chinese for \"gullible idiots that can't tell the difference between kung pao and ponzu\"", "business_id": "oKghaWSeK1V-mymgUTxWVQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2007-09-20", "type": "review"}
