The food at Scotty's is all pretty good, but the fried pickles there are the BEST.  The Purdue location has always been my favorite one. \n\nNot a gourmet restaurant, but certainly better than Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday's, etc...the drink specials are pretty good and I can't remember ever having a terrible wait there.  The only thing I really don't like about the West Lafayette Scotty's is the parking situation - it SUCKS - but I don't blame that on Scotty's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h6YJ8ULFYSjVPbe5V9eFuw"}
