There's just TOO MANY places to eat within walking distance!!!  I'm a fatty and Berkeley kept me a fatty =)  All my best memories of my undergraduate weren't about the academics, late-night studying, or random drunken shinanigans (this one happened quite often); They all actually involved going out and exploring the rich diverse culture and cuisines located in the Berkeley area.\n\nOh Cal, how I will miss you =( (As this chapter ends, another one begins: onward ho to Boston!)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0iSN6PgiXKP4oSVL037ATg"}
