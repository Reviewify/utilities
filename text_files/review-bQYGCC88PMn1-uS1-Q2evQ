Because this one located close to my work and Google rating is pretty good, I called them. I believe the doctor I saw was Dr. Kang. The booking process is pretty good. The reception is polite. The dental assistant does not speak good English, so communication is a little problem at first. Nevertheless, X-ray was done in a few minutes by the assistant. Then the Doctor showed up. Without introducing himself, he start to look at my mouth from the back while I lied down. He did not find the real cause of my problem and suspected a sinus infection. It is actually a gum problem. He spent only about 15 second on me and made that wrong conclusion. Next day I wanted to get my X-ray. And they charged me $25 to have a copy. I do not know if all other dentists also charge this ridiculous document fee or not.", "business_id": "Dpnx1BVvW9tnqzqTsUeZlA", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-03-22", "type": "review"}
