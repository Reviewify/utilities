They're like a ball of meat paste.  Needs salt, needs pepper, needs at least one more kind of meat, some cheese, and lots of browning.  But don't let that put you off.  I ordered some pasta with chicken and got almost a whole chicken's worth of meat.  For under $7, it seems it could be cheaper to go here than to make it myself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "crqWT6VmTS-WIq53qMKqOw"}
