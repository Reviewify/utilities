I knew that this boutique was for me as I saw a lot of clothes that I has seen at Nordstrom. So walked up and it was a few minutes after closing. There were still some customers inside that were browsing so I thought that maybe they were open later than stated on the door. As a customer was leaving, I made my way for the door and it was shut and locked in my face by a sales associate. As she walked to the sales counter she laughed and she told the cashier and they both looked at the door and me standing at it and laughed. I was shocked! When I spoke to the owner about the situation, she gave me the most insincere apology I've ever heard.  The sales girl denied to the owner ever having shut and locked the door in my face. As I said, the clothes were cute but that's all I know because they wouldn't let me in.", "business_id": "DWFeZdK3MTypEZC70RP78w", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-12", "type": "review"}
