We had saved and budgeted for this night, and wanted it to be so special. He made the reservation four days in advance, and we walked over a little early in order to have a drink at the bar. The male manager at the door looked us up and down, didn't say hello or greet us with even a smile (maybe he was too busy?!?) and in general was clearly not impressed with us, moving past to talk cordially with an elderly couple hobbling up the stairs. We were paying customers too! That guy was the first suck factor right there. Anyway, finally we sat. I'll agree with the girl who noted that her server just didn't seem clean --- I noticed that most of the servers rushed around in stained shirts and one guy smelled horribly of BO!! Now someone just needs to say something there. We had what seemed like 4 different servers, and were asked for our order 4 separate times! My drink order was forgotten, though my boyfriend received his beer. Our food came sporadically-- my salad last!! And we were tossed the check before we had time to order dessert. Clearly none of the servers were professionals-- in fact, only our busser seemed legit, noticing when I didn't have a drink, refilling our water and checking in periodically. Why wasn't he our server?? I felt like crying as we walked out, and I felt terrible for my boyfriend, who quietly paid the check. Lastly, as we were walking out we overheard that same haughty manager speaking sharply to the very busser who had treated us so well!! How unprofessional! Clearly this place needs to re-evalute their staff. Overall, the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.", "business_id": "jI4yOYZ7nZt1Yv_9GolxYg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-03-10", "type": "review"}
