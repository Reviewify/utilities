He is kind, patient, caring, and very professional. He listens attentively and goes out of his way to ensure that you experience as little pain (or no pain) as possible. He has the latest technology in his office to offer his patients the best and latest treatments available. His staff is also very friendly and helpful. They take care of all the paperwork and insurance-related documents. I cannot say enough great things about this man (and his staff). I do not know what I am going to do when he decides to retire. If you are looking for a great dentist in the Pasadena area or in the Los Angeles area, give him a call. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.", "business_id": "EdB_E_uQgHvPjlEdGOOgwQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-01-14", "type": "review"}
