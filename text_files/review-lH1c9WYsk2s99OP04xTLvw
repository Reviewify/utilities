The location is small and cozy, with seating for about 12 ppl.  Granada offers imported wines (nothing local), a few select beers (also imports) on tap, and a limited menu.\n\nThe ambience is fantastic, with comfortable seating and an excellent soundtrack in the background.  The decorations are retro-, jazz bar.  I especially liked that each guest is served a unique wine glass.\n\nWine choices range from the very economical to the quite expensive.  I tried 3 wines, and they all were excellent, but the Cotes-du-Rhone was particularly good -- hurry, the owner will frequently rotate her offerings!\n\nI haven't tried the food (I'll update when I have), but the offerings can best be described as light fare.  Choices are limited, but I suspect the menu will evolve.\n\nThe biggest advantage is that this is just about the only non-meat-market, non-college-student bar/nightspot in town.  The biggest disadvantage is the very small size (can easily get overcrowded).\n\nSo far, so good.  Keep it up, Kim!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DVuM5Lca3dIPoEMaD89Qjw"}
