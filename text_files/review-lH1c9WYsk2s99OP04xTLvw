The location is small and cozy, with seating for about 12 ppl. Granada offers imported wines (nothing local), a few select beers (also imports) on tap, and a limited menu. The ambience is fantastic, with comfortable seating and an excellent soundtrack in the background. The decorations are retro-, jazz bar. I especially liked that each guest is served a unique wine glass. Wine choices range from the very economical to the quite expensive. I tried 3 wines, and they all were excellent, but the Cotes-du-Rhone was particularly good -- hurry, the owner will frequently rotate her offerings! I haven't tried the food (I'll update when I have), but the offerings can best be described as light fare. Choices are limited, but I suspect the menu will evolve. The biggest advantage is that this is just about the only non-meat-market, non-college-student bar/nightspot in town. The biggest disadvantage is the very small size (can easily get overcrowded). So far, so good. Keep it up, Kim!", "business_id": "DVuM5Lca3dIPoEMaD89Qjw", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-05-04", "type": "review"}
