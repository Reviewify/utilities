If you love thin crust by the slice (which I just so happen to adore folding myself a pizza taco) and pizza that tastes fairly delicious (I've had far better, Fassolinis in Redding CA) then this is the place for you. It's a good slice of pizza for a really good price and the people are friendly, even at midnight after a TMBG concert at Royce Hall. Plus if you keep yourself to one slice you have plenty of room & calories (aah, the joys of thin crust) for some yogurt land (right across the street on lindbrook). Almost forgot, boyfriend had the plain cheese and I had the grilled vegetable. It had whole cloves of garlic on it. It doesn't get much better than that folks.", "business_id": "t5Ggj9n2ApvawNWTXvwMAg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-22", "type": "review"}
