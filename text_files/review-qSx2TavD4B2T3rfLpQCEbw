However, their meat patties are so thin you have to get at least a double-double or a triple-triple to get something that actually resembles a cheeseburger. And buy the time you do that, the cost ends up going way above what you should pay for a fast food burger. Their fries are absolutely mediocre, I have had better fries at a million places, including lots of other fast food restaurants. The one delicious thing they do have = milkshakes. And the staff is always very friendly.", "business_id": "tIIof6-zqlgxImFNDEIj9g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-05-27", "type": "review"}
