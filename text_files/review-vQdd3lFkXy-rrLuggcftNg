All I wanted when I stopped in was an order of stuffed grape leaves, which came with a side of pita and tzatziki sauce, which I realized got all over the container once I opened it.  Tzatziki is a bit too sour for my taste, but the grape leaves were good, as was the pita.  I'm willing to come in again and try their other selections!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ADe114o7Z4vb1O6HkM6YEA"}
