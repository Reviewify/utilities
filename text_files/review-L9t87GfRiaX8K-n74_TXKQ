We needed something to absorb the mess we just swallowed. This joint was just up the street and Mexican sounded perfect at that point.  Bad news was .. This place was dirty, dirty, dirty. The tables were sticky, there was a big bug on the counter, and the floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in weeks. It doesn't help that this place is the size of my own kitchen a home, which helped to point out all its flaws.   Good news was.. However, they made some pretty delicious food. I ordered the  chicken quesadilla which was huge and packed with my choice of add ons. The medium salsa was working for me as well.  BUT... What you see is what you get ! I saw dirty and chances are what I got was dirty. I won't go out of my way to stop in here again. My advise to people who live in this area:  Send someone else out to pick it up and eat it on your own clean table and shiny floor.", "business_id": "C6ffz9ppgZHB9t1AauIVhw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-02-14", "type": "review"}
