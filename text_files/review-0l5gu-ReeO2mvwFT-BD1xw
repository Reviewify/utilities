It wasn't until recently that I started to revisit them, I had forgotten how good the food is. Nothing on the menu really stands out, but it's more interesting then your average burger joint. They've got a pretty good breakfast too, it's worth getting up early for on the weekends anyway. The wait staff is typical of Blacksburg. On my last visit, I ordered one thing and received another. I didn't raise a fuss, the food was good anyway, and I got to try something I normally wouldn't have ordered.", "business_id": "5zyibT__dkE21sAyLb1qvA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-03", "type": "review"}
