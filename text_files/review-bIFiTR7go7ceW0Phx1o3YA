Their veggie burger is so. freaking. good. I think I'm becoming addicted. When you hear about a chick at Betty Ford for veggie burger addiction on the news- this girl right here. It's greasy and tasty and delicious...and now I want one. And it's only 9:45 a.m. Crap.  Their fries are decent, not the best I've had but the texture and crispiness is usually pretty good. Their soda machine always tastes a little off (but don't all restaurants?), but they also serve Cokes in those old-fashioned bottles.  The staff is friendly and they seem to do a pretty good job at handling the lunchtime rush. They've also never messed up anything on any of my orders- and I'm one of those annoying people that customize everything- so props to them for that.  Yum!", "business_id": "jopjqDfrNnCX4nj_pE-rTg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-23", "type": "review"}
