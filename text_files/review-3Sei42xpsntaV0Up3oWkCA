It was the bride's birthday weekend so we wanted to have a cake at dinner. The restaurant does not make cakes, but they did allow us to bring one in. They sliced and served the cake at no charge, which to me shows they go the extra mile for their customers. \nOur watress was fantastic and fulfilled many special requests without  hesitation. I wish I had remembered her name to notify the manager what a great job she did. \nThe goat cheese balls were amazing! I love goat cheese, so deep frying it and serving it with honey can only make it better in my opinion. \nFor my entree I ordered the lamb. It lacked flavor, but was cooked very well. I don't think I would order it again if I were to return to Ecco, as the pastas and pizzas looked amazing!\n\nAll in all, I was very satisfied with the experience and would recommend Ecco without hesitation for any group function!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rP90TP7gOMzBFTrKWEEsOw"}
