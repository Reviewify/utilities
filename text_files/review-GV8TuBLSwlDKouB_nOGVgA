This place is HORRENDOUS. I love vegetarian food and can be frequently found at Falafel Palace, Life Alive, and The Otherside. But, if not for obvious signs like cutlery and a menu, I would not have even categorized Veggie Galaxy's offerings as food. I had the \"Reuben.\" The marble rye was good and so was the swiss cheese, but the tofu was \"smoked\" aka covered in LIGHTER FLUID. It tasted positively toxic. My friend got the chickpea and mushroom burger and I sampled it. The after taste was rancid and the texture left much to be desired. The other in my party said their black bean burger was \"decent\" aside from removing all of the tempeh bacon, which kind of defeats the purpose of ordering it, eh? Good luck with this place. I'd stick to french fries and omelettes if I were you. Or, a better idea, check out some of the positively delectable eateries in Central Square and sacrifice enjoying the kitschy atmosphere for the ten minutes before your gross food arrives.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qw5gR8vW7mSOK4VROSwdMA"}
