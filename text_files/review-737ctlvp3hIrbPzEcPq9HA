Going in with the idea \"these barbers know there stuff\" is a farce. I assume there's a good cut to be had somewhere in that shop, but I sure didn't find it.  The \"$10 Buzz Cut\" seems like a great deal, until you realize you don't even get $10 worth of quality.  Spend the extra $10 ($20 total) and get your fade at one of the higher end shops... or don't.", "business_id": "E1_svh9AzG6IbDw7_Y4sKw", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-08", "type": "review"}
