After seeing so many good reviews about the cedar plank salmon, I had high expectations, even though I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon either. Whatever taste of the cedar plank there was supposed to be, I felt like it was completely covered by the awkward black bean salsa that really added nothing to the dish. And the real deal breaker was that my salmon was beyond tender- the entire underside was pretty much raw. I like raw salmon as much as the next guy, but somehow I don't think that's what they meant to do.  I don't think anyone else at the table was blown away either. The seafood enchiladas and pecan crusted chicken were both mediocre. And my friend's Texas T-Bone came out nearing well done, when she ordered medium rare. (Although I think she's used to it by now, because everyone always messes up her steak orders.) The restaurant was very accommodating though. I called maybe 30-45 minutes before we were going to see if we could make a reservation. They said that they'd figure it out and told us to just show up. Thanks for not making us wait! We didn't get a bread basket though, which of course, is really disappointing for me since I love bread... we only got two options- a sourdough and a sourdough with rosemary baked in.", "business_id": "JyOh6zIV1sGINuEnzOBckw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-06-04", "type": "review"}
