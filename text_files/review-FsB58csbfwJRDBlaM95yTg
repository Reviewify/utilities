A mobile cupcake truck that also accepts Credit Cards?! What is this amazing thing?! When Marc A. informed me that the next stop would be at a cupcake truck, I was most ecstatic. Kate who owns this little truck was the sweetest ever, she gave me smiles and I gave her giggles, I mean..what's there not to giggle about? I picked out a Smores and a Lemon Raspberry cupcake, but then noticed that the box was too big for 2 cupcakes and the only way the cupcakes wouldn't get smoshed, would be to get a 3rd cupcake. Yes, that's my excuse to get a 3rd cupcake. And I picked out a Red Velvet and she tucked it into the box for me. Smores was absolutely fantastic, chocolate cake, with marshmallow torched frosting, and graham crackers. I had frosting all over my face after I was done with this one. Yes, come to the CupKates cart, pick out a cupcake, and leave thinking about rainbows and butterflies.", "business_id": "zqvFNZq8q86V7QOcpURcSg", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-11-17", "type": "review"}
