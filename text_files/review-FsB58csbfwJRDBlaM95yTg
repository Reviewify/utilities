Yes, that's my excuse to get a 3rd cupcake.  And I picked out a Red Velvet and she tucked it into the box for me.  \n\nSmores was absolutely fantastic, chocolate cake, with marshmallow torched frosting, and graham crackers.  I had frosting all over my face after I was done with this one.\n\nYes, come to the CupKates cart, pick out a cupcake, and leave thinking about rainbows and butterflies.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zqvFNZq8q86V7QOcpURcSg"}
