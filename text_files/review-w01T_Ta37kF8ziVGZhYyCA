We were on our way to Newbury, and the decor simply drew us in. The cupcakes? Best I've had, hands down. The lemon and Boston cream are my favorite - the right balance between soft and firm, and the frosting is never sickly sweet, but flavored just right. Grab a seat by the window and watch people and traffic flow by while enjoying a lovely cupcake and the sounds of soothing French music crooning in the background :D", "business_id": "eZ6dhl4xB9xJOzfB62ChKw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-09-19", "type": "review"}
