My husband and I went for dinner a few nights ago, and it was extremely disappointing. First off, the appetizer was burnt, really burnt. The cooks tried to flip it over, so the burnt part was upside down, but it's hard not to notice that your food is CHARRED. The entree was ok, I had the chicken Saltimboca, it was served on top of bone dry spaghetti. No sauce, not even any butter. So I asked our waiter if I could get a side of tomato sauce or something for the pasta, and he asked if I would like the Saltimboca sauce...ummm...I ORDERED the Saltimboca...shouldn't the sauce be on my plate already????????? Uugh. The store bought chocolate cake was a good dessert choice, but it was halfway off the plate when they brought it out, the whipped cream from the top fell off and onto the table when the waiter put it down. Yum. Beyond all that, our drinks were never refilled, even after we asked for them to be, the bread dish, salad plates and appetizer plates were never removed from the table, so they were all piling up in front of us. It was just BAD. If you're in Amherst looking for good food go to Judy's. If you're in the mood for fast food Italian, go to the Olive Garden. I can't say much about Bertucci's as a chain, but steer clear of this one.", "business_id": "RPKnhndXvWHukeZ2e8stYQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-07-11", "type": "review"}
