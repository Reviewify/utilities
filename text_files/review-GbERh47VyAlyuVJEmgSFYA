That was me- I stuck w/ my waxer for the last several years even though I wasn't really happy w/ her anymore. When she moved her business out of the city, I was excited to try a new place to get all my waxing needs done- I did a lot of research, and this place appealed to me the most.\n\nThe girl at the front desk was really nice, I checked in and Ashley took me right back to the room.  The place is really clean, modern and has lots of pink- really cute!  Ashley did a great job on everything- my brows looked great, and the brazilian was done extremely quick and reletively painless.  I was totally impressed! I'm really glad that I gave them a try and look forward to using them as my primary waxing place in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YuFgYxnlQCziua5geeVRXw"}
