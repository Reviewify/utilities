I tried the cookie dough specialty roll and man was it delicious! After I tried it I just kept craving it day after day until I dragged my friend back there with me to get another one. The rolls are really moist and soft and the frosting isn't too heavy, though it is really sweet. Only downside? $5 for specialty rolls. A bit pricey for the average poor college student :(", "business_id": "2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-27", "type": "review"}
