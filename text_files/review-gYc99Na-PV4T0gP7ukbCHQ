We're were very pleased and enjoyed our dinner. They weren't very busy. It was very relaxed. The service was very good and quick. My wife got the combination dinner (2 enchiladas - one chicken, and one potato - with rice). I ordered the Cancun Burrito (shrimp and scallops). It was great, although next time I may substitute black beans for the refried beans and ask for salsa on top in stead of the cheese sauce. However, it was very tasty as it was, and I had no problems finishing it all. The free chips and salsa were also good. We definitely plan on going back here and highly recommend it.", "business_id": "wxckIcRTURJPiHHAFrHg5w", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-03", "type": "review"}
