I'm sorry, but the cookies are hard and flavorless. I was hoping for a little bit softer and tastier cookie and so was everyone in my group(4 people). I wouldn't drive all the way to the Westside just because they are $1.50 when I could buy a pint of my fave ice cream and a bag of Peppridge farm cookies and make a better ice cream sandwich at home. If you are in the area, try it. If you have to drive more than 10 minutes, pass. CASH ONLY.
