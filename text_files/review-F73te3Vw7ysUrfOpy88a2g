My wife and I love Indian food, especially when places have goat and lamb, instead of just chicken and vegetarian dishes - and Sharma's has both goat and lamb, usually even on the buffet. Lots of places serve goat from the regular menu, but not usually on the buffet - but Sharma's does! Also included in the buffet are seared chicken kabobs they bring to the table sizzling. Very nice touch. The naan is good, no matter what kind you get. We're suckers for plain, naan-flavored naan. The garlic is good, too. Service is always outstanding, too. Basically... if you want Indian, go here or Taj Mahal. :)", "business_id": "dHgwhkMVKezTII0Hkz8TAg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-07-21", "type": "review"}
