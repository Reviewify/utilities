I'm from California and thus I am comparing Yami Yami to the numerous bubble tea/boba places in California. B. I only tried their bubble tea. That being said....after being in DC for 7 weeks and having crazy cravings for California food...and hearing a friend of mine who goes to UMD saying there was bubble tea, I was definitely going to try it out. So the tea is decent. It definitely reminds me and tastes like the bubble tea you can find at your typical California bubble tea places. Prices, however, are expensive (at least for my standards). More than $3.50 for a small cup is a bit pricey from where I'm from - however it satisfied my cravings very well and I'd still come here to fill my cravings (and maybe eat some sushi too)", "business_id": "XPRLOKOWaisJo5aS_AV3Zw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-03", "type": "review"}
