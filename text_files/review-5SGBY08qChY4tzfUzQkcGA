(yes i'm a nerd) i like tealuxe because it's a tea place, and i like tea. tea seems to take the backseat to coffee shops, and i like how teas are the center of attention here. kinda like teavana. however, the fact that it's sort of a franchise lessens its value to me. kind of like how starbucks has gotten all global. the more of it i see, the less special it is. however, tealuxe has a cute ambience inside. it wasn't one of those places where i found a tea that i *really* liked and had to come back for more... but i do remember not liking the concoction of tea and hot chocolate... i believe it was a mixture of hot chocolate and earl grey tea. it just didn't mix well.", "business_id": "RDzV57rWFU0eXPeqTCl7UA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-27", "type": "review"}
