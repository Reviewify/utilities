I'll round up because I like tea, and that's what you do when the next digit is greater than 5. (yes I'm a nerd)\n\nI like Tealuxe because it's a tea place, and I like tea. Tea seems to take the backseat to coffee shops, and I like how teas are the center of attention here. Kinda like Teavana.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's sort of a franchise lessens its value to me. Kind of like how Starbucks has gotten all global. The more of it I see, the less special it is. However, Tealuxe has a cute ambience inside.\n\nIt wasn't one of those places where I found a tea that I *really* liked and had to come back for more... but I do remember not liking the concoction of tea and hot chocolate... I believe it was a mixture of hot chocolate and earl grey tea. It just didn't mix well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RDzV57rWFU0eXPeqTCl7UA"}
