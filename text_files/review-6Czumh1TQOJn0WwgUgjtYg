Free salad and pasta is a nice small snack after a ~3 mile run. I'm only on my 4th check in as I started a few months ago and am busy with school and work. I'm trying to attend as many Tuesdays as possible so I can get to my 10th run and get a FREE Technical T. \n\nWonderful way to promote good health and exercise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5uZThcFfaadyiA-nXpto1Q"}
