I walked in with my bike and said I needed a tube. Without asking or discussion the guy starts to put on the new tube. I being a bit frazzled from walking around in the heat assumed that the 2 minutes labor it takes to put on a tube would be complimentary like MOST shops I've been to. MAYBE a couple bucks at most. He then gives me the total, $15. I expressed that that was pretty expensive for a tube and he gave me that old, \"it's the economy\" line without mentioning what the real cost was. I checked my receipt only to discover that I was charged $8 labor for a $7 tube that took a couple minutes to put on and that I could have done myself in the parking lot. I asked for a refund and was refused.\n\nI can't stand bike shops that gouge people on labor prices. I understand they have to make a living but so do I and I know what's fair and what's a racket. Some shops like BLUE LINE actually care about the common cyclist.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5trbzFHsZObo5hWn03YQlg"}
