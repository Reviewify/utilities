OK here goes:\n\nWhen there's two bucks in your wallet and you need pizza in your gullet, don't think twice about it -- just go to HI-FI\n\n... That's about as far as I got, and it doesn't even rhyme really so it's a crappy jingle, but I think it covers the necessities here. Of all the drunk-stumble holes in the wall I've been to, this one's probably the fastest and least bad. And when you've blown all your cash on imbiberies, HI-FI comes through with a pizza slice for $1.90--and god bless 'em for it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ICoLhQP3bryEmiYeUNu51g"}
