Detailed information on each vinyl sleeve. Yes, pretty much every record is sleeved, which shows the care and attention to detail that this shop shows. And not only are they sleeved, cleaned, and demoed, there is also information on the front as to its pressing history and condition...oh, I already said that. Guess what, that's something almost no other vinyl store even cares to do! I picked up a couple jazz and blues records here that I probably couldn't have found anywhere else in good condition. I give Neptune my full endorsement. Better yet, have an ultra-nerdy day descending into this labyrinth of wax and then after resurfacing go to the comic shop around the corner or Twice Sold Tales across 45th.", "business_id": "qrG5VQQofbnEiePUGlJHlA", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-04-14", "type": "review"}
