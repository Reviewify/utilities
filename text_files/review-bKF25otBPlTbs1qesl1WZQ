Sprinkles, a very popular and highly anticipated franchise, finally opened in the Stanford Mall, and business is very busy. It is so busy that there is a long wait outside of the store. I haven't decided if it is because of the name alone, or because of the quality of cupcakes. They have all the standard flavors typical of cupcakes plus a few exotic ones. Be forewarned, only certain flavors are available on certain days of the week or certain seasons. The cupcakes look very pretty and will catch the eyes of almost any cupcake lover. My gf is quite the cupcake connoisseur, and you can see her imagine frolicking in the fields holding hands with all the yummy cupcakes. The cupcakes are average sized; the cake is very oily; the frosting is layered on the top of each cupcake, and includes a decorative sugar button. The only thing that makes this cupcake good is the frosting. It has a perfect blend of sugar and butter. Once you have a Sprinkles, it will be an instant favorite, but don't end your search there for that perfect cupcake.
