Simple menu with fresh ingredients and cooking methods and premium toppings and menu items. I love avocados so I ordered the Big Papi burger and made it a combo. The burger was full of flavor and the ingredients tasted fresh and the fries were well seasoned. Definitely worth a quick visit when in Boston.", "business_id": "PPQgcw0WKdZ6nznkPLgX5Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-18", "type": "review"}
