You can get it all over the place; why did it have to come to the Stanford student center food court and push out the previous Chinese place, which at least was different and not Panda Express all the bloody time, and had really good salt-and-pepper chicken wings? I've only eaten here a couple of times, but I have to report that one lunchtime recently was the only time I've ever had really bad service at a Panda Express.  The server taking my order was just utterly clueless and had no idea what I wanted, either when I said it or pointed to it, and mostly stood there looking dim.  I gave up and walked out, had a teriyaki bowl at the Treehouse instead.  Much better, and not the exact same thing I can get in a million other places.", "business_id": "vcK6oZ2tAniie5Zt3ympXQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-04-28", "type": "review"}
