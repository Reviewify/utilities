This place gets so many high fives.  (quick note - I haven't had any work done yet! but I am very tempted...) I took two of my very dear friends in for procedures. The doctor was professional, excellent bed-side manner, and the results are amazing. They were gorgeous before but now they are knockouts. Definitely worth the money. The rest of the staff is super sweet...the receptionist, the nurse. This place takes care of it's patients. They don't just shove you out the door when you are done. They make sure that you understand everything, send you home with essentials, call you to make sure everything is ok...and are very welcoming/receptive to follow up calls/questions you have. They go above and beyond....I wish more places and people were like this. Tips: They have some great specials that they run from time to time. This place is in La Jolla.
