I stopped by with a study buddy to catch up some studying while eating some food (BTW I am NOT a UCLA student! Don't ask why a Trojan is doing on the wrong side of town, but I have to make due with the eateries around!) So the place has a pretty good ambiance to it, definitely nothing romantic or anything, but fairly comfortable for a deli-restaurant. Plus points for the free wi-fi! My friend (a Bruin who I get along surprisingly well with) had been here numerous times so she recommended the pesto cavatappi ($7) and the chicken pomodori panini ($7) to split. I was warned that some selections in the place were bad, and I decided I didn't want to find out for myself. Anyways our orders were pretty good, and the price was very very affordable, especially for a poor starving student. The staff was also really friendly and helpful. After we finished our meals and were studying for a bit, our waiter came by with free complimentary baked goods for us to try. For the food I did try and my initial impressions I think this place is great in terms of ambiance and slightly above average in terms of food. Overall: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4", "business_id": "qMZj6xcCvyqPef_xqxBEsw", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-04-19", "type": "review"}
