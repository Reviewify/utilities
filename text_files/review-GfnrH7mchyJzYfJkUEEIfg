The cashier stated I could order from the bar and pay the bartender but I could not pay her and order them from her???. Fine, I could order a drink and wait. Sat at the bar for 15 minutes and moved to different spots at the bar to get their attention. After watching the bartenders chat it up with friends I left and went to another restaurant. I could not for the life of me get their attention and they could care less.", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-07-24", "type": "review"}
