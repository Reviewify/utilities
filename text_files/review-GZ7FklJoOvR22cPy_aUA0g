Eggs benedict, stuffed french toast... I have never had anything bad! Dinner is good too, though. Meatloaf, hamburgers, sandwiches, and mac and cheese are all yummy here. One thing I love about this place is that they are very dog-friendly (sit outside and tie up your dog next to your table) and it is great for kids. Service tends to be pretty slow. Especially frustrating if you come for happy hour and want to get your drink order in before it ends!", "type": "review", "business_id": "U7UVERrPVvLJ8HN6TI92DQ"}
