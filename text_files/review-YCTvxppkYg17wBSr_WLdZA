On a design level...it's definitely above average for Atlanta. As far as the food; it's good, but it's expensive for what it is. I think Geisha House's strongest suite is the upstairs area, which looks down on the restaurant, as it's really a great chill spot for drinks. It's designed better than most lounges in the city and has plenty of seating. I do feel for the male wait staff as their uniforms are really bad and unflattering. They got the design of everything else right, but forgot about the uniforms apparently. Being that it's also at Atlantic Station, you got to avoid it on the weekends.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dchpdGlWTlC2w_zEOV0KYg"}
