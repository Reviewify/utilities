Rob cuts my hair, and I'm usually very satisfied with his cuts -- they always seem old-fashioned at first, when he's cutting it, but I've never had a haircut that grows in as well as from Rob.  The problem is I have a crazy cowlick on the top of my head, the likes of which Rob refers to as \"the most extreme cowlick I've ever encountered in my 20 years of cutting hair, and believe me, I've seen a LOT of Asian heads in that time\".  Thanks Rob.  It's good to know I will always have something extreme about me, even when i'm 90.\n\nEdit:  After 2 years of having Rob cut my hair, I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars... Rob pretty much knows exactly what I want, and all the random aspects of my hair, and does a fantastic job cutting my hair every time... I used to get my hair cut every 4 weeks, because I couldn't stand the way it looked after about a month, but now, i wait about 6 weeks because it always grow in very nicely and still looks fine for a long time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KHTUSC5dE2VvrTA5na1XJw"}
