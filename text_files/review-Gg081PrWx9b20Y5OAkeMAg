I've observed a great deal of attitude by the servers who get very frustrated when new people don't know what the options are. Yes, we know that you guys are in a hurry, but isn't about quality over how fast it's being done? They're fast at what they do, but there's no sincerity with assistance at all.\nSecond, what's with the portion size? I've had bigger bowls back home with the choices I wanted, not just because I didn't put more stuff into it.\nAlso, this goes for not only this Chipotle, but Chipotle's in general: the prices keep moving up, and the food pales in quality to real, authentic Mexican restaurants which is a lot less cheaper.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tzRNk1hqooBV3i-Q_yKP7g"}
