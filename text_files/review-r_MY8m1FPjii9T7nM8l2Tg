The cheese has a nice sharpness and deep flavor. The sauce is perfectly tangy without being sweet, and surprisingly tastes like real tomatoes. The crust is crisp and has a bit of a salty bite to it. These three factors contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable pizza-eating experience.\n\nNon-plain slices vary. The Spinach, Tomato, and Ricotta white slices are absolutely wonderful. Their spinach actually has flavor, the tomatoes are fresh, and the creamy ricotta compliments the tangy crust and salty cheese excellently. Their topped slices and pies actually have plenty of toppings, unlike some other pizza joints in Oakland (cough Pizza Sola cough). Mushrooms taste canned, which is not very pleasant.. Pepperoni is average, I prefer Sola's. \n\nOther menu items again vary. Hoagies are average, there are better places in Oakland for that.  Calzones are based on the same great crust so they're pretty solid.\n\nGood, quick, and friendly service for the most part. My major qualm is that it closes pretty early and that it isn't open on weekends.\n\nOverall, easily the best spot in Oakland to grab a plain or spinach slice. Forget the competition, Milano's is king.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0fkjHTNaMCT4FjZqaa4euA"}
