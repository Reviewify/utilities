She's now at BRIO spa & salon 888 Morada place, Altadena, CA 91001 (626) 296-9044 \n\nThe Massage Company is just a great as the hosh posh spas in Beverly Hills-- it's even better actually-- it's a 3 minute drive and I receive the same quality service!\n\n$39 for 1 hr Swedish massage \nParking Lot\n\nI would highly recommend Joia.  She's awesome...her suite has a relaxing ambiance- candles, sweet music, dim lighting.  Her hands are gifted!!  She has awesome pressure but if that's not your preference just let her know and she'll take note!\n\nThere are rarely last minute appointments available with her because EVERYONE requests her.  So make an appointment and ask for Joia-- promise you WONT regret it.  Matter of fact, you'll owe me one.  ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "GNkw9Gu9Ing5XVCcKfd6Ag"}
