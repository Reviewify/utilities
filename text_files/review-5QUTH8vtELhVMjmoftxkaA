(2) incorporate the delicious coleslaw (+sauce) into the sandwich. these are necessary components. also, you don't want to have to explain what \"memphis\" means to every single customer, do you? also, include it in the price. the sandwich was yummy, but probably not worth $8.50+tax. make it $7.50 (w/ coleslaw + sauce fo free) besides those two suggestions, i'm super happy that this place opened up just around the corner from my work. love love love pulled pork (since i started eating it again - \"pork is the new vegan,\" riiiiight?!). how ironic is it that cinnaholic (the vegan cinnamon roll shop) is next door to a bbq joint? overall, the store is coming together but still has a lot of work to do. good luck guys :)", "business_id": "YDOKZjBzxY6cJL1YUoDYSA", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-08-10", "type": "review"}
