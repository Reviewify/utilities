My girlfriend's mother lives in Ohio and is absolutely obsessed with New Delhi and for the life of me I can't figure out why lol. It has a decent buffet that fits the needs of the masses.  The spice is a little bland which suits the masses and even dishes ordered \"very spice\" or \"Indian spicy\" really aren't spicy at all. In fairness I did live in London for about a year and half and would challenge legit Indian restaurants (my flatmate was Indian, yes really from India and I have yet to taste anything remotely rivaling her homemade curry and naan) to give me all the spicey they had :-D.  New Delhi does have a liquor license so you can order beer or wine but there beer selection is really lacking. They only had one mediocre Indian beer in stock last time I was there. For me a first rate IPA is a necessary companion to a spicy and delicious meal which is why I tend to prefer BYOB's. Ice cream is included with the buffet which is really nice and tasty (highly recommend their mango ice cream). All and all it's a good spot that will please most.", "business_id": "YN4Kk751tmdvoarGo8z7_A", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-11-22", "type": "review"}
