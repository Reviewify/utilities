It was a bit confusing trying to find out which door to go through, then i didnt know if i was to go upstairs or downstairs.. so they should really work on that.      It's a nice romantic place. The prices are up there but with restaurant week..you cant go wrong    Staff was friendly and there was a young lady who came by with a basket full of bread and she came often :)        I had the bluefish pate to start ..which was ok...it was good but had a fishy aftertaste i did not care for.  My mom had the mixed greens with a raspberry dijon sauce which was good.   All the dishes came with your choice of either pommes frites, rice pilaf, sweet or regular potatoes or dill potatoes. I had the chicken with fries and my mom had the salmon. I have to say both dishes were excellent. The chicken was cooked just right and the dijon cream sauce was yummy.    I sampled the salmon and it was soft, not overcooked and delish!  Another surprisingly good thing about the dish were the veggies. I was a good girl and finished them all :)   Dessert we both got the Crepes with fruit inside with a sweet cream..Meh! i could do without but im glad i tried it. My mother wasnt a fan either!  I always ask myself afte a dining experience \"Will you come back?\"  Answer: Possiblly but i want to try Chez Pascal...  I would recommend that you try it and see for yourself :)", "business_id": "wfS1G5lrjx_SGWBuG2690g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-07-29", "type": "review"}
