Really, most of the time, it should be a 3, only I never go there before 2AM. And after 2AM, usually after leaving 1020, it becomes a magical place for drunk munchies. There's something about overly buttery Roti mixed with lots of hot sauce and potatoes that makes the morning indigestion worth it. They keep late hours on weekend nights for bar hoppers, which is a plus, but I'd hardly recommend it for lunch. It build a strong following, though, evidenced by a buddy who through a trash can at the metal gate outside one night when they had closed early.\nI'd stick to the vegetarian dishes, and it's a great alternative to Koronets(probably just as bad for you, though).", "type": "review", "business_id": "Y2I946V78wOdwaUD9chmqg"}
