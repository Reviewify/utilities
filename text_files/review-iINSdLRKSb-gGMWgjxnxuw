Just because someone happened to have the good luck to be Google's first chef doesn't make them a great restaurateur. The owner's claim to fame, which is repeated endlessly, is that he was Google's first chef. Two words: Big. Deal.\n\nWe went there for brunch, and the main point I want to make is about the coffee. I shall make this point with a little metaphorical story.\n\nImagine a man has the winning ticket to the $30 million lottery jackpot. He has ten minutes left to get to the Lottery office to claim his prize before the deadline. Rain is pouring. Traffic is bad. And he is so severely delayed, that when he arrives at the office, 5 minutes late, the officials solemnly tell him that he will not be awarded the prize.\n\nTake that level of bitterness. Double it. Voila - - you have have equaled the taste of Calafia's coffee.\n\nAs for the food, it isn't anything better than you would get at Hobee's (although you get to pay more for it.........oh, and the owner was Google's first chef).\n\nSuffice it to say, I won't be going back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Nzn4B6Y-Rj2QOhSe7UTMzw"}
