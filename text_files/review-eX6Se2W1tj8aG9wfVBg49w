It's not a relaxing atmosphere at all.  Even while you're clearly eating/finishing your drink you feel like everyone wants you to leave and free up your seat. It's also a little pricey and they have a card minimum which is irritating.  I think it's something like $10 but I'm not positive. I primarily go here if I'm getting something to go.  It's just not an enjoyable place to eat your sandwich or cookie.  The food is very good, you want to be able to enjoy it and not feel the pressure to eat quickly because the cafe is busy.  Also I feel like the layout of the cafe is a bit off.  There's no clear place to wait to pick up your drink that's not blocking the walkway.  Also, for such a busy place I feel like they should use names for drinks more often.  They'll use your name for sandwiches but not so much for drinks.  But the espresso is really, really good.", "business_id": "PFppNi9rZWAw5f8e5J41MQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-01", "type": "review"}
