My friend took me here to get some angus beef burgers, and I wasn't dissapointed .. The deco was really wild and crazy; I loved it. Me being this shy asian girl, I was a little intimidated by the waitresses and customers (a lot of bikers (oh bikers..) ^^) Anyway the burger was so delicious .. not greasy, but juicy .. ingredients were fresh, and what can I say about the fried zucchini ... sigh. I miss eating here.", "business_id": "Z2qMwUhnGt_2pA9uQbS7Uw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-01-15", "type": "review"}
