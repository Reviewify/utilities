These are burgers.\nMy friend took me here to get some angus beef burgers, and\nI wasn't dissapointed .. The deco was really wild and crazy;\nI loved it. Me being this shy asian girl, I was a little\nintimidated by the waitresses and customers (a lot of bikers (oh\nbikers..) ^^) Anyway the burger was so delicious .. not greasy,\nbut juicy .. ingredients were fresh, and what can I say\nabout the fried zucchini ... sigh.
