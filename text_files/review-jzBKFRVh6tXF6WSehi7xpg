My first surprise was that the beer selection was much better than I anticipated. When I have a choice between multiple German beers, and good German beers, its a good day. I ended up getting a special German wheat beer, which wasn't bad. But next time I\"ll get the Franziskaner. So so good. I ordered a double silver dollar burger with herbed cheese and a garden salad. The garden salad I had had fresh greens and tomatoes as well as some cucumber. But there weren't many vegetables. However, the vinaigrette was tangy and tasty.As the name entails they were a little over the size of a silver dollar. The cheese on them was really tasty. The lettuce and tomato were ok, nothing special.  My fries were good, but not overly noteworthy.   All in all it was a nice place to chill and wait for the train. Its a good thing I took the train back home, other wise I would have gotten pulled over. Next time, make it Franziskaner time!", "business_id": "4RMHlggaIdNibPUJPVEd6w", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-08-13", "type": "review"}
