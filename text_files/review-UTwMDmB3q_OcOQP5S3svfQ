I bought my daughter her first piece of Tiffanny jewelry, so i was suuuuper excited. They didn't have the piece I was seeking onsite, so they ordered it for me from California.  The manager was training the sales person at the time so it did take a big longer, but I didn't mind because the situation was handled very professionally.  The only downside is that I wish they hadn't charged me for shipping. I did come in to the store to order it, after all.  BUT, the package arrived well before the expected date, so that made up for it in the long run. SHE LOVES IT!", "business_id": "2CAmCL0UmJaDQbCFKHwUtQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-12-29", "type": "review"}
