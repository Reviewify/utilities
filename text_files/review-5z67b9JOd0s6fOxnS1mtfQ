The worst thing of it all is that they didn't have angus burgers, so I had to get a bison burger with their 'William's sauce' which is pretty much BBQ sauce. The burger was big, filling, and good but blandly plated. Their soda's were about $3 and didn't have free refills. They also had an extensive wine list with the most expensive being $80. While the most expensive thing on the menu was a $30 steak, most everything else stayed in the $8-$15 range. My friends got BLT's which were good but came in a portion that left them wanting more, and the fries that came with most meals were above the grade of other restaurants of the like. The waiter we got was pretty good but we also had a lot of weird people who worked there show up at the table offering us food and items we didn't order. I would go back in a couple of months to see if it has improved but I wouldn't recommend it as it is now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "VQhlN0DJTffpUOw6j82oVw"}
