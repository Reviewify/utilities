(see. this is why we're fat.) when she brought it to my table (when did they start doing that?!?!), my first thought was \"is that a chicken drumette? are you kidding me?\" but i was calm, cool about it. i hadn't touched anything. and when she passed my way again, i just calmly said \"is there a way to exchange this for a quarter dark with a better drumstick? i have been looking forward to having the drumstick all to myself.\" even her jaw dropped when she actually looked at the drumstick that was on my plate. she said let me take a look and see what i can do. boom. a few minutes later, she returned with a nice, full-sized drumstick. juicy and ready for me to bite. mmmm. mmmmm. mmmm. add in the mashed potatoes, the macaroni 'n' cheese, and the lemon garlic spinach (when did they start making that?!?!) and wash it all down with some high fructose corn syrup sweetened iced tea and i'm good. i'm a fan.", "business_id": "ysOvVK6jj5xTbVJDNf_RsA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-10-28", "type": "review"}
