Part of the reason why I support them, The more form-fitting dresses are cut perfectly for a woman's figure and have an amazing fit. They always make me (and my friends who borrow them) feel like I have a bangin' body even on those days when I think I don't. It's like wearing built-in Spanx. Always a wide variety of styles and colors, for hipsters and non-hipsters alike.\n\nThis store is tiny, with not much of the merchandise you see in other stores. Parking is in Westwood Village, therefore it's shit. I always come here during the day and the fitting room is inconveniently located upstairs. No one monitors it, so you have to find a staff member (they're always gathered at the checkout talking, never walking around the store if you need help) to open it for you, and wait till they finish helping whoever they're ringing it up. A little hard to dash in and out on a lunch break.\n\nMy worst beef with this store is NO REFUNDS! Come on, what year is this? Is this a swap meet? They only give store credit, even if your clothes are brand new, tags on, receipt, in the bag, etc. Definitely something that will discourage me from shopping there. And you can't use the store credit online. \n\nWhy do you have to sell such well-cut clothes, that are so annoying to buy? Why?", "type": "review", "business_id": "4GuSZLvZhLx3HXVr1F1tLA"}
