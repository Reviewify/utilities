There was no detail on my dress - it was just plain silk taffeta - but they still charged $140 to steam it. Air and water. $140. \n\nAnyway. I paid them. Told them I needed my dress by Thursday, Friday at the latest - seeing as I was getting married on Saturday.\n\nThey told me I \"might\" have it by Friday.\n\nAnyway. I dropped off my dress along with my cathedral length veil to be steamed (in addition to my custom hangar a friend made for me that had my married name on it). \n\nThursday comes. No dress.\n\nFriday morning, the day before the wedding, they tell me my dress is ready.\n\nI walk in to pick it up and the lady hands me the dress from behind the counter - and it is IN A BOX.\n\nThey did not press it. They did not steam it.\n\nTHEY PRESERVED it. That's what you do AFTER a wedding. \n\nThe dress was FOLDED and PRESERVED in a box - not to mention my veil was CRUMPLED in a ball underneath my dress in the box.\n\nAnd my custom hangar? Gone. When I asked where it was (through my tears at this point) they said they threw it away.\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?! \n\nThey asked me why I couldn't wear it. \n\nI don't know, because it's FOLDED IN A BOX. Not pressed, wrinkle free, and on my nice hangar along with my veil.\n\nAnyway, LONG story short - they did, eventually send it back and press it correctly that same day. But I didn't have my dress until JUST before the rehearsal that evening - they did find my hangar in the trash... but did NOTHING to remedy the situation.\n\nLook, I paid $140 to have my dress and veil looking nice, NOT $140 to have it put in a box and give me a coronary the day before my wedding.\n\nI am a super laid back, easy-going, and understanding person, but this really sent me over the edge. \n\nI still can't believe they wouldn't even give me any type of credit, refund, or ANYTHING. \n\nI will NEVER in my life, EVER, EVER take an item of clothing to Deluxe Cleaners.\n\nIn fact, I will make it my mission to tell everyone to take their clothing elsewhere.\n\n/rant", "type": "review", "business_id": "2FTmc5LabeAan7eFZtB25A"}
