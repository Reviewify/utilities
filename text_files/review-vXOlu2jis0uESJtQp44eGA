Its also home of the story that I call \"the most expensive pizza I've ever bought\". \nI ended up here shortly before valentines day while waiting for a pizza to be ready. I decided to poke my head in for some nostalgia (this passed summer I went to switzerland for a trip). After a conversation with a new employee I walked out with a Mondaine watch (the watch face looks like the clocks the swiss railway uses) as a gift for my valentine. \nThey were wililng to put a metal band on the watch, subtracting the cost of the leather band I didn't want from the cost of the metal one. The next day, my valentine brought the watch in (she loved it by the way) and we got the band sized perfectly for her. \nWatches here are hardly ever on sale (if ever) tend to be pricey, but they have a huge selection of great watches and can stand behind there products. \nAs a warning, everything here takes time. So, try to ignore than thousands of second hands ticking by, because nothing happens here fast. They just want to make sure they understand you and vice versa before they do anything. \nIts kind of sweet.", "type": "review", "business_id": "wan1X8JMyIylyQ4Z7yOFdg"}
