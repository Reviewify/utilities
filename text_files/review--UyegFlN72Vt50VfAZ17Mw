The hostess was very nice and our party was seated right on time. Our drinks from the bar came out within 10 minutes of being seated. Yarra was our server and she made sure the party enjoyed the dinner. She brought us a round of shots on the house. The food was very good and the drinks were excellent. I will be back soon. Yelpers this is a great place to host a party! The fall weather goes great with the outside seating.", "business_id": "oOjuZqUGe_JZLrO0b4XTpA", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}
