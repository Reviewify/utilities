A broth so below mediocre, that no amount of hoisin sauce and hot sauce can raise it even the slightest. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a go for the sole purpose of getting this dish on a cold, cloudy afternoon. Were we disappointed? Sadly so. But to my surprise, I found toasted garlic chips in the broth. Sad that you tasted it after most of the consumption was made, but you did get it none the less.\n\nThis joint doesn't stick out the slightest, besides the obvious asian critters seeping everywhere here. I will come back to try other items on their menu. Clearly, pho is not the way to go here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA"}
