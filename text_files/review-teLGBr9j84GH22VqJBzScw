We had great service and the food is super fresh, using local ingredients.  We tried all kinds of things!  But it was off the summer menu so I'm not sure it will be there for long.  The grilled chicken with Mexican succotash and grits on the side was delicious.  Also the gumbo is great (smoky flavor) and the golden beet salad was the best I've had.  My friend got the burger.  The bread was like a French bread rather than the trendy brioche bun, but it was still a well-seasoned burger.  All that + a charcuterie plate + 2 glasses of wine each..we were pleased!    \n\nCouple of logistics: There is no valet or parking lot so allow some time to find a street space.  Also, make sure to reserve early so you can get a nice table (courtyard is ideal).", "type": "review", "business_id": "hmhaC0cPIpIZMFkOzWkOsQ"}
