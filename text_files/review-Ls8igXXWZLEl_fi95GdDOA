I was very disappointed when I opened my order to find that they separate the teriyaki sauce from the chicken and salmon. I understand their concept, that is if they were trying to do this; to we as customers have control over how much sauce should be drizzled on the chicken and salmon order. But the taste after you apply the teriyaki sauce isn't the same kind of effect if they were just already prepare it that way. I enjoyed slurping on the miso soup, their salad is okay the salad dressing is unique - tasted like peanut with a mix of seasame oil. For almost $15 I paid for lunch - it is not worth going back here.", "business_id": "JnLNfQtW9GLGRF1pzAd55w", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-11-08", "type": "review"}
