We headed out to the Art Authority for a couple drinks and to hear dj's...turns out they had a lot more going on.  Funky old movies were projected on the walls while everybody danced--so much fun.  Out back the big patio area had seating around a fire pit for us pyros.   They even had a guy grilling veggies out there.  The patio was open to SpiderHouse, so we were able to hear a couple live bands, too.  The cigarette girls roaming with selections of smokes and individual-sized champagne bottles were adorable.  Met some cool people that night; glad we checked it out.", "business_id": "7Dzq6BqOdC0AzecREP2LCA", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-01-15", "type": "review"}
