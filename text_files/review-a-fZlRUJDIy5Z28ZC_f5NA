My wife took her very expensive suit jacket here, and asked the owner to sew the button on better before dry cleaning it, and of course the owner said she would, but when my wife got the jacket back it was faded, and the button was ripped out. My wife told the owner that she needs to fix the jacket, but the lady refused to acknowledge her mistake, or even attempt to try and fix it and told her to get the F*&# out! I don't understand the previous comment about \"Mom and pop type feel\", I would call it \"North Korean communist dry cleaners type feel\".", "business_id": "a8-3NAyg8WQ1gVY0RFDMcg", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-10-13", "type": "review"}
