It may not be pretty on the outside (or the inside for that matter), but it's the perfect bar vibe for me. The crowd that goes here is relatively tame as well. They have some really good drink specials - for instance, you can come in during Friday happy hour for a burger + fries priced around $3-4! Wow! And I haven't even started about Big Ass Drafts on Sunday! The food is okay, but the thing you need to get if you go here is the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. It's actually really good. Apparently, it's not that frozen stuff they have at Applebee's. Someone actually makes a whole bunch of it everyday. Other than that, everything else is standard bar food. But you really don't go to Cornerstone for the food anyways. The bartenders/servers/bouncers are all very nice also. You never feel rushed, and they are all nice and chatty if you put yourself out there. But don't be a drunk ass and argue with the bouncers, however, because that never ends out in your favor. But I mean come on, that's common sense, right? Overall, the service is great. If you're looking to get some drinks with some friends, come by before 9:00 PM because things start getting pretty crazy after that (especially during the semester weekends). And hey, if you're looking to dance the night away, this is the right place for that too! In all, Cornerstone is a nice place to get some drinks after classes, and it's also good for the weekend rage scene - just know what time to go. With some good drink specials and it's close proximity to the campus, it's where you can always find me on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday night in College Park.", "business_id": "eXH7pwWGVPu0564Co0__8Q", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-09-05", "type": "review"}
