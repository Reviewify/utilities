I would say one of the best in the area but that is a little biased as there are not many pho restaurants in chapel hill :) Pros are that the food is pretty good and authentic with reasonable prices, cons would be a small location/limited seating---- there is always a wait. I am vietnamese and have eaten pho all my life-- this is the first place where the pho makes me very sleepy afterwards...I'm thinking they use tons of MSG, but not sure. Not a bad deal to eat and go to sleep after a good meal!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lvSBv-XzfzFj3oT2l6q4Jw"}
