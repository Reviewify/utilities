The spa is nice with many services.  I know their waxing and facials are nice, but I go somewhere else for that (see my other reviews for the best wax and facial by Zoey at Just wax it).  I went to Beautique for a haircut recommended by a client of mine.  I had this French lady named Belline.  DON'T EVER BOOK WITH Belline.  Belline is Horrible.  She has no clue how to layer hair, but she is so arrogant (typical french) that she refuses to listen and consider the fact that you might have an opinion).  My hair was long, and she chopped it all off, did not know how to layer, so it took her 2 hours to chop it up section by section.  I look terrible, and will have to wait a very long time to  grow it out.  I complained to the management, they gave me the service at no charge but that is no consolation for the way my hair looks.  I have straight hair so I can't hide the terrible uneven layers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k_mu95p5TQlk7Vahw_9keg"}
