I took in a footstool that was well beyond its best years. It had been in my parents' house when I was growing up and held a lot of sentimental value. I got great info on what it would take.to re-do it and help picking out a new leather to cover it.\n\nHarman's reupholstered it beautifully despite the fact that it was a very tricky style. The work was done on time as promised. \n\nIt definitely wasn't an inexpensive process but I felt that the price was appropriate (especially given the quality). I've already taken a second pie e of furniture over to them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "pn2t5UU1wzIM3wU0K0EBIA"}
