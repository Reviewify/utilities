When we went inside the restaurant... it was stinkin' hot! i dunno whether the AC unit was busted or they just refused to turn it on or something, but it felt like a sauna inside. And with a busy Sunday crowd in the afternoon, the place started to smell of musty peoplesmell. Bleh...\n\nTo top off the experience, we made our orders and whilst i got my regular choco Frosty on time, my friend had waited nearly 10 mins to get his Frosty. There were other people after us that got the more fancier Frosties and it came out before his did. i was almost done with mine when my friend got his\n\nOtherwise, i rather like Wendy's food and as i mentioned before, my visits here are drive-thru based than not. After last Sunday's debacle however, i'm not sure whether i'd ever want to dine in that particular Wendy's ever again", "type": "review", "business_id": "4A3NH14ohorJc0s_meewkQ"}
