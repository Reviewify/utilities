Olive Garden, Pasta Pomodoro cant beat Gypsies' pasta. And for $6.89, you cant beat that. Huge portions, hot and right out of the pan. You just cant beat it.  Parking can be a little hectic and the restroom is no where to be found. But thats okay.  I recommend ANYTHING on the menu. Last, I wish there was a dish with chicken and shrimp alfredo or whatever with penne. That would be a killer. Or maybe I'm not looking at the menu long enough because craving for pasta clutters the mind?", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-08-04", "type": "review"}
