And for $6.89, you cant beat that. Huge portions, hot and right out of the pan. You just cant beat it. \n\nParking can be a little hectic and the restroom is no where to be found. But thats okay. \n\nI recommend ANYTHING on the menu.\n\nLast, I wish there was a dish with chicken and shrimp alfredo or whatever with penne. That would be a killer. Or maybe I'm not looking at the menu long enough because craving for pasta clutters the mind?", "type": "review", "business_id": "Kq6uUzRw-iaqe4p7cLLmBQ"}
