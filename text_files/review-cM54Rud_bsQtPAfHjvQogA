This is most definitely the best value as far as good sushi places go. \n\nMy bf & his roommate starting coming here years ago & introduced me to the place. It's owned by a great family, always super friendly & great service. The dad made our sushi this last time. He recommended the asst. sashimi & picked out the BEST fish for me & even made me try some new things. The king mackerel is amazing and the yellowtail is the closest thing to perfect I've ever tasted. I mostly order off of the specials board and my favorite item is the crispy spicy albacore. Another amazing dish is the shiso leaf tempura w/ spicy tuna. I never remember what its actually called, but they know what I mean since I order it every time. Everything is very reasonably priced and the fish is always good. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to everyone! I'm pretty sure I'll be there tonight or tomorrow night :) I am hoping they don't run out of the hamachi kama by the time I get there!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SASKKO2nRWJ5UOH2ZiF91g"}
