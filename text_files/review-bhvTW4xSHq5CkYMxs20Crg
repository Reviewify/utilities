In fact, Charley's has one of the best late night drink specials in town: really cheap pitchers of beer, long islands, and margaritas.  It was my favorite place to go drinking with a large group because of the many long tables.  The food isn't great, but is not abysmal.  The most complaints from my crowd seem to concern the service.  We always got stuck in this one really spacey waitress's section, and people went berserk.  She even overcharged my credit card once.  But she was really cute, and after a few margaritas, everything was perfect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eYIuAjNXVkDriaVZLO5pMg"}
