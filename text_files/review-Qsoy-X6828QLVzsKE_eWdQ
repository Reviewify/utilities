It just doesn't have any five star dazzle.  There is lots of parking, you don't wait longer than five minutes for your food, and well  its actually a pretty tasty meal.  But again, nothing special. Good for lunch or a quick dinner. Happy eating!", "business_id": "EZ0hSOUkt6wjSpTA6jLBXg", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-07-17", "type": "review"}
