It just doesn't have any five star dazzle. \n\nThere is lots of parking, you don't wait longer than five minutes for your food, and well  its actually a pretty tasty meal. \n\nBut again, nothing special. Good for lunch or a quick dinner.\n\nHappy eating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "EZ0hSOUkt6wjSpTA6jLBXg"}
