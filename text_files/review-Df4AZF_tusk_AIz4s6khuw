The building itself looks like a historic mansion, and the facilities are beautiful.  When my taxi pulled up, a bellhop ran over and opened the door for me and took my bags.\n\nThe checkin staff was also very polite and helpful.  You get a chocolate chip cookie when you check in, which was cute, and the rooms were clean and well-maintained.  The decor was a bit more old-fashioned and quaint than your typical hotel, which fit with the whole mansion theme.\n\nI was here for a conference, so I got to have some of the restaurant's catered food.  Very good, excellent all around.\n\nI enjoyed my experience here, and would love to come back.  My only caveat is that I probably wouldn't stay someplace this nice (read, expensive) if it hadn't been for business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "7n1ytmxMsrCvK7QYx3Uzmw"}
