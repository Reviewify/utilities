I came in late on a Monday night and got excellent service and fish. The Mediterranean Fish is truly excellent. The spicy sauce that it comes with really brings the meal together. There are a few things I would change: first have a smoking and non-smoking section. While I don't start a sneezing fit when I smell smoke from a hookah I do not find it a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy a meal, then again I was there at 10 PM so it might be different at normal dining hours.  Second do something more interesting with the rice. The rice composed a large portion of my plate and I ate it all but it could have been something more. I am confident that the cooks could figure out a way to make it event better.", "business_id": "eaa6cqFPfh5n8RV9k7RhYw", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-06-05", "type": "review"}
