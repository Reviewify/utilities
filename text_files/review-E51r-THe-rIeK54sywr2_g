It's loud, often crowded, but somehow manages to be chill. The loudness provides occasion to get close to your significant other/date in order to hear them. Bonus: on several occasions I've seen/heard actual Irishmen (or really good fakers) at the Field. Lots of student-y 20-somethings frequent the place, but locals can be found there too.", "business_id": "qhz_ypl5rVzP-sJ-7t6ctw", "stars": 4, "date": "2006-09-26", "type": "review"}
