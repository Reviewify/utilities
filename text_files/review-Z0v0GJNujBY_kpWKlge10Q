I tried it at the Downtown Art Walk and was a bit disappointed. The Samosas are pretty good and their freakin huge! Sauces were good too. However I tried the Slumdog and was bummed about it. There wasn't much flavor and was rather bland. I mean no salt, not taste and definitely none of the Indian flavors you would expect. It was as if they had forgotten any seasoning, which I thought was odd, considering the Samosa was nicely seasoned???", "business_id": "NtyjXKWUH_Lc0XEbxhp_1g", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-03-17", "type": "review"}
