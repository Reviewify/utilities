Seriously. It was like walking into \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" or for you old school Disneyland fans, the Adventure Thru Inner Space. Yes, I totally just aged myself. Unfortunately, the super-cool interior was not matched by the food or the service. Our server was aloof and generally not interested in our dining experience. The food was mediocre, at best. We started with sushi, opting for a roll that they call \"Double Impact.\" While it sounds truly bad-ass, it was nothing special. Sadly, this would be as good as the food got. For our main entree, we shared the sea bass and the wasabi-encrusted filet mignon. Blah, blah, blah. Cutting our losses, we skipped dessert and finished the meal with something we knew we could count on......drinks in the bar. The square foam chairs (you have to see them to understand) were a great place to enjoy the vibe and the unique decor of the restaurant. If the rating was based on decor and concept alone, I'd go 5-stars all the way. But, it is a restaurant, and the food just failed to live up to expectations. Thus, 3-stars is all I have to offer Pod.", "business_id": "3gVSrS4kffGGZT8oXHsIcw", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-03", "type": "review"}
