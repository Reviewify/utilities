I ordered the salmon burger with Spanish fries on one occasion, and fish and chips on another.  My friend ordered a salad which looked pretty average, but it's not a salad place per se.  The fries are \"Spanish\"  merely by having jalapenos sprinkled onto regular fries. The salmon was a bit bland for my tastes, but I'm used to eating grilled salted salmon as part of a traditional Japanese breakfast with a bowl of rice and miso soup.  The buns sandwiching the salmon filet had a firm texture which supported their contents adequately.  I would come here if you have a tolerable group of friends and don't care if you can't hear each other too well.  Coming here solo isn't really the best option, as I learned on one of my two visits.  The Spanish fries were a bit salty so I suppose they went well with the salmon burger which lacked salt.  The tartar sauce partially made up for the lack of sodium, however.  I always see a sign out advertising 1/2-off burger hours (from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. on Wednesdays), but I haven't been fortunate enough to have the proper inclination for one during these discount hours.
