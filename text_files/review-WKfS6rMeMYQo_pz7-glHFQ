I've eaten at this restaurant a few times and been happy. Getting take-out/delivery is a different matter, however. The employees communication skills and ability to accurately take down orders by phone are atrocious. I have ordered delivery at least 5 times and their accuracy hovers around 50%. Last time I ordered from here I only received one entree when I had ordered two. What's worse is that the food that they did bring was not at all what I ordered. When I called to complain I got attitude from an unfriendly worker. I wont order from here any more. It's just not worth the aggravation.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jsUTsVpjI5QPtPfaciENHg"}
