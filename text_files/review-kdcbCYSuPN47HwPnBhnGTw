The prices are very fair, the food is good, they offer a nice variety and the atmosphere is fantastic. The shakes are well worth every last one of the million or so calories they contain. Minus one star because they don't handle carry out very well. I've never had an order get mixed up when eating in, but there's about a 30% chance of a screw-up when getting carry out. To the credit of the manager, when I brought this to his attention he was really apologetic, personally verified that my order was correct, and gave me my next meal on the house. So they get the star back =).", "business_id": "o13eH93qmWVNFZogkjhd9w", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-06-02", "type": "review"}
