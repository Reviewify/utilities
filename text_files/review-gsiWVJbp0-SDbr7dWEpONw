I was a bit skeptical..! But my mom's veggie, so decided to give it a try. I was NOT disappointed! The place looked pretty run down on the outside (they had 2003 Zagat ratings posted!), but the inside was pleasantly clean and simple! I mean it was not overly decorated with random Indian artifacts like most desi places these days are, in fact it had a very plain look to it. Our server was very polite and decent. My host on the other hand was really dry and keot giving us weird looks!\n\nWe were not too hungry, so we ordered a papri chat, a plate of samosas, paneer makhani and chapatis.\n\nThe papri chat came as a big plate, and both me and my mom were felt nice and full after it! :p It tastes awesomely yummy! The Samosas were really fresh and hot.\n\nThe paneer makhani was a bit too tomatoey for my palette, but it was still decent! The Chapatis were awesomely soft and fresh ( in fact I can easily say these were the best chapatis I have had outside my own home!) :p\n\nI am clearly a fan! :p\n(not too expensive either! )", "type": "review", "business_id": "cA1dMq-Ewrwo4QUR8_O8lg"}
