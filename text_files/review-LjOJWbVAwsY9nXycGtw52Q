Really delicious sammiches, too. Slightly pricey, but worth it. I love the salmon sammich, I hear the turkey with cranberries & gravy is good, too. There can be a significant wait for food -- it is almost always busy here. Definitely call ahead to place your order. It gets really warm indoors and is quite crowded and loud. Sitting out on the patio can be fun; lots of foot-traffic going by so it is a great place to people-watch.", "business_id": "KGHrM4aF5gWJMW5S7z-xwQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2007-06-05", "type": "review"}
