For what it's trying to be-- a hip, upscale and trendy bar for all tastes-- it succeeds fairly well.  I think it was opened by the same person who created the now-defunct Fountainhead Lounge in the EAV.  Really nice simple but funky decor inside (the bar changes colors).  The music when I'm there usually switches from latin-inspired to hip-hop to chill-out lounge.  The drinks can be expensive, depending on what you order, but you should expect that from any bar of this ilk.  Ironically I've never been there on gay Thursdays, but there's usually gay men there all the time anyway.  This is the kind of bar where people will go to wear their Versace and trendy clothes.  Definitely part of that \"New Buckhead\" scene even though it's not in New Buckhead.  I'll go on the weekends, around 10 or 11 so that I'm ready to leave when the trendy crowd arrives to fucks everything up.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IVrNWF-tF5n-KjbhWhXYtw"}
