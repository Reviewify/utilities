My husband had the clam chowder which was pretty good, very hearty and creamy.  I had the lobster bisque which was good, but I would go for the chowder next time. I had the crab cakes with shrimp and scallops and my husband had the lobster. Everything was pretty good, but not knock-your socks off.  The portions were skimpy in my opinion for the price, particularly the side order of spinach and asparagus...I think they gave us like three asparagus...The service was great though.  Our waiter was very attentive and personable, but I could tell the place is a bit pretentious.", "business_id": "cjjTKskdj-f8dHYU_0AtIw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-05-07", "type": "review"}
