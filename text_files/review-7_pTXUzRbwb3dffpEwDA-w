I could care less about the dancing. I'm here for the food, and in ZuZu!'s case, I should have sent a proxy. The grub is palatable but average - given ZuZu! is part of the Middle East empire, and the ME's food is also pretty mediocre, there's really no surprise there. We had the Vegetarian Pupu platter and while it offered a fun mix of treats, there was nothing in the mix that made me want to come back for more. Everything was average. Which is a pity, because if you are going to get down and dirty with the spreads and fried goodies, they better be mind blowing. And my mind wasn't. I have no idea what ZuZu! is like during dance nights because we came here for a quick bite before an opening and got the hell out before the disco began. But I do like the intimate setting, the draft beers, and the friendly but spotty service. I would expect no less of the hipster staff.", "business_id": "GLP0_Rs2y4Q0Gxk7r1dddQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-25", "type": "review"}
