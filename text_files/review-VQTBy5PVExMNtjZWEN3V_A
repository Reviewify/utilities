But, I can't do so this time. I had a pretty substandard experience at Blockley.\n\nFirst the upsides: the food was delicious. I couldn't believe how fantastic the maple ginger wings were. They were very large, and perfectly cooked. My wife had a Greek pita wrap, which she enjoyed.\n\nThe downsides: first off, for lunch anyway, it feels like service is an afterthought. The bartender waited on the tables and tended bar at the same time. While he was a nice guy, he never brought us plates for our appetizers, and then he made what I consider to be the cardinal sin of the food service industry: he didn't tell us until AFTER WE HAD FINISHED that the credit card machine was down. His suggestion: \"we have an ATM.\" Result: $3 in fees to crummy ATM + $1.50 in fees to my bank. Given that I am allergic to fees of any kind, this killed me. He really should have told us before we ordered.\n\nNeedless to say, as I don't think my heart can handle another round of gargantuan ATM fees, we won't be coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4zEqYybRD1FQssLGaJnNZA"}
