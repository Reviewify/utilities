In my opinion Los Angeles County has three amazing doughnut shops. The first is Randy's in Inglewood, the second is The Donut Man in Glendora, and the third is Stan's in Westwood. Stan's is a little different from the other two places. Most donuts are kind of fluffy and light but Stan's donuts are a little heavier and doughier. I have been to Stan's on numerous occasions and every time I have left a happy customer. These are some of my favorite donuts from Stan's. Peanut Butter Banana Chocolate Chip Donut- By far the best donut as Stan's. This big donut is filled with peanut butter and fresh bananas and topped with chocolate glaze and chocolate chips. Peanut Butter and Jelly- Just like the sandwich, amazing. Blueberry Cheese- Donut filled with cream cheese and topped with blueberries and powdered sugar. Stan's Doughnuts is also cheap, most of their donuts are not more then a dollar or two. I just wish Stan's would take debit and credit cards because I never carry cash and every time I use the ATM located in Stan's shop I get hit with those dumb fees. If you have never been to Stan's I suggest you head out to Westwood and pick up a dozen donuts. These donuts are so good I'm positive they can satisfy anybody's sweet tooth, they always seem to do the trick for me.", "business_id": "rNIKiUYsFlBdQ7xoOmYj4Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-08-19", "type": "review"}
