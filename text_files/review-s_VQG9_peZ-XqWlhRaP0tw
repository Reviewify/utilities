The first is Randy's in Inglewood, the second is The Donut Man in Glendora, and the third is Stan's in Westwood. Stan's is a little different from the other two places. Most donuts are kind of fluffy and light but Stan's donuts are a little heavier and doughier. I have been to Stan's on numerous occasions and every time I have left a happy customer. These are some of my favorite donuts from Stan's. \nPeanut Butter Banana Chocolate Chip Donut- By far the best donut as Stan's. This big donut is filled with peanut butter and fresh bananas and topped with chocolate glaze and chocolate chips. \nPeanut Butter and Jelly- Just like the sandwich, amazing. \nBlueberry Cheese- Donut filled with cream cheese and topped with blueberries and powdered sugar. \n\nStan's Doughnuts is also cheap, most of their donuts are not more then a dollar or two. I just wish Stan's would take debit and credit cards because I never carry cash and every time I use the ATM located in Stan's shop I get hit with those dumb fees. \n\nIf you have never been to Stan's I suggest you head out to Westwood and pick up a dozen donuts. These donuts are so good I'm positive they can satisfy anybody's sweet tooth, they always seem to do the trick for me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rNIKiUYsFlBdQ7xoOmYj4Q"}
