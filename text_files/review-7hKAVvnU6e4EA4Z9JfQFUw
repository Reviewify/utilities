I wouldn't want to let the way they're always sitting outside my favourite drinking establishments cloud my judgement.\nAnd they're still great!\nIf you haven't eaten here yet, you owe yourself a potato and chorizo taco. (If you're really a sucker for the pork, you can add bacon to it, as a friend of mine always does. He swears it's transcendent.) Personally, I really dig the fresh guacamole and the tasty (also fresh!) salsas, and I like my tacos a little lighter. I tend for the Green Monstah with chicken, or the ground beef with Napalm sauce. (Which is awesome. Put it on everything. Sparingly.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "L3uemg97EJZ1SfjEE60Qvw"}
