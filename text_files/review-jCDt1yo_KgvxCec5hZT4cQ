The salads are nothing out of the ordinary (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oT5CgJxBYnhu9i0t4xbOUA?select=izVRQ6F3qreuSzAUOZLsag). Picture various meats, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese tossed together and you'll probably imagine something fairly close to what their salad was like. The pizzas, however, really sucked or were mindblowingly good. The Florentine pizza, for example, was hardly edible, while the white pizza was heavenly. Lemme break it down: imagine eating a savory slice covered in a heavenly blend of roasted garlic and cheese (white pizza) then grabbing the next slice and sinking your teeth into something that tastes like spinach baby food (Florentine). Similarly, I loved the pizzas with the regular cast of toppings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oT5CgJxBYnhu9i0t4xbOUA?select=UMtmnomqnoKZYLLQ_GSmww), but hated the vegetarian (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oT5CgJxBYnhu9i0t4xbOUA?select=iL4-DkCEbbEAohBIpUIFYw). To make things even more complicated, the good pizzas can be sort of bad depending on when you order them. I had a version of the white pizza the other day that really skimped on the sauce and heavily lost its taste appeal as a result. \n\nAtmosphere: The interior is classy/kitschy. On a scale from Pizza Hut to Bucca, it would fall somewhere in between. There are plenty of large tables in the middle of the restaurant for large groups. \n\nService: Excellent. These guys, however, don't deliver so be prepared to walk/bike/drive. \n\nSynopsis: If you like to gamble, you'll love Tarantino's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oT5CgJxBYnhu9i0t4xbOUA"}
