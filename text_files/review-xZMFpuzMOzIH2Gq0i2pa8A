He quickly diagnosed some spinal problems and started a treatment plan for me that has really helped me to get rid of most of the back and shoulder pain that I have been having. His office is small, very tranquil and soothing, and his manner adds to a very relaxing and rejuvenating experience. It is obvious he knows his stuff, and after one visit I knew I could trust him to be a highly-professional doctor. \nI have recommended him to others and would recommend him to anyone in need of a chiropractor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J6S1cCEfQCZgR44OugpU4Q"}
