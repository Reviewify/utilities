The food is consistently good, especially the tri-tip sandwich.  If you're not in the mood for meat, the Firestone salad is a great choice.  The greens are really fresh and I love the toasted pine nuts in the salad.  The inside can be noisy, but if you're a sports fan, you won't be disappointed with all the big screen tv's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w"}
