Large portions, good atmosphere, good price, and delicious and creative food. So why is it not a 5 star experience? The service. The server was inattentive until we actually had our food and he actually switched our order with the table behind us. The moral of the story though? I will most certainly be going back for more!", "business_id": "GkK2HM1mTNqhR-LSVpdO2A", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-08", "type": "review"}
