Homemade chili. Cheddar cheese. Diced tomatoes.\n\nVerdict: could've been better. Sausage had slight rubbery texture, lacked flavor. Chili was decent. Cheese not melted. Bun fell apart. Got soggy. Didn't try the slaw.\n\nMushroom Burger + Avocado with Chips: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA?select=7txt03TXUd1IdktlOv5wZw) Beef pattie. Garlic mushrooms. Swiss cheese. Sliced Tomato. Chipotle BBQ sauce on the side.\n\nVerdict: OK. Mushrooms, cheese, and avocado were good. Burger lacked that char/grilled flavor. Minus points! Wasn't given any BBQ sauce. Homemade chips are always good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA"}
