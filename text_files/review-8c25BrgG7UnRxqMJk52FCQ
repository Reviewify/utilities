Homemade chili. Cheddar cheese. Diced tomatoes. Verdict: could've been better. Sausage had slight rubbery texture, lacked flavor. Chili was decent. Cheese not melted. Bun fell apart. Got soggy. Didn't try the slaw. Mushroom Burger + Avocado with Chips: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA?select=7txt03TXUd1IdktlOv5wZw) Beef pattie. Garlic mushrooms. Swiss cheese. Sliced Tomato. Chipotle BBQ sauce on the side. Verdict: OK. Mushrooms, cheese, and avocado were good. Burger lacked that char/grilled flavor. Minus points! Wasn't given any BBQ sauce. Homemade chips are always good.", "business_id": "_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-07-01", "type": "review"}
