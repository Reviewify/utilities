Yes I realize it's Princeton, I don't care, you brew your own beer so it should be cheaper than beer that is coming straight from Belgium.\n\nBeer: If you don't like bitter or dark beers I suggest the Honey Blonde, it's delish.\n\nFood: Have the fried pickles, they are not overly fried and batter is light.\nHave the burger with heart attack in a bun....aka the fried, pork belly, cheese, onions, you know heaven.\n\nI do think the ambiance is nice and chill. I prefer the one in Philly the set up is much cooler, they have live music, better food selection (specifically fried avocado fries) AND their bathroom is AWESOME. This location is quieter, more families with their kids come here and their bathroom is not cool at all. \n\nI've only been here once but I wasn't impressed as I was in the one in Philly....so if you're already in Princeton - just take the drive to the other one. Thank me later.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8sGKlCVtewMuA2RGyfatyg"}
