It's quite close to where I live, but I never gave it a chance, because of it's seemingly dumpy appearance. Convinced by a friend of mine to try it out, though, we walk in.\n\nAnd for a couple minutes, we stand there looking around a bit dumbly and wondering what to do before we are unceremoniously seated.\n\nI was not very hungry, so I just got myself a coffee, while my friend ordered a bowl of Bun, the standard rice vermicelli with grilled meats.\n\nThe first oddity I notice is when my coffee comes out, it's in a coffee mug. Everyone who has been to any Viet restaurant worth its salt knows that coffee is freshly dripped at the table, not pre-made and tossed in a cup with some condensed milk.\n\nSecond oddity is the bowl of bun. When it comes out, it comes out with the nuoc mam sauce already in the bowl... at the bottom. Why? I wonder... The sauce is supposed to me on the side, so it can be mixed in with the rest of the dish, not wallowing at the bottom of a big bowl of noodles. It should also be added to taste, there was certainly not enough at the bottom of that bowl to make anything taste like anything.\n\nAnd finally, the yogurt. My mom makes fresh Vietnamese yogurt, and I know a lot of other Viet mothers who make their own as well. Good Vietnamese yogurt is rich, creamy, and slightly sweet. This yogurt was okay, but lacked good thick texture of a well made yogurt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TjVFVa9RidDYgOGhkyqsCw"}
