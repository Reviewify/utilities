The three experiences since, however, have finished my relationship with Amazing Wok. My expectations relatively simple, I think, and they can't seem to meet them. 1) I would like the time estimate to be close. I know unexpected things happen, but don't tell me 10-15 minutes and then not have even started cooking my order when I arrive 15 minutes later. 2) I would like the items I order to actually be in the order. I don't really want to have to make a second trip back because you left something out, or because you gave me the wrong thing. 3) I would like the quality of the food to be somewhat consistent. When I order a spicy item it should be spicy, and the dishes should include the same ingredients every time you make them. If any one of these things went wrong occasionally I could deal with it.  When all three things are problems three visits in a row, I'm out.", "business_id": "nZC0ooChichlR8sUdy4DMQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-06-02", "type": "review"}
