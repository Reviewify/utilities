Dittmers, Schaubs...  Hmmm.  Schaub's!  For their Fred's Steaks and their Prime Bone-In Market Steaks.  No waiting, friendly and often fun service.  Get the Fred's Steak, don't overcook it, and slice it thin.  It rocks.  The best steak I have ever had is their Market Steak, grilled.   I like Dittmers too, but Schaub's whoops them if only for the \"shopping experience\"  which I explain in my Dittmers review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KgSUPZeROhlkhYzxd2g2eg"}
