They should all have their own page. Mexican (Maria's): I like how they give you beans and homemade tortilla chips on the side. The food is a little bland for mexican, but that's what hot sauce is for. Very competent tacos and burritos, especially the adobo, which has a tomato sauce on top. I usually get two meals out of this. So, if 4 or 5 bucks gives you two lunches then that might be as cheap as making your own sandwich at home.  Jerusalem Cafe: Definitely the cheapest on the block. Three dollars gives you enough food for 2 meals. The chicken and rice plates are interesting. Not sure if the veggies are the freshest, but it's not the place to go if you're looking for the freshest.", "business_id": "wF0FCuuLUAF_dcq-CEYLvw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-06-18", "type": "review"}
