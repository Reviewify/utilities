I've only ever really ordered the vermicelli (usually the one with beef AND pork rolls, because I'm greedy) and the spring roll. The spring roll is nothing special, but I do love their vermicelli. The meat is flavored really well and it's yummy and I love the sauce that you pour over the noodles. It's the same typical sauce you get at all Vietnamese restaurants though, so can't rave about it too much. Seating is a bit crowded, as they've tried to smush together as many tables as they could into a small, narrow space.", "business_id": "G6eVUNDvfCiFy8ICavGScQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2010-08-30", "type": "review"}
