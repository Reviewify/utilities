They offer up a great selection of 'american chinese food.'   Contrary to what many other reviewers claim, this is not your run of the mill, greasy, msg-loaded chinese food.  They use extremely fresh vegetables and tofu in their cooking, and the food never glistens with grease. (though I've heard their meat isn't of the same quality  [I'm vegetarian so I can't say for sure]).  The staff are generally helpful and nice, with a few exceptions - all in all they run a very tight ship with prompt service and great food.  The only thing preventing them from getting 5 stars is their high pricing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jZGqAdBlDnrP-J7--vdPxA"}
