I've been coming here for 6+ years since my first introduction to this establishment through a friend.  Hell, I used to top my day off with a gyro or falafel from this place after skipping a class or two. I swear by it and I've not been tempted away by any other place despite my travels into other states/cities. Friendly staff, good food, and open late.  What more can you ask for?", "business_id": "n3KaV4ojMr34zdnJBTvRAw", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-26", "type": "review"}
