As a South Indian, fish is a big part of our meal. So, I got the Curried fish with rice for the entree - Loved it! It had the right amount of spice (it does have a modern twist to the food) and quantity. Also, the presentation was good. About the decor, I liked the openness & modern ambience. The food is reasonably priced plus, the drinks are cheap...~$4 for a glass of good wine! The only minor flaws were - the music (did not fit well with the ambience), the restaurant board outside (easy to miss the place because the sign board outside is not very noticeable). Will go again to try more dishes.", "business_id": "IKpwHpcHWvvQmlfX7IgYWg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-12-29", "type": "review"}
