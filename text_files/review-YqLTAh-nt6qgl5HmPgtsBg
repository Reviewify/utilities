It's also a hangout for the great talents who created the genre. I went there more than a year ago the first time. The first set was good jazz. For some reason I happened to stay long enough to hear the beginning of the second set and just had to stay! It was the great George Coleman and his son - how could you not listen??\n\nMike at the bar is a friendly guy. He suggested I get the strip steak and so I did. It's grass fed and cooked really well. I always sit at the bar, since it's more casual, but you could also get a table if you have a group.\n\nSmoke has an old world feel. Once you're inside you're back in time. I don't know why I don't go more often. I was just there earlier this week so this review is fresh and from the second visit.", "type": "review", "business_id": "trbr9pYDDmXCj9z8m2d6LQ"}
