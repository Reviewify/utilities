So, on the way to campus today, I stopped by here for some breakfast.  \n\nI got the ham & gruyere with scallion organic egg omelette.  It was so good!  Very tasty :)  It came with a nice side of baby greens and mesclun salad, and two slices of bread that I was able to put an organic Belgium praline spread on, as well as some organic \"four fruit\" (strawberries, raspberries, cherry's and currants), compote/jelly on.  \n\nNotice my use of the word organic.  They use many organic ingredients here, which I LOVE!  I am so into restaurants that use organic items in their menu.  This, of course, explains the expensive nature of this place as well.  However, it's very worth it every once in a while (and those of you who are into eating organic and going to farmers' markets, etc.,  will know exactly what I'm talking about).\n\nFinally, I ordered some fresh mint tea which was delicious and went perfectly with my order.\n\nAt the end of eating, I bought a couple of the bread spreads, and some honey to take home with me.  Yes, it was that good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rbc9eyODP68T_DFzIYuNNQ"}
