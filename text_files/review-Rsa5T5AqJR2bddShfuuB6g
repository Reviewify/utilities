It's kind of weird and would maybe be a bit cooler if the service were actually better. I don't know if the staff is inexperienced or if they don't have enough people scheduled, but the waitstaff always seems flustered and well...scarce. \n\nThe food is decent. I really like some of their scrambles and there are a ton of things I would love to try, but I don't know if I can handle making another trip here. It just takes too long and if you don't come early enough on the weekends, you'll have to wait a while for a table making the whole experience drag out even longer. \n\nI also have to add that I really detest their homefries. They seem bland and never quite cooked enough, but my boyfriend loves them, so it might just be me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "yx4IYpg9MGbrVqNdZwXX_A"}
