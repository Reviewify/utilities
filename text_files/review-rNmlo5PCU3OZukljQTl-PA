This is all you need. I can understand once in a while you look for more sophisticated toppings, gourmet cheese, fancy European buns, whatever. This is a hamburger as God intended it to be, juicy flavorful beef, fresh toasty buns, crisp lettuce, tangy sauce and pickles, tomatoes, onions (mine are grilled, thanks) all food groups happily represented in this monument to modern American dinning. The size is perfect for those of us who still chew our food ( sorry, but some burgers elsewhere are just too big). Get some fries and a soda on the side and you will be eating the Americana way. You are gonna love it! And if you left room for dessert, order a piece of the Strawberry Cake. The place is regularly packed, seating is limited, all the signs that tell you the eats here are worth every red cent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sXmUz-g62cYQVyFbGeDq1Q"}
