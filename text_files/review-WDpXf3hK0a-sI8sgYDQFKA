If I were meeting a member of the mafia to discuss some \"business\" this might be the place I'd choose.  I could just envision suited up mobster sitting at a corner booth, sliding a briefcase across the table to the Boss (and I don't mean Springstein).\n\nIf you plan on drinking like a true boozehound, this is not your place; as we all know, mass consumption leads to mass extraction... and the bathroom is way the hell up the stairs in the hotel lobby.\n\nIf you're classy, rich, and in Harvard Square... stop in to Noir for a martini.  If you're average like me, go to a pub for a beer.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HrED44acwUngPkOWS0GUZg"}
