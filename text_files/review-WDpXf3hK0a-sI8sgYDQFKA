Here you have a typical ritzy hotel bar... teetering on the edge of cocktail lounge. If I were meeting a member of the mafia to discuss some \"business\" this might be the place I'd choose. I could just envision suited up mobster sitting at a corner booth, sliding a briefcase across the table to the Boss (and I don't mean Springstein). If you plan on drinking like a true boozehound, this is not your place; as we all know, mass consumption leads to mass extraction... and the bathroom is way the hell up the stairs in the hotel lobby. If you're classy, rich, and in Harvard Square... stop in to Noir for a martini. If you're average like me, go to a pub for a beer.", "business_id": "HrED44acwUngPkOWS0GUZg", "stars": 2, "date": "2009-02-19", "type": "review"}
