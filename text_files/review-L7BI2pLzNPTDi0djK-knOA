Lovebirds sells their pastries at BACKSTAGE CAFE in Burbank. We love the cupcakes....lemon drop, Chocolate Peanut Butter, fresh raspberry etc. So we decided to head for the REAL lovebirds in Pasadena to see what other goodies might await us. To our surprise, the cupcake menu here was completely different and the taste of the cupcakes was also different. While these Pasadena cakes still had good rich moist cake, the buttercream was off. Pistachio tasted like bubble gum, and a supposed cream-cheese icing on the banana cupcake had some kind of horrid ARTIFICIAL banana taste to it. Thumbs way down on the Pasadena cakes, thumbs way up on the Burbank cakes. Service in Pasadena was horrible, took forever to get anyone's attention and when she finally came she was pssd off at the world. Why the four star rating? Because lots of stuff at Lovebirds is worth trying so I wouldn't want to turn people away from this dump. The carrot cake is terrific, and the lemon bars are the pucker-uppy best in town. Peanut Butter, Oatmeal and Raspberry cookies are also very good. But if you want a great cupcake, head only to the Burbank location to try the Lemon Drop or the Raspberry. Yummy Yummy they're Love in my tummy.", "business_id": "Ta8F63eZ2RLXLytYk5vl9w", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-05-16", "type": "review"}
