After a movie at the Brattle, a ravenous friend and I found ourselves at Takemura. We probably should have just bought more popcorn at the theatre and called it a night. My friend ordered two sushi rolls and was moderately disappointed with the flavors. Some of his comments were lost in translation, but it was pretty clear that he wasn't impressed. My vegetable tofu yakisoba was so bland that any amount of soy sauce and pepper still didn't salvage it. We got carded for our drinks, which is fine, but they apparently don't accept international drivers licenses. My buddy washed his food down with a Coke. Maybe I'd give this place 3 stars if my food had cost $5-6, but it didn't. Not worth it. Could have been worse... if we got food poisoning. But it could have been much better.", "business_id": "FHyVE2vrDXqIXeCCqfoyfQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2008-09-28", "type": "review"}
