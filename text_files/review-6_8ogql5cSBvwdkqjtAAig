It's not directly accessible from the street, so you'll have to head in and down a ways (or up some stairs if you come in the back way).\n\nOnce you come in, you get a mild sports bar vibe, with a heavy dash of restaurant mixed in.  There's an indoor and outdoor component, with bars set up in each area for those people who just want a cold one or some apps (the apps are half-off between 5-7 on Mon-Fri). \n\nI had a larger group (10), and a Restaurant.com coupon, both never great things for server to see, but she did a good job overall, getting us things (it was a little slow, but considering the amount of people, the split checks, and the large groups coming in and around, I can understand that)\n\nFor food, I had the sliders; 3 miniburgers with cheese and fried onions.  They were quite tasty, particularly the onions.\n\nPrice-wise, it's not for the meek, or for the grad student level (particularly the dinner menu section, which gets into nice restaurant territory for their more high-quality wars).  They seem to be going for a more professional clientele though, so that works for them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IMnTtFn3c5qZ7gW0gWqPzA"}
