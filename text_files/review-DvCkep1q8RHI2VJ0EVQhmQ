I've been back three times, and have had no horror stories like the first reviewer.\n\nThe chicken is tender and flavorful, the burgers are well made, and very well priced. The fries are made from real potatoes (you can see them cutting them). They have Jarritos as well, which is a plus.\n\nThe staff seems mostly bored to be there, but the food is well priced and a welcome respite from munchie alley down Figueroa. Parking, however is irritatingly small, and you might have to go down the street, but it's well worth your time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "d09ros9QhLRs9EgWbkkvvg"}
