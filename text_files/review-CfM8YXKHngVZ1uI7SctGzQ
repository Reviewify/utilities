I'm serious.\n\nGenerally good selection of art/design books, which is a plus. Fairly small sections for various \"intellectual\"-ish fields (psychology, gender studies, American history, etc.) as well as a sizable amount of graphic novels and fiction.\n\nMy only reason for the 4-star review is that it is nearly impossible to find any specific book you may be looking for, as organization appears to be fairly minimal. The variety and price, however, completely outweigh that fact.", "type": "review", "business_id": "5h5QEu9DCUTxCM4YwtAlrQ"}
