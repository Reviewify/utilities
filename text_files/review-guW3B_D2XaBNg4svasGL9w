They literally have your sandwich made in like 2 minutes, it's beautiful. And the sandwiches are really good. I've never been unhappy with Jimmy Johns, it's perfect for drunk food, sober food, all food. I even had it for breakfast once.\n\nRather than having to fuck around with specifying EXACTLY what you want while they take ages moving the stupid sandwich down the line like at some OTHER sub shops, Jimmy Johns already knows what you want and they are not time wasters with your dinner. Plus it's not too expensive, and sometimes they accidentally give you free cheese. Turkey Tom all the way!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Igr5Id1TWyM3JLsY_td9_w"}
