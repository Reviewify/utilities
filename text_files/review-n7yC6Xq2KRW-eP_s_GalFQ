They are not cheap but they are delicious. The croissants are tasty. Plain is good but pan de chocolat is sexy. The coffee is decent. The sandwiches + salads are decent, kinda small but salad comes w/ a good, flavorful mustardy, balsamic vinaigrette. The service is good. Besides the cookies, I like the atmosphere of this place. It is one of my favorite places in Westwood.", "business_id": "jGHYiK17BNNQxBxMtIBbFQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-10-23", "type": "review"}
