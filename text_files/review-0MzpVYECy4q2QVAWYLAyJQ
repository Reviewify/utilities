Tacos and the Tostada as well as a side of the Platanos y Crema.\nI love that they highlight the vegetarian options with a green V and that they have daily drink specials. We had Honeydew Melon Margaritas. They were amazing. I also tried the Mexican Sangria. Very good.\n\nMy favorite thing BY FAR was dessert. I would have gone there just to sample the entire dessert menu. We shared the El Fuerte! Chocolate Cake, Espresso Ice Cream, Spiced Peanuts, Pretzel \"Dirt\", Patron XO and Caramel.  You could definitely taste the Patron but it wasn't overwhelming. And all those ingredients together were just the perfect combination.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite places.", "type": "review", "business_id": "kVTHnhgYUw-Pmr7wgDB4_g"}
