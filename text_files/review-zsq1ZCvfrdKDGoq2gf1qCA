They may appear all rough and tough on the outside, but given a little advance notice, they're really accommodating! Otherwise, I've been to The Vortex (both locations) many a time, but never did the heavens part the way they did today when I ordered a Vortex Bacon Cheeseburger with Whiskey Pimento Cheese and a side of fried zucchini. Order that with a Spiked Arnold Palmer and we're talking perfection to the tune of angels singing, y'all. Don't plan to stop here if you're in a hurry. The service can be a tad slow (for comparison, I'd say the Midtown location is a bit more spot on here). Overall though, one of my favorite restaurants. Evar. If you haven't been yet (Wait. Why haven't you been yet?), go.", "business_id": "Z2qMwUhnGt_2pA9uQbS7Uw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-18", "type": "review"}
