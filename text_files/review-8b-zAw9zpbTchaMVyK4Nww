In need of a cheap slice of pizza, quickly? Go here. Need a smoothie? Don't bother. Need a calzone? Really, don't go here. The smoothie wasn't terrible, it just wasn't...smooth. Too much orange juice and not enough yogurt or whatever else makes a smoothie have that creamy texture. While the cheese calzone was big and dirt cheap ($3.25), I really don't comprehend the idea of getting a calzone with the marinara on the side and spreading it on yourself. Is it just a West Coast thing to have it cooked already inside?", "business_id": "nfHJNQyVw4M6VTx5bqvnxw", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-09-11", "type": "review"}
