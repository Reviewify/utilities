FOOD: My favorite thing about this place is the endless possibilities of the kind of burger you want. My usual: double, provolone, fried egg, grilled onions and mushrooms, tomato, lettuce, ketchup, on kaiser bun. I have never been disappointed. I also LOVE LOVE LOVE their fried vegetables... especially their fried mushrooms. Adore their onion rings! (just don't expect the typical rings... they are more like spools and spools of onions straw) I like to order my own burger and share a fried vegetable or two with someone else. Try adding the fried onions into your burger... YUM! ATMOSPHERE: definitely a hole in the wall sort of place... which I love! SERVICE: They are typically known as the 'yell at the customer' type of place (in a quirky fun kind of way) but they really aren't that bad. If you are scared... don't be! Just stay in line accordingly and only answer when asked.... you'll be fine! PRICE: cheap and delicious fast food... yup yup!", "business_id": "THJN6kVcPUD2T04TrcmZng", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-06-22", "type": "review"}
