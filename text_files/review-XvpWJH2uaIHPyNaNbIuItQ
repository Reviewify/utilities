The floor through stairway of the brick building makes a dramatic setting for their particular style of hip nostalgic clothes and household goods offered by Urban Outfitters.  I admire the ambience and witty book and novelty selection.  A great selection of photo frames and cameras is a good resource for the photo inclined, as are the Uber trendy design books.  The clothing bears a vintage stamp, and the accessories are sharp.  I found a furry hunter's hood for my cousin, and a thirties style flowered dress top to wear to parties.  The store is also a staple for their patterned stockings and summer sandals. My favorite department is the household goods, where imaginative textiles entice, as do endlessly changing dishes.  They also have friendly staff, a rarity in San Luis, and well designed bags to carry your purchase home.", "business_id": "5Brp-O7BY1l0sxYkNcK-wA", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-03-19", "type": "review"}
