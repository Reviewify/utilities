Parking: plenty of parking in this huge lot. Salad Bar: Their grilled veggies are delicious (especially the mushrooms). You can easily rake up two pounds of salad just by grabbing ingredients here and there (since there are so many) so be careful! Ready-Made Rotisserie Chicken: it's so dry, I had to take off a star because of it. I couldn't piece together how in the world could a Whole Foods chicken be so... Oh man. Thinking about it brings back bad memories. Service: I think the key here is to be polite. Whenever I am polite, it seems like my entire trip becomes expedited. Since its so close to UCSD, I'm sure they get a lot of rude students that they couldn't care less about - just don't get lumped with that crowd. WiFi: They do have free wireless, but good luck finding a seat. It's usually packed with people eating and students studying. Cheap finds: Some of their good, cheap products are in the individual dispenser section. Banana chips are very cheap by the pound.", "business_id": "cWUiqqkS4cpi_StZWkk-Qw", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-08-03", "type": "review"}
