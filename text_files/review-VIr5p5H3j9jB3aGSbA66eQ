It's always exciting to see and try new things. Their Indian food selection is killer - veggie masala burgers are so addicting! Also, since most of the food only needs to be heated up, it's super convenient for meals when you're pressed for time.  The staff is great - they are always so friendly and willing to help out. The selection is pretty wide spread and there are options for any diets. Unfortunately, some things do go out of stock without notice. My only other complaint is the cramped space you have when it gets moderately busy.", "business_id": "ByX2MkFuD-UsQpSIxiUSUA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-10-14", "type": "review"}
