They carry popular best sellers, along with authors whose books are \"off the beaten track.\" I prefer to shop at HBS over the Coop not only because I'm more likely to find these lesser known authors, but because of the assistance I receive in finding these books. The staff is extremely friendly and fairly knowledgeable. I always walk out assured that I purchased a great book whether it be for a school or leisure. \n\nNow when I want rare books or older books, I go downstairs to HBS' used book department. They carry both remainders and used books on multiple subjects at affordable prices. You never know what you will find. Recently, I found a great book on vintage fashion, but I also found a book published quite recently for a fraction of the cost I would have paid upstairs. I recommend scanning the shelves below before purchasing in the main store. You will be surprised at what you will find. \n\nNote: They also buy books and give you store credit or cash.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6mDTbpkVeRkrLy6M6SeN6Q"}
