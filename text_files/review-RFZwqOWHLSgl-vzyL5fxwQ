The outdoor space in the back with the fountain and decorative lights has a great vibe. 5 stars for the sangria, pizza, and bruschetta. This place seriously makes a mean tomato sauce; you can really taste tomato as opposed to the canned flavor. For the sangria, I like when I can't taste the alcohol too strongly, so it's awesome. Why the one star deduction? The staff isn't very friendly and the annoying alarm buzzer that goes off every 10 mins, 30 mins prior to closing time is really over-the-top and obnoxious. When they say they close at 10 pm, they MEAN that they're closing at 10 pm, and they're not going to let you forget it.", "business_id": "76STjBw88WDHzfF2YLiJJw", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-31", "type": "review"}
