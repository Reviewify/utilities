(he also made a mean old fashioned, yay.) the two of us ordered a couple sides to nibble while we drank, and everything was really delicious. the garlic greens were probably the best, but i was a fan of the beet salad (with toasted hazelnuts) and the fries. the bartender also sent out some crackers and a small plate of cheese, because i had talked longingly about the cheese plate. they also played excellent music, and the lighting was nice and moody. i'll be coming back!", "business_id": "oYN2AV5oYv93Z2NevvOKmA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-09-07", "type": "review"}
