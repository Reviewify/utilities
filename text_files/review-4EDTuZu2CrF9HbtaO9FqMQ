(trust me, kebab and pita should go hand in hand.) she was also slightly slow about finalizing the paycheck, considering there were not many people eating at the time. on a side not, i consider the seating arrangement of casablanca in bad taste. i suppose to maximize profits they wanted as many tables in the restaurant as possible. consequently there is just enough space for one person to squeeze through between tables, making it too close for comfort with fellow patrons. if you want privacy, ask for a booth. if you want to eat authentic and delicious lebanese food in an entertaining atmosphere and have the full wallet to do so, then i recommend you eat at casablanca. but if you don't have the patience or money to deal with sometimes-slow service or high-quality food, then try in-n-out. you pay for what you get.", "business_id": "6v31gzvJ0A_8-JVPjgcF_A", "stars": 5, "date": "2008-11-09", "type": "review"}
