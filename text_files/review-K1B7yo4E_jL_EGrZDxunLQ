One mentions a drive thru, which this location is not, and the other mentions \"old town\" which I assume is Claremont Village, and not where this Starbucks is located.   This is my favorite Starbucks around, and not just because I work 3 doors down from it.  Practically all the baristas are always at their best, at least when I've been in there, which is multiple times daily.  They can get my crazy drink orders correct and can handle the days when I go into their location and order multiple wonky drinks, all with special needs.  Yes, this is standard fare for Starbucks nationwide (worldwide, even), but just because the bar is set high doesn't mean we shouldn't praise them for meeting and even exceeding that, right?", "business_id": "eG6AirpXFWGIaa3W4bm4cg", "stars": 5, "date": "2009-02-06", "type": "review"}
