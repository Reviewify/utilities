They're great if you're in a pinch and don't feel like heading out to Conshohocken to R.E.I., but other than that I can only think of a few reasons to go there.\n\nFor one they have a better selection of women's hiking and active clothing in petite sizes compared to their competitor but you'll also get a heftier price tag to match. Their store brand wicking clothes also hold up better than R.E.I. when it comes to wear and tear and they offer a good selection of backpacking 'intimates' that withstand those days of roughing it. \n\nThe second reason is that they usually have a decent selection of shoes, that is if you can get them to find your size. This doesn't really benefit me any since I am a size 5 and according to employees they don't see the need to order size 5 because no one is a size 5. Umm, ok. I'll let this pass, though, simply because my husband always finds what he needs there and they did have a helmet small enough to fit my head last time we were there.\n\nThe employees can sometimes be toolbags, though. As soon as you walk in they give you the \"Yes, can I help you, why are you here?\" but are never around when you actually need their help. They're usually all bunched up together talking about things like frat parties or climbing movies or whatever it is those adventurous college students talk about now a days.  Even if you know what you're talking about they still act like they know more than you. I don't know if it's just their attitudes or the corporate brainwashing they undergo, but people are just nicer at R.E.I.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v4QsKtLkKYrZYrqvivmsLQ"}
