If you are coming in for servicing, or to ask a question.... not so much. If you didn't buy your item at NM, and want to ask a question, forget it.  The lady at the Jimmy Choo counter made fun of me on the spot, because I didn't buy my bag there.  She wasn't knowledgeable about what she's selling either. I don't care if people are mean, as long as they know their products well, but she clearly didn't. Try Nordstrom instead - they have lifetime guarantees on their handbags, and are much friendlier. :) The watch/jewelry department salespeople were very nice though. I think NM in general is a hit-or-miss in terms of customer service.", "business_id": "PRL7_9l0Zu7w1CpQEj0iEw", "stars": 2, "date": "2010-12-30", "type": "review"}
