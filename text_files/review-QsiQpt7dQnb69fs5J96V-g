I want that to be clear from the get-go. My friend was in town and we were in Cambridge looking for a drink and something to eat. Another friend and former Boston resident used to work at either the Miracle of Science or the Asgard and had recommended one (or both maybe?) So, Brian and I are wandering around looking for the Miracle of Science, which (here's where idiocy comes in) I cannot find. But the Asgard is there, clear as day.\n\nWe pony up to the nearly empty bar and wait to be served. And wait. And wait a little more. No hello. A barest glance of acknowledgement that does not apparently imply future service. No menus. Nada. Maybe we should have taken a table, but the hostess seemed disinclined to lead us to one.\n\nWhen we finally are served, I get potentially the weirdest veggie quesadilla I've ever had. Y'all do seem to like your broccoli and zucchini in Mexican food here. Ok. But eggplant? And watery guacamole? Ew.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dv56VSw7tClqOuTYUrOwJw"}
