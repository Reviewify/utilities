It was disappointing (Subway-like?) and left me hesitant to make an in-person visit, especially when there are plenty of long-term lunch loves in the area that I rendezvous with regularly. Enter Mari J. Who insisted I try them again for a sandwich, or better yet hit 'em up for a delicious biscuit. I work from home people. There's little chance you'll find me at a breakfast joint clear across town at 9am. BUT. As I was heading into Chapel Hill for the Shred-a-thon yesterday, and since there was just a splash about Neal's in the NYT, I decided to hop on over for a bite. So did EVERYone else. The place was packed! And I heard multiple mentions of the Times piece... kudos to these Carrboro kids for landing some big buzz. There are only 3 or 4 tables in the shop, and a few stools on the porch if you want to eat on the railing. I ended up sharing my table with three elderly folks. Note: don't try to bring your grammie here. The poor things could barely perch themselves up on the elevated bar stools. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes... so we're :packed: into this little deli together (and I thought Toast was snug!); but the food still manages to come out quickly. This time I went with the turkey sub, spicy peppers. Yummo. Not Subway for sure. But here's the thing. It seemed a little miniature to me -- like a kid's sized sandwich. Maybe America has trained me to need gigant-o super-sized portions, but this meal struck me as small. Still, I'm a converted fan for the fresh and delicious food. But I'll be doing to-go on next visit. Maybe someone can even motivate me to drag my ass out for one of their breakfasts...", "business_id": "QpEGWNEKeXzYC74gZjpVUw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-04-23", "type": "review"}
