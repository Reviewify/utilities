We ordered the Chili Basil Salmon--one of the BEST Asian seafood dishes I've ever had!  I highly recommend this, since this is what I'll be coming back for on a regular basis.  The Vegetarian Pad Thai is on our top three list compared to the same dish from all of the Thai restaurants we've been to in California (southern Cali and the Bay area), and the Hot Basil Fried Rice is second to our favorite similar dish at Thai Pepper in Huntington Beach, CA.  The  atmosphere is hip and exotic in a casual setting (the restaurant at the back doubles as a cafe, which is located at the front), and our waitress was very warm and friendly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrJzG2UyF6ux2A9v5-fLXA"}
