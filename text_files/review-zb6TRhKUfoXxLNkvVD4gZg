I don't think I've ever been in there without sticking to the floor and I refuse to place anything on that counter.   Second, toppings look like they've been sitting there for over a month.  And that's the just prepackaged ones, I don't even want to think about the fruits after seeing those things.  The selection is VERY small and half of it is your typical vanilla and blah blah.  So if I ever get dragged into this place, I either don't get anything or I get a cup with no toppings (if they actually have the tart yogurt which they rarely do).   Finally, like someone else mentioned, that tip jar.  ?!?!?!??!?!?!?!!?  Please, explain that to me.  They don't even weigh the yogurt for you, that's the least they could do if they wanted a tip, or just give the shit to you.", "business_id": "5XQPGHByJcMr_GqRZNwYMw", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-07-24", "type": "review"}
