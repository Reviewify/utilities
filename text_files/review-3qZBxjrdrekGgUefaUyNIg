My friends and I decided to sit here and enjoy the beautiful day.  The pastry selection is pretty good, I was highly interested in several of the cupcakes they had available along with the apple crisp.  I settled on a Cinnamini and a Rasberry Italian soda.  My Italian soda could have had more syrup in it but that's just because I like sweet things, but nevertheless it was tasty.  The Cinnamini was just enough of a treat that I didn't feel bad about eating it but it was a nice tasty treat.  They have a nice outside patio area for seating although it is shared with a parking lot (that's probably why I never realized it was there)  but I will come here more when I want to relax and people watch downtown.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Zq8I8faj8_VTDFulo8yo6w"}
