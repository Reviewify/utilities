Is it beating a dead horse to write and update for an update?  Whatever the case, this establishment deserves every bit of it.  To sum up the bottom two reviews I previously made, I made some statements, and they were acknowledged by the manager.  \n\nEver since then, I have returned to this location multiple times.  The smoothies were still spot on and consistant.  The pomegranate smoothie is a new favorite of mine, which was discovered this Sunday prior to the World Cup.  It was not too tart as some berries could be, but it wasn't too sweet. \n\nThe employee that was watching the store was cheerful, greeted us, and was patient when I was trying to figure out what I had previously.  As mentioned, I was heading to watch the World Cup, so I wanted to bring two drinks over, but wanted to sit in the store for a bit to enjoy my smoothie.  She was extremely friendly and didn't give me a hard time as some places would for wanting to place an order \"to go\" at a later time.  \n\nThe store is still spotless and stain free.  I am sure I sound like a nut in my reviews commending a place on it's cleanliness, but that is an \"OCD\" of mine.  \n\nWhat deserved the 2-star bump?  Everything.  It's once in a blue moon when anyone would find that kind of service.  The smoothies are still delicious.  This store went above and beyond my expectations.\n\nHats off to you all!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MN7F8UJk33nbYpvDBieIeg"}
