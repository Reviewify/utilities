Not overly buttery like their competitor down the street.  The cupcake was fairly moist\n\nCons: Much smaller than expected.  Especially considering the price!\n\nMuch better than that other cupcake shop!  This was despite the fact that most of the frosting was smeared on the side of the box by the time we got home.  Seemed more homemade.  I would like to try some of their other flavors!", "type": "review", "business_id": "RkYCZKSJ7Qhw7c7ognlm3A"}
