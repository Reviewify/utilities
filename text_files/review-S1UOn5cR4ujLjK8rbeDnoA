First impression was the restaurant was very clean and the service was prompt. I ordered a patty melt combo and it was quickly delivered to my table along with condiment offerings. The patty melt had two patties with cheese and grilled onions. The bread was a bit soggy, but not too bad. The fries were skinny and crispy, great when it was hot but cooled rather quickly. Overall, I will give a solid 4 star for the food and 5 star for service if the rating was done separately.", "business_id": "-CQkVUNdNnWvcMtcsxXjpg", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-18", "type": "review"}
