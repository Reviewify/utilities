I've previously ordered their combo for dinner with bulgogi and felt hungry still afterwards. The portions are medium-sized, potentially bordering on smallish. Most recently, however, I came for lunch and ordered the sizzling hot bibimbap + a pickled seaweed tofu pocket (it doesn't sound so appetizing, but it tastes wonderful). I was sufficiently full afterwards. The food tastes good, and I think perhaps recently this place has turned from an order up front and sit down with your number type place and converted to a regular sit-down restaurant. The most recent time I went, they told us just to sit down and they brought menus. They are very nice about asking if you're a student or AAA member, and I am always pleasantly surprised at bill time when I get the discount applied.", "business_id": "v2oxMmRA3SEr9l4aQvmEMw", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-11-07", "type": "review"}
