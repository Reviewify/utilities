It was the \"Chicken Guadalajara,\" and I ate half of the cheese covered monstrosity before discovering that it's gooey center was raw chicken. The waitress and manager were horrified, and offered me to order something else off the menu. Meh, I don't think so. It is about three hours later and my belly is broiling. How disgusting. I would not eat there again. The place served undercooked, poisonous chicken. How hard is it to cook some chicken???", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-09-17", "type": "review"}
