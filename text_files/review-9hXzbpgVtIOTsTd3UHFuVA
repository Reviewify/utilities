The AC was out AND bathrooms were closed for cleaning. Expect there was NO ONE actually cleaning it!!! We were here on a HOT May afternoon for my cousin's graduation you could only imagine how uncomfortable it was inside. We had decided to come here to get some drinks and sit down and relax a little before the ceremony started since we were there early. BIG MISTAKE. This place is dirty, gross, hot, and overall a complete mess. I feel so bad for USC students if this is the only boba place they have near campus.  They were obviously understaffed....PFFFFFFH who am I kidding, it was just her in the front taking orders and some guy in the back that she kept yelling at to make the drinks.  At first I wanted the taro slush, but the the old asian lady told me that there were no slushes because the ice machine was broken?!?!? Huh okay. So I had to settle for a taro milk tea...which ironically had ice in it. AHAHAH WTF. The drink itself was meh. In the past my cousin had bought me milk tea here once before we came to the actual store...THE ONE DRINK NO ONE COULD EVER SCREW UP AND I MEAN NEVAAAAAR EVER, and the damn thing tasted worse than dog piss. It had gone sour or something and was damn watery. No taste of tea whatsoever.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STATE OF CA HEALTH INSPECTORS SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN!!! HORRIBLE!!! ACK!!! Oh and not that is makes a difference of whether I would come back (which is NEVER) parking sucks!!! :-)", "business_id": "G9A4F5Oi2v0lEkqf27Igzg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-09-20", "type": "review"}
