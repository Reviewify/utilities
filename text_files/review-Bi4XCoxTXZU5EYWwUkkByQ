That's universally a good thing. Their selection is fantastic, everything from racing to mountain bikes and back, with a diverse range of abilities and ages in mind. They have a great amount of accessories, many of which were three degrees away from me ever hearing of them. In talking with the staff, I was incredibly pleased by how friendly and laid-back they were... It's amazing, who knew you could be knowledgeable about bikes but still a decent guy at the same time? I can't comment on their bike shop firsthand, but everything that I saw seemed to be going in good order. If you're in the market for something bike related, Performance should definitely be your first (only) stop in the area.", "business_id": "r47qehlH4U6EP4fPTKu1cQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-07-07", "type": "review"}
