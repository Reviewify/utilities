I'm a big fan of the steak salad, although the fact that it has fries in it really does weird me out.  It is most likely just as fattening as a burger, but it sure does taste good and gets me craving it to come back!\n\nThey also have a great wine selection that is worth checking out.  In a pinch (or during snowpocolypse) they will also sell bottles to-go, but they do have to de-cork it for you before you leave, which is midly annoying, but better than nothing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "aJy5lNyUJjAbdsMrJz3YCg"}
