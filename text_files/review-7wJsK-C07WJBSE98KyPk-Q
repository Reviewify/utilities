The boba everywhere is always rubbery or stale, and the milk tea is always watered down. However, I give Sweetheart's 3 stars, because they have the best Taro Milk Tea that I have tried. It's not too sweet, and usually not too watered down. The service is very fast - there's usually no wait at all. Boba is very inexpensive but filling! AND, Sweethearts is open later than any other boba place. The down sides... People there aren't ever that friendly. It's cash only, which I know is easier for businesses, but sometimes I really don't have cash!", "business_id": "j9tMEV719PzFcc_wp8mzlw", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-08-11", "type": "review"}
