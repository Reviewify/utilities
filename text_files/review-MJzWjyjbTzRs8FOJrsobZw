I got steak fajitas, my bf got a chile verde burrito, chips and salsa, a pitcher of beer, and horchata. The plus is that we got everything for about $20 and it looked pretty. The downside was that the food wasn't very good and made us feel bloated. Haha. The 2nd floor deck is super nice though. I would go there again, but maybe get breakfast because their Mexican food wasn't all that.", "business_id": "BOCJ5g4q1RhP8wikwwr3Ow", "stars": 3, "date": "2009-10-11", "type": "review"}
