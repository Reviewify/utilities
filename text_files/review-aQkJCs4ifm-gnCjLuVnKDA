This is legitimately one of the only places where you will not be inundated with televisions, cargo shorts, and sox caps while having a drink. Priceless. \n\nThat said, paying off the doorman in order to get a group of nine ladies inside on a Saturday night without needing to wait over an hour....pricey. Also exorbitant, will be the amount of energy needed to not shove numerous patrons into a wall because apparently NO ONE knows how to say \"excuse me\" as they are pushing passed. I found this shocking. \n\nIn summary, if you are in Boston need a drink or a place to dance to 90s hip hop on a Saturday night, Middlesex is the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "G4K5wXUe3aZ387yS1Gju7A"}
