I guess they have a few funky things on the walls, like a sign that says \"nothing happened here in 1897\" (ha ha), but beyond that this places sucks. \n\nExpensive, dirty tables, very slow service even when not much is happening, mediocre food, poor selection of beers, loud (but bad) live music so you can't even enjoy your drink let alone talk comfortably to the person next to you.\n\nThis place only exists because there are enough clueless students nearby that will keep it alive. Just another of those semi-frat bars that Boston seems to love.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bzZ7jQ-RXxsD0heDIUzojQ"}
