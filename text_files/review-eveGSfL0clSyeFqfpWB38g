The best I have had in the US and pretty authentic compared to the versions I have tried in Japan.\n\nI recommend trying the Texas Takoyaki Roulette.  7 Normal balls and one filled with a habenero.  I am glad I didn't end up eating the pepper!   \n\nI would definitely go regular with the octopus takoyaki instead of the mushroom one if you are a meat eater.  The mushroom one lacked texture and just contained a small piece of mushy mushroom.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8SqxzaPVVBTIxrbJKZwDxg"}
