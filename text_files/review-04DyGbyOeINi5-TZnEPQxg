I waited about a minute and finally one of the servers walked toward me looked at the take out bag on the counter, mumbled something to me, and went into the kitchen. After another minute the other server walked toward me only to be called away by a third server moving tables, clearly seeing me standing there by the take out bag. So I spoke up saying nicely, 'Excuse me, is there anyone to ring me up? It doesn't seem like anyone wants my money.' The last server laughs but still makes no move to take my money. Finally the second server walks past me to a register, still not acknowledging me. I was left to figure out the she was ringing me up. I felt like telling her that I didn't think I'd be coming back ever. But it didn't seem like she cared anyway.  And to top it off, now back at home after eating, my girlfriend and I don't feel so well.  Definitely not going back.", "business_id": "INaAXfbIXtXTB3sSDX8Wow", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-05-01", "type": "review"}
