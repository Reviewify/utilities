It was too hard to eat and I only had one bite at the cafe. Their portions are very generous so it's a nice deal if you're pretty hungry. Their service is also really fast. They make your food right away and pretty much on the spot. However, none of it was that tasty. The salad was almost too much to work with. Maybe it was the huge pile of sprouts...Anyway, not sure what it was but I only had a few bites of the salad as well.  I ended up taking about 3/4 of it home to try and eat later...but it still wasn't good so I tossed it out and made my own sandwich.  Also - when my girlfriends and I were here eating, there was this weird guy that kept going in and out of the restaurant talking to people...but in a creepy way. He came up to my friend and tried to hold her hand and kept reaching for it. But I guess that's part of what makes Berkeley...Berkeley. =)", "business_id": "j0C1t08TLW_iPPdC-8P_vQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-25", "type": "review"}
