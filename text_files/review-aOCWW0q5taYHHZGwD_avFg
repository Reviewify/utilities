My husband and I went in and were immediately greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff! I ordered a cafe mocha and my husband ordered a latte. Our drinks were great! You can tell the quality of the coffee is one of the best. The cafe mocha had a bit of a tangy/fruity after taste but was so delicious it made me crave more. The atmopshere of the cafe is very relaxed. There is limited seating but it is still a very nice and clean place to go to. Love the coffee. Would definitely go here again!", "business_id": "IotuxJ8M1kDe9lK-cd1asQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-10-05", "type": "review"}
