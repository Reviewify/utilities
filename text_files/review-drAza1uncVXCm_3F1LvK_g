Price is pretty good for the portions you get, as one pasta will definitely be enough to feed one person. It's location makes it very accessible to USC students, and anyone in the neighborhood should probably stop by here if they're looking for a pasta fix.\n\nThe food itself is pretty decent, I've been here on multiple occasions. I had the angel hair the first time around, which was pretty good, but for some reason I felt like was loaded with MSG as I was very very thirsty later and I ended up drinking a lot of water after the meal, so I would probably stay away from that. Their pesto farfalle was pretty good, as other people say, one of their better dishes on the menu. Their homemade ravioli is also pretty good, and definitely very filling, if you want a lot of carbs, then the ravioli is your choice. Stay away from the tuna sandwich though, it was really bad. For this place, stick to pasta and you won't really go wrong.\n\nGeneral conclusion: This place is good because of it's location. Given the lack of competent Italian restaurants in the area, this place is worth coming to because of it's pretty generous portions, low prices, and decent quality. It's definitely nothing compared to a legit italian restaurants, but it's good enough to satisfy the pasta cravings of college kids.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SjHffWyYrmra21OJN78SJw"}
