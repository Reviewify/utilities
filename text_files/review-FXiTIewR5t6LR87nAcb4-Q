We came in on a Wednesday night at about 8:30 and we were seated right away by a smiling hostess. Yummy margaritas, and delish taco and enchilada combo. Fresh salsa and warm tortilla chips on the table makes me a happy gal. The server was chill and took good care of us. What a great place for a Yelp Triple Date! The only thing I can tell them that would improve this place is to expand their whiskey inventory to include Jameson. I will definitely be back... soon.", "business_id": "pvlM--HZY1a8SqMXiwEz1A", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-07-03", "type": "review"}
