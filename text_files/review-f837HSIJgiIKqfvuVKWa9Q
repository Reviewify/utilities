If you are looking for a local place in Providence, this is it.  They offer a wide range of sandwiches from the meat eater to the vegetarian.  If you like homemade, unique food you will find it here.  My fiance and I stopped here on our walk up to Brown and I am so happy we ran into this place,  don't let the chipped paint turn you away this place is amazing.  Eat all the pickles you like with your sandwich, we shared the Barbara Morse because we are vegetarian and it was huge, fresh spinach, homemade hummus on dark rye bread! Yum!!!", "business_id": "t2tHuFNhPhlknnML7kzLww", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-05-16", "type": "review"}
