Now every time I am here, I have to stop by there at least once!! I love their Buffalo Wrap hands down. My nephew gets the Cheesy French Fry Wrap and adds chicken (it's a cholesterol bomb for sure, but a treat nonetheless). Love the crinkle fries, I only get the boneless wings and those are delicious! They have such a variety of flavors, you won't be disappointed with anything! I highly recommended trying them out!", "business_id": "8Qwo0gf_3G3C8JPFWbsrog", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-06-15", "type": "review"}
