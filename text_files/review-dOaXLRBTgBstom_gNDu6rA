Just ask the staff, they can tell you anything about books. Especially the older guy... ask him a question, I guarantee he'll know what you're looking for. The collections are a little cluttered, and they're hard to manuever, but overall this place is a good experience. Much more personable than the \"Coop,\" Harvard Book Store is your place to go if you're looking for a book in Harvard Square.", "business_id": "6mDTbpkVeRkrLy6M6SeN6Q", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-03-22", "type": "review"}
