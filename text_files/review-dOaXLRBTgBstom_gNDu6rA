Just ask the staff, they can tell you anything about books.  Especially the older guy... ask him a question, I guarantee he'll know what you're looking for.\n\nThe collections are a little cluttered, and they're hard to manuever, but overall this place is a good experience.\n\nMuch more personable than the \"Coop,\" Harvard Book Store is your place to go if you're looking for a book in Harvard Square.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6mDTbpkVeRkrLy6M6SeN6Q"}
