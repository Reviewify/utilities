Originally, we wanted to try Mo's BBQ but they close at 9pm so we walked for a few blocks and Firestone Grill was still open (yey!).\n\nThe portions were HUGE and the meat was really tasty. We had their trip tip and pig sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. together with a large soda, our dinner was not even $20! Such a good deal for  really great food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JrGSfjRqAtIZjjwC3FFQ4w"}
