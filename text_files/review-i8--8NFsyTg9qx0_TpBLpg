A friend took me here and I'm glad he introduced me!\n\nI had the pad see ew with chicken. I got 4 stars on a range of 1-5. The dinner portion was huge! The price was $8.95. I had dinner, a snack later in the night, and lunch the next day all from this serving. It was a ton of food and delicious! \n\nMy only complaint is that the 4 was not hot at all. It tasted mild. I don't want spice so hot it burns but when getting a 4 on a scale of 1-5 I expect some heat. When I got home I added my own red pepper flakes to kick it up. \n\nThe Yelp check in offer was a free Thai Iced Tea. Score! I really liked this place, I'll be back! Casual and cheap. I wasn't put off by the service at all. The server was friendly enough and no-nonsense.", "type": "review", "business_id": "gPPIvynVCnKsvADSgszAqg"}
