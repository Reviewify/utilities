Food is always fresh and the tastes, plus the mixes of flavors are just heaven on the palette! If you have never tried Vietnamese food before, Green Leaf is the place to give it a shot. The first time is good, the second time it gets better, and by the third time, you'll be hooked! The wait staff is very good, food is served very quick and the owner is extremely kind.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YuJmfmz5Bryp-zP6NXCXlg"}
