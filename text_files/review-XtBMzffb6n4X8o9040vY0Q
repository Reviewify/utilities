I absolutely CRAVE their Chaats and Lassi's!  Always fresh, affordable, absolutely spotless clean, and the owner is beyond helpful!  Tell him what you like / don't like, and he'll whip you up something unique.  I really can't say enough about it. \n\nI think that the people who gave it low scores just must not understand what exactly a Chaat is... or Indian food... I don't know, because this place is amazing!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qtyNbCXut-RQnnEQNJ9UzA"}
