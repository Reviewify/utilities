I absolutely CRAVE their Chaats and Lassi's!  Always fresh, affordable, absolutely spotless clean, and the owner is beyond helpful!  Tell him what you like / don't like, and he'll whip you up something unique.  I really can't say enough about it.

I don't know, because this place is amazing!", "business_id": "qtyNbCXut-RQnnEQNJ9UzA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-11-09", "type": "review"}
