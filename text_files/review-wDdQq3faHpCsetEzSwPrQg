It rivals the food at my favorite pizza joint in NYC. The prosciutto and arugula pie I had tonight was an explosion of delicate flavors and quality ingredients. I've also had the farmer's special pizza (sweet potatoes, pine nuts and arugula). Even the pies that don't sound like they'll be good are actually fantastic (e.g. red onion & pistachio). This is your place if you like thin crust. The salads are also tasty. My date doesn't eat salad, but she ate a ton of the beet salad I ordered. The dining atmosphere is clean and modern with some rustic charm. The wait staff was great tonight - It felt like our waitress had esp, she knew exactly when to come by. Skip Main Street.... or don't, I want to keep this place a secret. Mani's a gem.. it exceeded all of my expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4REtzXpQYy8dVev8RjWbSQ"}
