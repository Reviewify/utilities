I am an Indian and a place like this should shut itself down and definitely not call it 'authentic' Indian food. I ordered chhola bhatura and it was no where near what this Indian dish looks and tastes like. Above all, me and my wife both fell sick after eating their horrible food. I won't suggest anyone to go there unless I want to avenge them. This place is a big time bummer.", "business_id": "_--ScmaNumIoT2gQanACvg", "stars": 1, "date": "2008-11-10", "type": "review"}
