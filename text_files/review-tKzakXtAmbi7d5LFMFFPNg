They're a \"small chain\" that is growing larger and larger. Their product is mass produced and probably from factory farms. 2. The frozen yogurt is artificial tasting. They have two \"tart\" flavors (which have that familiar froyo tang), while the rest are overly sweet fake flavors like cake batter and cookies and cream. If that's your taste, fine. However, it definitely is not traditional frozen yogurt. 3. 49 cents per ounce adds up very very quickly. If you're getting a tiny amount, it may be less than GoBerry. However, if you fill up a large cup with toppings, you can easily spend well over 8 or 9 dollars. At GoBerry you can get a large with as many toppings there as you'd like for 7.25...and trust me, you really don't need that much frozen yogurt. 4. These guys aren't nearly as clean and sanitary as you'd think from their visage. They rarely if ever flip their lines. They serve old fruit (moldy parts get cut off while the rest of the fruit is served). They top things off. If you know anything about food safety, you know that this is really bad form. All in all, it's worth going somewhere clean, local, and with higher quality product. GoBerry is the way to go if you want the real mccoy.", "business_id": "b88HUwXarEDlFehKzaqzBg", "stars": 1, "date": "2012-07-03", "type": "review"}
