Location, service, atmosphere, bar, and drinks (cucumber martini) are all top notch. The food, is the best part and I keep going back. Coming from Seattle, sushi is VERY competitive and good (top notch, especially compare to what is available in Boston)... having moved back to Boston looking for a good sushi place (but at a 'worth it' price), I was striking out, until Fuji @ Kendall. For all those complaining about the size of the sushi, understand, actual sushi in Japan is not the huge american size, so please be respectful to people who make actual sushi. On to the food: They offer a great selection of different kinds of rolls, and do a great job explaining (to those who may not understand) what each contains. The best and most important thing about Sushi (and where most other Boston places fail) is the quality of the fish. Fuji's quality in fish is very, very good. Has been consistently top notch. Once you add in the mix of rolls (and yes, they dont load you up with rice -- that's real sushi)... it's a wonderful mix. My favorite is the Saba Nigiri ... but that is a very by choice and for people who really love sushi. For rolls, the spicy tuna has a good twist to it. The simple Yellow Tail and Scallions is very solid. Also, they have pan dishes to accomodate those who don't love sushi (not everyone in your party is going to love sushi, so it's great they offer this).", "business_id": "G7iw9QSWBMyB05yvq-xs4Q", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-29", "type": "review"}
