The meat she shaved off was very tough and should have been discarded. The person who got served after me got the really good juicy meat. I've seen other places toss the meat away when it is obviously old. There was a lot of rice and it was a bit hard and tasted dry. The cucumber tomato salad was actually the best thing and unfortunately the smallest portion. Like another person who reviewed the place, I also thought it looked like a lot of meat, but it's arranged so you only see the meat, then later you see it's a thin layer. The slices were thin and kind of sandpapery in texture I guess they don't care if people don't return, I'm certainly not!!!!", "business_id": "qgEx4cus-f9vgc5aBFJ8fQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-12-06", "type": "review"}
