(which means i didn't exactly look at a lot of neighborhoods.) i found the realty pros online and started doing searches there. steve contacted me and we started talking about what we were looking for. the usual shortlist of impossible to fulfill requirements. \"what do you mean the place doesn't come with a unicorn and a genie in a bottle buried in the backyard? keep looking\" he was eventually able to find a place that worked. ok there are three offers on the place. lets keep going. already an offer. ok, again. keep in mind that before we put an application on all of these places we wanted to take a look at what the place looked like. so steve was kind enough to take a video and upload it to youtube. the good news is steve is now a top contributor on youtube sooooo........congratulations! we were eventually able to find a place and get moved into a place that we love and fit all of our requirements. now i just need to figure out what unicorns and genies eat.", "business_id": "6JW3E3NMJTjtp5N0rd4tYA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-01-20", "type": "review"}
