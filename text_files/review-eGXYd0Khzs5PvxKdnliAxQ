I went to the drive-thru to grab a quick lunch before I went into the office. I bought 2 cheeseburgers, and when I got to my office, I found there was only ONE cheeseburger. This was supposed to be my lunch... the sticker on the bag that says \"Double Checked for Accuracy\" is just laughing at me right now. Either they didn't double check it, or they don't know how to count. I don't understand the satisfaction of scamming 99 cents from customers, but whatever makes you sleep at night I guess. The only reason I ever go to this McDonalds is because it's close to USC and close to my apartment. I really dislike this McDonalds. Really really dislike. OH. AND you will almost ALWAYS get homeless/hobos loitering outside, asking you for money.", "business_id": "n1yu-g8KobLRt81pNNskhA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-05-18", "type": "review"}
