I was excited because I had gone to UofM for undergrad and had always heard of the Heidelberg and really wanted to check it out.  My buddies were talking about the \"Das Boot\".  We got seated and decided on the 2L \"Das Boot\".  The waiter was very courteous, but was a bit nervous.  The waiter had to check to see if they had five 2L Das Boot's.  He went and let us know that they only had four, so we changed the fifth order to 1L... \n\nWe ordered food and the waiter had said that he had to charge us for  water?!?!?  He had said that the manager stated that if we wanted more water we would be charged $2 for bottled water.   \n\nBut the waiter was nice enough to bring us more water.  The waiter was really nervous because he had mentioned how he had to sell us the bottled water for $2 or he would get fired.  \n\nWe asked to speak to the manager and the manager avoided us and avoided our table.  \n\nI think the manager is racist b/c our table was the only table in the restaurant full of Asians.  \n\nThe manager is terrible and intimidates their employees.", "type": "review", "business_id": "279Aj_4Hd7EhoAZOiip42g"}
