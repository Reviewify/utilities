I heard so many good things about this place that when I visited over memorial day weekend it was on the top of my list. Their menu looked good, lots of options-I figured at least the drinks were going to be good... To make a VERY long story short, don't go here! It took two hours for me and my three friends to be served and get our food. We quickly ate our food which only lead to more disappointment as our orders were wrong and the food was mildly higher than inedible. Our waiter took forever, messed up our order and there was some annoying kid in a big party playing a flute. After waiting for my margarita for 30 minutes, that flute almost ended up in whole other than that kids mouth. (sorry, the experience was very annoying).", "business_id": "fL_ilXgNUq_j9vMpZwdcLg", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-05-27", "type": "review"}
