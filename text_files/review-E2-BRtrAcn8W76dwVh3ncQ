After searching the area and trying a few local places I was happy to say that they are by far better than some of the other groomers that make you feel  like your dog is getting a fancy spa treatment only to charge you a high price for work not as good as Erin and Wenchi. I found them on yelp and while I was hesitant to try yet another groomer and be disappointed I'm so glad I did. Over the phone Wenchi was great. She gave me a same day appointed and talked about everything that would be done. When I got there they were even more friendly in person!! This was great to know considering other places treat you just like a number. I felt confident leaving my Ziggy there with them. A while later when I picked him up he looked perfect. Other places time and time again never gave me exactly what I wanted. I was completely happy. I also like how they offer frontline treatments with their cuts. This was a plus for me since sometimes buying a 3 month supply all at once can be costly. All in all these gals are great, affordable, they really show compassion for your pets and they do wonderful work. I am happy I no longer have to search for a new groomer. =)", "business_id": "KrCcjselK7f1NhnTOLJeCg", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-16", "type": "review"}
