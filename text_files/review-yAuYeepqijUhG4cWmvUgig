Before you go in stop and look at the bakery case in the front window.  By the time you get inside and look at the other cases inside you'll be ready to eat one of everything - get eye candy. I love this place and it is a great place to stop for an afternoon snack and coffee.  You'll love the decor and the food. \n\nCannoli - 5 stars\nCupcakes - 5 stars\nCookies  huge\nLattes - passable\nStaff - outstanding", "type": "review", "business_id": "2HbFfXouEiPG1U-5Z7zoNA"}
