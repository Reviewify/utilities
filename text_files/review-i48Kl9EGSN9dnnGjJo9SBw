This place is in the \"food court / mall\" and so far from trying half the places there is the best place by far. They have specials of the day which are the cheaper of their meals. Look to spend about $10-15 here. $4-7 if you go with the specials and no drink. The presentation of the food is great and it also tastes very good. It's a little expensive for where it is, as its more like a small chique restaurant than a food course place. Everything was very tastey that I had Chicken sandwich and fries (came with the sandwich of the day). Portions are just enough to fill but not overload. They also have three sauces to put on your food, the yellow I thought was very good. The red is spicy which my coworkers liked. Overall this is a pretty good place to eat in a meh area.", "business_id": "3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g", "stars": 4, "date": "2009-12-16", "type": "review"}
