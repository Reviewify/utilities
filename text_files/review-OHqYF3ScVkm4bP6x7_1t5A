This is the most unprofessional and fraudulent company around. No real \"matching\" takes place. Essentially, you are another body to fill their quota for them month. Example 1: They send me down to meet a short Indian guy (short was out on my list). As soon as we sit down the guy starts talking about his date for the next day. I relay this to the IJL people and the respone was \"oh yeah, we get that a lot with this guy\". Everytime they call you hear a bunch of sorority girls giglling on the phone. And every time they call they have the \"perfect match\" for you. \"great eyes\" \"loves to work out\" \"really attractive\". If I could give this zero stars I would. It is a total waste of time and energy. Go use match etc because the level of people on here is terrible. I should note that on each of the dates I went on, the other person was pissed at the level of professionalism at IJL.
