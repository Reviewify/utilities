Vareli is a fine addition to the MSH neighborhood.  The rustic decor and friendly, attentive staff will bring me back again and again.  They take patron satisfaction seriously since the managers constantly communicate amidst the two floors via secret service type ear pieces.  Only 4 stars for now since I didn't try the food.  I was just drinking at my wine barrel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "v13Ur9Yf2EhvGlvPAaFNeQ"}
