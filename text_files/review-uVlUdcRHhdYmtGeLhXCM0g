As many mentioned in other reviews it's pretty sterile, which is totally fine, but it could use a few knick nacks to give it some character.\n\nOK. The beer list seems good. I ordered a west coast IPA that was tasty. Yay.\n\nNow to the food. Since it was pretty earlier we decided to get the mussels since this was marketed as being a semi-Belgian focused place. Well, I have to say these were about the most boring, tastless mussels I've had in years. They were supposed to be thai curry which one would think would be full of a TON of flavor. They were not. Totally tasteless. \n\nI guess if you market yourself as having a ton of \"belgian\" beer you better have some damn tasty mussels. They go hand and hand. But, sadly Lord Hobo did not pass the test.\n\nI'll give it another try and report back in the coming months.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A3D8gBGNmt51kvcI0GkaGQ"}
