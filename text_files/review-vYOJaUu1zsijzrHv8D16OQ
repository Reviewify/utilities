I could have made it plenty farther, I wasn't on fumes or anything, I just figured, \"why not here?\". Now that I've read the Yelp reviews, I know why.  Doh!\n\nI paid $4.45 per gallon. For regular.  Ugh.  Unfortunately, I hadn't really been paying much attention to prices, so I thought maybe this was just normal SoCal pricing.
