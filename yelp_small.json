I love that I can always find my size in whatever I'm looking for. For the most part, I shop in the Juniors section, but I also like hitting up Topshop and the shoe section, of course.\n\nI had the sweetest girl help me in the Juniors section, her name was Mikaela (not sure I spelled that right). She helped me and my friend from start to finish while helping all the other customers too! \n\nShe rang us up quickly while making great conversation. I felt so taken care of.\n\nAlthough Nordstrom isn't the cheapest place to shop, I absolutely love its styles and service. I would shop here much more often if I had the financial backing to do so!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ncEQCb2Wjk1XfxKxrQD2aQ"}

The filet was perfectly cooked and was of excellent quality. Being that it was a10 oz filet, the price was about 23 dollars which actually is quite reasonable when compared to some other establishments in the Providence area. The service has always been average, never above and beyond but also never bad. \nYou will most likely have to park in the Providence Place mall which will run you a buck for the first three hours. It's an especially nice joint to eat at during the summer. That is when they open all of the street side windows. \nAs far as decor goes. It's a rather elegant place that manages to look sophisticated without being overly stuffy and off putting. \nI highly recommend Joe's to any and everyone. Whether you're looking for a simple burger or a 10 oz filet. Joe's has you covered.", "type": "review", "business_id": "AMcQOPu1hcSl7f6iguru3Q"}
